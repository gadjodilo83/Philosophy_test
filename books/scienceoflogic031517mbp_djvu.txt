THE study of logic is most useful in the cultiva- 
tion and development of the mind. But the means 
of prosecuting this study in the vernacular languages 
of India are very limited. Until recently no works on 
logic could be found in the vernacular. A small tract 
recently published in Urdu called "Ilni i Mantiq," 
while good is still too brief to give any clear knowledge 
of the subject. In Persian some small books on logic 
as the "Suffsd" and "ICubrd" are found, while a 
chapter or section of some other books as the "Darydc 
Latdfat" the MakhMn-ul-ulfan" treats on the subject 
of logic, but these are only accessible to good Persian 
scholars. Still further beyond the reach of ordinary 
readers are the Arabic works on logic from which the 
Persian are taken, such as "liisdla, Shamsiya" and the 
commentaries in Arabic on it, as the " Qutbt." More- 
over the subject as treated is often not very compre- 
hensible to the best of Arabic scholars. The few works 
found in Sanskrit of course are only available to scholars 
in that diflicult language. Such being the state of this 
useful science in India, I have attempted to obviate 
the difficulties in the way of its study by preparing a 
work in Urdu in which the science of logic is treated 
at such length and so fully illustrated by figures and 
practical illustrations that any ordinary student, with 
proper effort, may master it and make it available in 
every day life. 

The book is accompanied by the English as ori- 
ginally composed, from which the Urdu was translated.

ILM i MANTIQ ka parhna zihn ki arastagi aur 
sanwarne ke waste bahnt mufid hai. Lekin is jlm ki 
kitaben Hindustani zabanon men bahut kam hain. Ek 
mukhtasar risala " ILM i MANTIQ" name hal men ba 
zaban i Urdu chhapa liai. Agarchi sab risala achchha 
hai, magar phir bhi aise mukhtasar risala se jlm i Man- 
tiq ka saf hal nahin khulta hai. F&rsi men bhi do ek 
chhofco ohhote risale, maslaii " Sugra," " Kubr&," hain. 
Do char baton yd faslen mantiq ke bayan men " Darya 
o Latafat" aur " Makhzan-ul-IThim" men liklu hain, 
magar in kitdbon se sirf unliiti logon ko faida hai, jo 
Farsi jante hain. Lekin jab ki Farsi zaban men is 
jlm ka sikhna mushkil hua, to Arabi zabaii men ( jis 
se Farsi men tarjuma huu hai,) jaise risala i " Sha- 
msiya" jis la sharli " Qutbi" hai, sikhna iiwam-un-nas 
ko waste balmt mushkil hai. Siwa is ke uii kitabon so 
is ilm ka hal Arabi tiilib ul ilmon ke bhi samajh men 
achchhi tarah naliin ata. Zaban i Sanskrit men chand 
kitaben is ilm ki pin jati liain, magar wuli sirf unhin 
logon ko kam ki hain, jo us mushkil zaban men dakhl 
rnkhte hain. Pas yih -kaifiyat is ilm ki mulk i Hind 
men dekh kar mere dil men aya, ki uii mushkilat ko, 
jo is ilm ke hasil karne men akar parti hain, dsan kar 
doin. Chunanchi isi lihaz se ek kitab ba zabaii i Urdu 
jis men ilm i Mantiq ka hal khub tawalat ko sath likha 
hai, aur ja ba j& shaklon se subut diya hai, aur misa- 
len'aisi sahl sahl hain, ki agar koi aisa waisd talib ul 
ilm bhi dil lagake parhe, to is ilm ko hasil kar le, aur 
roz marra k w&ste nafa uthawe, tdlif k. 



Some native friends acquainted with English requested 
that the work be issued in both languages. It was 
thought that this would greatly aid students of Eng- 
lish in understanding the subject in this language also, 
so that the book would thus answer a double purpose. 

Of the Urdti translation it may be remarked that 
it is not always strictly literal. Where the meaning 
could be better preserved the. translation is free and 
some little change in arrangement has been made to 
suit the terminology of Logic in Urdu. 

Still, as a rule, the Urdu will be found to corres- 
pond closely with the English so that a good end may 
be subserved by retaining both in one volume. With 
the hope that this book may assist the student of logic 
to a better understanding of this useful science it is 
Beit forth.

LOGIC 



LOGIC is the Science and also the ^4r of reasoning. 
As a Science it has reference to the necessary laws of 
thought, in accordance with which the mind acts in the 
search for truth and in conducting a correct argumen- 
tation. As an Art it has special reference to the practi- 
cal rules laid down for conducting an argumentation; 
for guarding against erroneous processes of reasoning 
and the drawing of false conclusions and, in short, for 
making the best practical use of a system of logic. 

2. By some, logic is thought to be one method of 
reasoning. It is thought that there are other modes of 
reasoning besides logical reasoning. Logic is supposed 
to contain rules by which we can so reason as to con- 
found an opponent by forcing him into traps and snares, 
and secure victory even for error. Henco it is 
supposed to be chiefly useful in gaining victory 
in a dispute whether on the side of truth or error, 
and for making a display of smartness and learn- 
ing through pride or for sport. All this is a misap- 
prehension of the real nature and object of Ibgic which 
is not merely a method of reasoning, but is the onltj 
method of reasoning; that is, in the correct search for 
truth the mind acts in but one way or only by certain 
laws. A departure from these laws involves error. 
It is the object, of logic to elucidate these laws and 
furnish rules by which a departure from them may be 
guarded against or detected in an argumentation. 



ILM I MANTIQ. 



1. MANTIQ ek aisd ilm aur fann hai, ki jis se aql 
daurdne aur dalil kd qdnun malum ho jdwe. Istila- 
han, mantiq ko ilm us halat men kahenge, jab aql 
daurane yd dalil karne ke khass qanun ka baydn ho. 
Aur fann us hdlat men bolenge, jab tariqa hujjat ka 
bayan ho, aur galati aur khatd se mahfuz rahne ke ta- 
riqe nmaiyan hon ; yane hasil kalam yih hai, Id fann 
qawaid i mantiq ke istigmal men lane ko kahte hain. 

2. Baz admi gumdn karte hain, ki aql daurane 
ke kai ek qawaniii hain, jin men se mantiq ek hai, 
Wo samajhto hain ki mantiq ek aisa zarig, hai, jis $Q 
mukhatib ko peehida baton men dalkar jhuth ko bhi 
saeh kar de sakte hain. Ohunanchi we khiyal karte 
hain, ki mubahisa men klrwah each par yd jhuth par 
gdlib rahne, aur apne ilm aur zihanat ke zdhir karne 
ke liye khwah gurur ke taur par ho, ya tamaskhur ke 
taur par, wuh kdramad hai. Yih un ki galat fahmi haij 
aur aise logon ko mantiq ki asliyat aur garaz malum 
nahin. Aisa na samajhna chahiye, ki mantiq kai ek 
tariqon men se aql daurane k& ek tariqa hai, balki dar 
haqiqat sirf yihi ek tariqa hai, yane kisi mudrnale k^ 
asliyat o haqiqat ke kamil daryaft karne men zihn sirf 
ek hi taur par un qawaid i muqarrara ke bamujib jo 
Khuda ke banae hain, larta hai ; pas agar in qdnunon 
ke bamujib zihn na daure, to galati men par jdta hai. 

Asl garaz mantiq ki yih hai, ki we qawdnin i 
muqarrara bakhubi z&hir ho jdweij, aur we qdide hdsil

Thus arithmetic is a science, the processes of which 
are carried on by certain laws or rules. These must 
be the same in every age and country and language. 
For instance, the rules for addition, substraction, mul- 
tiplication and division &a, must always be the same. 
Thus logic is the science of reasoning, and if we reason 
correctly at all we must reason by logic. We may 
reason correctly without having a knowledge of therul^s 
cf logic justas hundreds of persons doubtless do. So one 
brought up in the society of those who speak cor- 
rectly will perhaps speak and write correctly without 
knowing the rules of Grammar. Yet it is well to have 
the modes of correct speaking and writing given in 
rules for the instruction of the ignorant and the correc- 
tion of those who do not speak and write correctly. 
In like manner the rules of logic are useful for guard- 
ing against mistakes. They teach us how to detect 
bad arguments. 

3. Some have mistaken the true meaning and 
nature of logic and have imagined that it has a ten- 
dency to destroy belief in the existence of God and the 
truths of religion. They have supposed it is a kind of 
art or trick by which any thing can be made true or 
false at the will of the logician, causing him in the 
end to lose all confidence in any and every truth. All 
this is a great mistake; for logic has a tendency to im- 
prove the mind and guard it against error and con- 
firm it in truth. This will be made plainer iu this 
book. 

4. Logic is a very ancient science and in ancient 
times is found only among two nations, the Greeks 
and Hindus. All other nations seem to have received 
the science from* them. It is not certainly known 

whether the Greeks received it from the Hindus; or the 
Hindus from the Greeks. Some learned men have 



9 

hon, ki jin par agar lihaz rakhd jae, to un qawanin i 
mazkura ke bamujib aql daure, aur agar koi un qawdnin 
se alahidagi ikhtiyar kare, to in qdidon ki ru se us ki 
galati malum ho jae. 

Maslan, hisab ek ilm hai, jis kd istiamal chand 
muqarrar qdidon ke bamujib kiyd jata hai. Aur zurur 
hai, ki yih qaide hamesha har mulk aur har zabdn 
men ek hi hon. Masai to maslan zarur hai, ki qaide 
jamat, tafriq, zarb, taqsim ke hamesha ek hi rahen. 
Aid hdzal qiyds mantiq aql daurane kd ilm hai, aur 
agar ham thik thik aql daurana yd soohna chahen to 
mantiq hi ke bamujib karna hogd. 

Aisa bhi hai, ki aksar log durusti se sochte, mub&- 
hisa karte, aur aql daurate hain b& wujud is amr ke ki 
zara bhi ilm i mantiq ke qawaid se waqif nahin hote, 
jaisa ki aksar hud karta hai, ki baze admi durust likh- 
newalon ki suhbat karke thik likhte aur bolte hain, 
agarchi sarf o nahw se mutlaq bhi w&qif nahin hote. 
Magar bahar hai yih bihtar hai, ki qawaid durust 
likhne aur bolne ke na-waqifon ki talim ke wdste, aur 
un logon ke sudharne ke wfeste, jo ki sahih nahin likh- 
te aur bolte hain, muaiyan hon. Isi tarah par qawaid 
i mantiq, khata aur galati se mahfuz rakhne ke liye, 
aur auron ki khardb o naqis dalilon kd nuqs malum 
karne ke liye kdrdmad hain, 

3. Baze admi mantiq ke matlab o haqiqat se wa- 
qif nahin hain, pas isi jihat se jante hain ki mantiq ke 
sikhne se iatiqdd din par aur Khuda ke wujud par 
qaim nahin rahtd. We khiydl karte hain, ki mantiq 
ek tarah kd hunar yd hikmat hai, jis ke zaria se man- 
tiqi aphi marzi ke muwafiq har ek bat ko jhuth ya 
sach kar sakta hai, yahdn tak ki dkhir anjdm yih hotd 
hai, ki mantiqi kd iatiqdd sachchi bdt par qdim 
nahin rahtd; yih galat fahmi hai, kyunki mantiq 
se quwat i zihni barhti, aur aql saohchai par qaim

thought ihat the Greeks received their knowledge of 
logic from the Hindus while others have thought not. 
Most probably each nation formed the science for itself 
and cultivated it to the degree in which it has been 
found. The Komans received their knowledge of log- 
ic from the Greeks, and other European nations from 
the Romans. The Arabs also received their knowledge 
of logic from the Greeks while the Jews learned from 
the Arabs. 

The first writer or teacher of logic among the 
Greeks, of whom we have any knowledge, was Zeno 
who lived about 488, B. c. There were some good 
things in his logic with somethings obscure and worth- 
less. After Zeno, came Socrates, Euclid of Magera, 
Antisthenes, Achytas, Plato and Aristotle- Zeno and 
some of these writers cultivated a system of sophistical 
wrangling. Among them and their pupils logic seem- 
ed to be simply a kind of recreation and diversion in 
which they occupied themselves for hours in trials of 
each other's acuteness, Socrates who lived 469, B. c., 
made a more worthy use of logic. He desired to see 
logic employed more for the investigation of truth 
and the cultivation of the intellect. He used in rea- 
soning a system of questions and answers leading to a 
conclusion. Plato, the pupil of Socrates, improved 
the science of logic still further but it remained for 
Aristotle, born 384, B. c., to bring the science to some- 
thing like perfection. So that from his day to the 
present, logic, as taught in Europe, is substantially 
that of Aristotle. The works of Aristotle were transla- 
ted into Arabic in the second century after Mahomed ; 
and thus logic as studied among the Musalmans also is 
that of Aristotle. The logical works of the Musalmana 
are chiefly in Arabic with some translations in Persian j 
hence they are not available to the great mass of readers.

ho jati hai, aur khatd o galati se mahfuz rahti hai. 
4. Mantiq baliut purana jlm hai, aur qadim 
zamdnon men sirf do qaumon yane Yunanion aur 
Hinduon ke darmiydn payd jata thd, aur sab qaumon 
ne inhin se yih ilm liyd. Lekin yih thik nahin m?- 
lum hai, ki dya Yunanion ne Hinduon se paya, yd 
Hinduon ko Yundmon se mild. Baze yih gumdn 
karte hain, ki Yunanion ko ilm i mantiq Hinduon se 
mil&, aur baize is ke baraks kahte hain. Aglab hai, ki 
in donon qaumon ne alahida is ilm ko ijad kiya* 
Yunanfon se Eumion ne, aur Bumion se phir Yurap- 
walon ne yih ilm paya. Yun&mon se ahl i Arab ne 
bhi paya, phir un se Yahudion ne h&sil kiya. Maliam 
hota hai, ki Yun&nion men sab se pahla musannif o 
muallim is ilm ka Zino tha, jo Masih se 488 baras 
peshtar Yun6n men tha. Us ki kit&b men chand 
baten achohhi pai jati hain, aur muglaq aur naqis 
bdten bhi hain. Us ke b$d Suqrat aur Uqlaidas 
Mager&w&la aur Antisthenis aur Akytds aur Aflatun 
aur Arastatalis mashMr hue, Zino aur baz auron ne 
in men se ek tarah ki jhuthi aur pechddr taqrir k 
rasm nik&li. Mglum hotd hai, ki un ke aur un ke sha- 
girdon ke darmiyan men yih kaifiyat rahi, ki mantiq 
sirf ek tarah k& khel aur tafrih i taba samjha jata tha, 
jis men ghanton tak auqat sarf karte the, is amr ke 
wdste, ki dekhen kaun tez hai ; magar Suqrat jo 469 
baras peshtar san Tswi ke niaujud tha, achohhi tarah 
mantiq ko isti^tmal men l&y&, aur ohahta tha, ki har ek 
bat ki asliyat o haqiqat ke daryaft karne aur taraqqi i 
zihn aur tahzib i akhlaq ke k&m fiwe. Us ka ek tariqa 
yih thd, ki mub&hisa men saw&l o jaw&b is taur se 
karta tha, ki jo natija wuh ch&ht& tha, wuhi nikle. 
Afldtun shagird i Suqrat ne is ilm ko aur bhi darja i 
taraqqi par pahunohayd. B^d Aflatun ke Arastdtdlis

The great fault of these books is that they are not 
sufficiently plain and comprehensible for the student. 
The subject is left vague and impracticable. It is 
hoped that this book may make it plainer and more 
available in every day life to the student of this useful

PART ! 

1. Logic deals with the laws of the mind in 
thinking and reasoning. The mind is that spiritual, 
immaterial existence within us which perceives and 
feels and thinks. The body is merely its tenament. 
The mind is brought in contact with the material 
world in a mysterious way by means of the five senses, 
sight, hearing, feeling, taste and smell. The mind 
like a mirror receives images through these senses. 
There are various faculties and powers in the mind, 
SDine of which will be noticed in this work. 

2. Logic is concerned with three operations or 
states of the mind, called into exercise in reasoning or 
argument, viz., 1, simple apprehension, 2, judgment or 
proposition, 3, reasoning or argument. Apprehension is 
the first mental state by which we are made aware of 
the existence of an object through perception by 
one or more of the senses ; thus by sight we are made 
aware of the existence of a tree or stone. The state of 
mind as it receives the impression of these objects is 
called " simple apprehension." 

3. Judgment is the second mental state and is 
the comparing together of two apprehensions or ideas 
and pronouncing that they agree or disagree. Thus 
by the sense of sight we get an apprehension of the 
existence of a tree, and by the same sense we get its 
color as a second apprehension. Now the act of the 
mind by which these two apprehensions are compared 
together so that we may say " the tree is green " or 
"the tree is not green" is a judgment. 

Again, by the sense of sight we get the simple 
apprehension of a stone, and by the sense of touch we 
get the apprehension of coldness or warmth in it, and, 
having these two apprehensions, the judgment is that 



HISSA. 



1. ILM i MANTIQ zihnse jlaqa rakhta hai, al-al 
khusus hdlat sochue, aur mubdhisa karue men. Zihn 
wuh ruhani gair-mdddi shai hamare jism men hai jo 
sochtd hai, aur jis se kar ek chiz aur bat malum hoti 
hai. Badan jo hai, sirf us k jd e sukunat hai. Zihn, 
mahsusdt yane, alam i jismani ko aise taur par, jo 
baid-ul-aql hai, ba-zaria hawasa i khamsa ke, malum 
karta hai ; aur hawass i khamsa yih hain, bdsira, 
(yane dekhnewali quwat,) sdmiq, (yane, sunnewali 
quwat,) Idmisa, (yaine, chhunewali quwat,) zdiga, (yane, 
chakhnewali quwat,) shdmma, (y^ine sunghnewdli 
qAwat.) 

Zihn misl Sine ke hai, jis par $ks ban jata hai. 
Agar wuh aks ba-zaria hawass i khamsa ke ban j a we, 
to us ko mahsm, aur agar alawa in hawdson ke kisi aur 
tarah par aks zihn par ban jawe, to us ko maqiil 
bolenge. Jannfi chahiye, ki zihn men kai tarah ki 
quwaten pai jati hain, chunanchi baz ka zikr is kitab 
men awegd. 

2. Ilm i Mantiq tin zihni halaton, yd bdton se 
mutaalliq hai, yane, tasauicttr, aur tasdiq, aur dalil o 
burhdn, wg. Jab kisi shai ki shakhsiyat ya mahiyat ka 
khiydl pahle pahl zihn men ba-zaria hawass i khamsa 
ke, ya kisi aur tarah se guzre, us ko iasauintr kahte 
hain. Maslan, koi darakht ya patthar ho, jis ke 
wujud ka khiyal ba-zaria hawass i bdsira, yane, dekhne 
se zihn men ata hai, pas us hi patthar ya darakht ke 
khiyal ko, tasauwur kahte hain. 

3. Dusri bdt tasdiq hai. Agar zihn men aise do 
tasauwur hon jin k e bich men nisbat isbdt yd nafi ki 
di jdwe us ko ilm i mantiq men tasdiq kahte hain. 
Masai to maslan ba-zaria hawdss i bdsira ke, ek to yih 
asauwur zihn men dyd, ki yih darakht matijud hai,

act of mind by which we pronounce that " the stone is 
cold" or " the stone is warm " or " the stone is not 
cold " or " the stone is not warm." These conclusions 
when expressed in words are called propositions. 

4. Reasoning is the third state of the mind by 
which, from two or more judgments formed, we pass to 
another or others founded upon or drawn from them. 
For instance, 

" All iron is heavy" is a judgment. 

" This staff is iron" is a second judgment. 

From these two we may draw a third judgment 
or conclusion, viz. "therefore this staff is heavy." The 
act of the mind by which these two judgments are 

compared and the third deduced from them is called 
reasoning. 

Another example of this operation is 
All men are mortal ; 
Zaid and Bakr are men ; 

Therefore Zaid and Bakr are mortal. 

Here also we have in this process the third 
state of the mind with which logic is concerned ei*., 
reasoning. 

5. This book is divided into three parts in which 
the three mental states or processes are treated in 
order. It is the law of thought concerned in them 
which constitutes the subject of logic. 



Meanwhile there are a few mental states needing 
explanation here. By them the materials of thought 
are collected. 

1. Attention is the directing of the mind to an 
object. It may be a voluntary state of the mind. 
Thus we may fix our attention on some object of sight 
or sound or on the matter of a page we may be 
reading.

rlusre ba-zaria usi hawass ke, us ke rang ka tasauwur 
ay a ; pas do tasauwur hue. Ab wuh nisbat i hukmi, 
jo un do tasauwuron men hai tasdiq kahl&ti hai, 
khwah wuh isbat ke sath ho, ya nafi ke sath ho ; jais& 
ki yih " darakht sabz hai " y& " yih sabz nahig. hai." 

Dusri mis&l yih hai, ba-zaria hawass i bdsira ke 
ek patthar ka tasauwur aya, aur ba-zaria hawass i 
l&misa ke, yane, chhune se, sardi ya garmi ka tasauwur 
zihn men guzrd. Ab un donon tasauwuron ke dar- 
miyan men, nisbat i hukmi jo hai, us ko tasdiq kahte 
hain, khwah wuh isbat ho y& nafi ho. Tasdiq bil-isbdt 
ki misal, jaisi ki " yih patthar thandhd hai y& garm 
hai." Tasdiq bil-nafi ki misdl, jaisd ki "yih patthar 
thandha nahin hai, ya garm nahin hai." 

Jab tasdiq likhij&e ya boli jde, tab use qaziya 
kahte hain. Pas tasdiq aur qaziya men sirf itnd farq 
hai, ki tasdiq sirf zihn men thi, aur qaziya jab zaban 
par dyd. 

4. Tisri halat i zihni hujjat hai ; is ko "dalil" aur 
u burhan" bhi kahte hain. Hujjat us ko kahte hain, ki 
do ya kai tasdiqat i maluma se majhul ko nikalen. 
Pas hujjat tasdiq&t se banti hai. 

Masai to maslan do tasdiqat hain, 
Pahli. Kull lohd bhdri hota hai. 
Dusri. Yih danda lohe ka hai. 

Ab in do malum tasdiqon se tisra majhul nikalt& 
hai, ki yih danda bhdri hai. Pas ba-asarfai do tasdiqog 
maluma ke, tisri tasdiq yane natija nikala, Hujjat 
is hi ko kahte hain. 

Dusri misdl. Kull insan marnewale hain ; 

Zaid, Amr, Bakr insdn hain ; 
Pas Zaid, Amr, Bakr, marnewale hain. 

Chunanchi is tartib se atql j& zihn daurdne ka 
hujjat kahte hain.

2. Comparing is the act of the mind in which it 
contemplates two or more things with reference to one 
another. Thus when we observe that iron is heavier 
than wood, or that John is taller than James, or that 
one man is more learned than another, we perform an 
act of comparing. The conclusion we reach from an 
act of comparing is a "judgment." The correctness 
of every judgment and process of reasoning depends 
on the accuracy of comparison. 



3. Abstraction is that act or state of the mind in 
which it considers one or more of the properties or 
circumstances of an object to the exclusion of the rest. 
Thus it is by abstraction that, we think of the shape 
of a piece of iron to the exclusion of its color and 
hardness and weight and odor ; or when we think of 
its hardness to the exclusion of all its other properties. 
The importance of this power of the mind will be seen 
when we come to treat of terms. 

4. Generalization is that process of the mind by 
>viaich we select the common properties of different

qndrati qanun ka bayan hai, jo in tin zihni hdlaton 
men pay a jdtd hai. 



Ab munasib hai ki peshtar un tin zihni halaton 
ke mufassal bayan kame ke chand zihni quwatoij ka 
bayan kiya jde. 

1. Dhydn yd gaur us ko kahte hain, jab zihn 
khauz o fikr ke sdth kisi ohiz ya bdt par lage ; masal to 
maslan, kisi chiz par, jo dekhne mendwe, ya dwaz par jo 
sunne men awe, yd kisi kitabi mudmile par parhte 
waqt hani apna dhyan lagdwe^ yd gaur kareij. 

2. Mnqdbala karnd us zihni qudrat ko kahte 
hain, jis se ham do yd ziydda chizon ko ek dusri se 
muqabala karen. Pas jab ham dekhte hain, ki loha 
lakri se bhari hai, Zaid Amr se lambd hai, yd Zaid 
Amr se ziydda alim hai, isi ko " muqdbila karnd " 
kahte hain. Yahay par gaur karnd chahiye, kimuqabi- 
la karne se tasdiqdt nikalti haiij. Har ek tasdiq aur 
hujjat ki sihat o galati muqabile par munhasar hai ; 
aur agar muqdbila karne men kisi tarah galati par 
jawe, to tasdiq aur hujjat men bhi galati ho jaegi. 

3. Ek aur quwat zihn men hai, jise quwai i 
tafrtqi kahna achchhd hoga. Yih wuhi quv/at hai jab 
ham chahen to kisi ohiz ki aur sab khassiyato^ ko 
chhor kar, us ki ek khassiyat par lihaz karen. Maslan, 
jab ham chahen, to isi qiiwat so lohe ki aur sab sifa- 
ten, yatne, rang aur sakhti, aur wazn, aur bu wg. ko 
chhor kar sirf us ki ek sifat, yane, shakl par lihaz rakh 
sakte hain. Yd alawa aur sab khassiyaton ke, sirf uski 
wkhtt yd waxn par lihdz rakhen. Is quwat i zihni ka 
bard faida age ism ke baydn men malum hoga. 

4. Ek aur quwat zihn men hai, jise quwat i

objects, and by their agreement in these common pro 
perties call them by a common name. Thus the pro- 
cess by which, not withstanding differences and varia- 
tions, certain flowers on account of common properties 
are grouped xmder the name rose, is an act of gen- 
eralization. Again notwithstanding great difference* 
of language, oolor, stature &c. by observing certain 
marked points of resemblance we are able to group the 
human race under the term man. This also is an ac1 
of generalization. It is by this power of mind in con- 
nection with the power of abstraction that we are ena- 
bled to form classes, genera and species, the importance 
of which to logic will be seen hereafter. All the opera- 
tions or states of the mind just described are more or less 
connected with the study and understanding of logic. 

5. This taay be as good a place as any for some 
remarks on language. Man is gifted by the Creator 
with the faculty of speech by which he can express in 
sound all the varied operations, notions and thoughts 
of his mind. Man alone has the faculty of speech. 
Mere animals are capable of uttering certain sounds 
indicative of fear, anger, pain. &c., but they have no 
faculty of speech by which they are capable of using 
a language. But man can employ thousands of words 
or sounds, connected in innumerable ways, to express 
the multiplied thoughts that continually pass through 
his mind. 

Words are the simple or compound sounds ut- 
tered for the expression of feeling or thought.

SECTION I. 

Apprehension. 

1. We take up then for enlarged treatment the 
first mental state viz., apprehension. 

Apprehension is the notion or conception of an 
object in the mind as of a man when seen, of a sound 
when heard, of hardness, coldness &c., when felt. 

2. Apprehension may be inoomplex or complex. 
An incomplex apprehension is the notion simply of 
one object or of several, without any connection being 
perceived between them, as man, tree, stone. A com- 
plex apprehension is the notion we form of two or 
more objects in some relation to, or connection with 
each other, as of a man on horse-back; the man and 
horse forming a complex apprehension : or again, a 
book and stone on the table; where book, stone, and table 
as related together form a complex aprehension. An 
act of apprehension expressed in language is called a 
term or noun which will be now considered.

is tasauwur men ghore aur sawdr ke darmiyan ilaqa

ko tasauwur i murakkab kahte hain. Yad rakhna 
ohdhiye, ki jab tasauwur bold jawe, yane jab us 
ke waste koi lafis muqarrar ho, to us ko juz ya ism 
kahenge. 



SECTION II. 



Of the Term. 

A term then is an act of apprehension expressed 
in language* For instance if we have, by sight, the 
apprehension of a tree in the mind, the word tree by 
which we express this apprehension is a " term." A- 
gain if we have in our mind the idea of sweetness, the 
word sweetness when used to express this notion is a 
"term". There are several divisions of terms which 
we must notice. 

1. Terms are simple of complex. A simple term 
is the name of a single thing and is generally one 
word as tree, sweetness. A complex term is a com- 
pound word or phrase expressing a complex act of ap- 
prehension as a "tall tree", the "sweetness of an orange." 
Here we have two ideas connected in a complex term, 
tall tree. Again the two ideas, sweetness and orange 
give the complex term siveetness of an orange. 

Words are said to be categorematic when they can 
be used alone as terms, as tree, orange, man &c. 
Words that can not be thus used alone but are used 
in connection with other words are called syncategore- 
matic, as tall, siceet, gave, there &c. It must be marked 
that this is a division merely of words as such, not of 
terms. 

2. Another division of terms is into singular 
and common. The singular term is a word or phrase 
used as the particular name of an individual, person 
place, or thing as, John, Calcutta, Kanchinginga. Here 
we have singular terms which are the names of a parti- 
cular person of a particular city and of a particular

Ism ke mufassal bay an men. 

JAB ki tasauwur bazaria lafz ke zdhir ho, us lafz

darakht ki hayat kd tasauwur zihn men dwe, lafz i da- 
rakht ko, jis se us tasauwur ko zahir kiyd, ism kahtc 
hain. Dusri misal, farz karo, ki agar zihn men tasau- 
wur mithas kd dwe, to lafz mithds ism hai. Wdzil 
ho, ki ism kai taqsim par munqasim hai jis kd bayan 
&ge dwega. 

1. Ism mufrad hotd hai yd murakkab. Jab kisi 
tasauwur ke zdhir karne ko ek hi lafz kafi ho, yane ek 
hi lafz us tasauwur par dalalat kare, to us lafz ko ism 
i mufrad kahte hain. Ism i murakkab, murakkab lafis 
yd fiqre ko kahte hain, jis se ek tasauwur i murakkab 
zahir hotd hai, jaisa tinchd darakht, ndrangi ki mithds^ 
wg. Yahdn par do tasauwur ism i murakkab se zahii 
hue, yane tinchd aur darakht, in donon tasauwur- 
on ke zdhir karne ko ism i murakkab tinchd d-arakht 
bold gayd. Dusri misdl mithas, aur narangi^ in donon 
tasauwuron ke zahir karne ko ism i jnurakkab, yaine 
mithi ndrangi bold gayd. 

Q-aur karnd chdhiye, ki lafz bhi do tarah par hotd 
hai, yane tamdm aur nd-tamdm. Lafz tamdm wuh hai, 
jo bild madad dusre ke, apne m$ne batldwe, jaise in- 
san, Zaid, darakht, wg. Lafz nd-iamdm wuh hai, jo 
bild-madad kisi aur lafz ke, apne maine na batldwe. 
Maslan, lafz unchd, mithd, wg. 

2. Ism yd juzt yd kulli hogd. Ism i juzi us ko 
kahte hain, jo kisi khdss shakhs yd shai ko batldwe, 
jaisd Zaid, Kalkatta. Is ko istildh i nahwion men ism 
i marifa, yd alam kahte hain.

mountain, not a name common to every man, city and 
mountain. 

A common term is a word or name that can be 
used for all the individuals of a particular class or collec- 
tion of persons, places, or things as man, city, moun- 
tain. Here the common tertns, man, city, mountain can 
be used for any and every man, city and mountain. 
The individuals for which a common term stands are 
called its "Significates." 

2a *. Terms are again divided into abstract and 
concrete. An abstract term is a word used to express 
quality cr thing without refering to any particular ob- 
ject; thus the words hardness wisdom folly are abstract 
terms when we speak of them without connecting 
them with any particular object as " we should seek 
after wisdom. " 

But if these words become connected with some 
object in which they exist they are called concrete 
terms, as the hardness of a stone, the wisdom of John, 
the/o% of James. In this connection these words 
become "concrete terms." 

3. Terms are also divided into absolute and rela- 
tive. An absolute term is a word denoting some ob- 
ject or quality considered without any reference to its 
relation with any thing else as, tree, man, river, sweet- 
ness, wisdom &c. 

A relative term is a word in which its relation to 

some-thing else is expressed, as father, husband, son, 

king. Thus a father implies a child to whom he is 

related, son implies a father and king implies a coun- 

. try and subjects to whom he is related. 

4. Terms are univocal, equivocal and synonomous. 
A univocal term is one which has invariably the same 
signification as, mankind electrioty wisdom &c. 

* Left out of the Urdu,

Ism i kulli us ko kahte ham, jo bahut si ehizon,

dmm bolte hain. Jitni shai yd ashkhds ism i kulli

3. Ism yd to bin-nisbat yd bild-nisbat hota hai. 
Ism bin-nisbat wuh hai, jis kd aur kisi ism ke sath

shdh. Chunanohi bap se malum hotd hai, ki koi beta 
hai, bete se bdp kd ilaqa pdyd jdta hai ; badshah sa 
nisbat mulk aur rraiyat ki taraf hai, ala-hdz-al-qiyas. 

Ism i bild-nisbat wuh hai, jo bagair nisbat dusre 
ke ek shakhs, yd shai, yd khdssiyat ko batlawe. Mas- 
lan insan, darya, ddndi, wg. 

4. Phir ism tin tarah par hai, yane ism i mush- 
tarak 9 aur g.air-mushtarak 9 jis ko baze mufrad bhi bolte 
hain, aur ism i mutarddif. Ism i mufrad us ko kahte 
hain, jis se sirf ek hi mane samjhe jawen, maslan in- 
san, bijli, ddndi, wg. 



28 

An equivocal term is one that may be employed 
in different senses as, head, door, shore &c. 

Synonomous terms are different words having the 
same meaning as, house and dwelling, remain and a* 
bide &c, 



5. Contradictory terms are those which are so 
completely opposed to each other that the two include 
every thing so that there is no object to which one or 
the other does not apply ; and if any object be includ- 
ed in one it is thereby necessarily excluded from the 
other and vice versa. 

Thus corporeal and incorporeal, perishable and im 
perishable, combatant and noncombatant. These terms 
differ from each other only im respectively wanting and 
having a particle of negation expressed or implied. 
In this way a twofold division may be made of every 
thing. 

Such a division is often important in"a course of 
reasoning oy investigation, For ^instance, this disease 
is or is not consumption Then it is or is not another 
disease. Then it either is or is mot some other disease 
and thus (by the "abscission infinite " as it is called) 
the field of investigation can be aarrowecl till eome 
.result is reaqUed. 

6."*~Gontrary term are opposed i*n a different 
manner from contradictory terms, for although both 
can not J>e applied to t&e same object there may be ob- 
jects to which neither will apply, and 4fcw they do not

include every thing as do contradictory terms. Wise 
and/00//sA, learned and ignorant are contrary terms 
and while both can not be applied to the same object 
there are objects to which neither can be applied. 
Thus a stone is neither wise nor foolish and som 
men may be neither learned nor ignorant but medio- 
cres. Contrary terms then are those which, coming 
under the same claw, are the most widely different of 
all that belong to that class. 

60 * Terms may be compatible or opposite. 

Two terms which can be applied to an object at 
the same time are compatible as, white and cold, hard 
and sweet. It is plain that a thing may be both white 
and cold, as snow, or both hard and sweet, as chrystal 
candy. 

When two terms can not be applied to an object 
at the same time they are opposite, as black and white, 
good and bad. Nothing can be white and black at the 
same time and no man can be good and bad at the 
same time. Opposite and contrary terms are the same. 

These are the divisions of terms ordinarily given 
and are sufficient for the purposes of logic. It should 
be borne in mind that the same term may come under 
different divisions according to the view we take of it. 
Thus the same term may be singular concrete absolute 
and univooal at the same time. The term may thus 
belong to several divisions. The meaning of terms 
should always be understood and fixed in a process 

of reasoning. 

rSimple or complex. 

I Singular or common. 

I Abstract or concrete. 
Terms may be ^ Univocal, equivocal and synonymous. 

I Contradictory. 

I Contrary. 

^Compatible or opposite.

SECTION III. 
Classification. 

Another important subject connected with terms 
and necessary to a proper understanding of logic is 
that of species, genus and differentia* 

1. Common terms obtained by generalization 
afford the means of classification of objects with refer- 
ence to some common and distinguishing characteris- 
tic. A collection containing objects arranged in this 
manner is called a species or genus. Genus is the more 
extensive term, often including many species while 
species includes individuals. For instance the term 
animal is a genus including every thing having life 
and the power of voluntary motion. In this genus 
we have many species included as, man beast 
bird &c., Any species may be divided into several 
classes, then it becomes a genus with reference to this 
new classification. 

Thus above, beast is a species including all warm 
blooded quadrupeds but these may be divided into 
horses sheep dogs &o. 

These then become species and the term " beast/' 
which in the first classification was a species, becomes 
a genus. Again if we divide horses into different 
kinds as Arabian horses mountain horses &o., horse 
itself becomes thus a genus and so on. The more ex- 
tensive class is the genus, the more limited one is the 
species. The genus when included in a higher classifi- 
cation becomes a species. Thus horse, while a genus of 
the different kinds of horses, is a species of quadruped 
which in turn although the genus of horse is a species 
of animal.

to each other : the classes which lie above any class 
that is which embrace a wider extension are called, 
with regard to it superior , while the classes below it 
f *. e. included within it are called inferior. The high- 
est class is called the summum genus or highest genus 
the lowest class is called the lowest species. All be- 
tween the highest genus and the lowest species are 
called subaltern genera or species. The genus next 
above any species is called its proximate genus any 
genus above that, a remote genus of that species. The 
species into which a genus is divided are called coordi- 
nate or cognate species, meaning that they are not sub- 
ordinate to, or included in one another.

ho, us ko pahli jins ki banisbat jins i baid kahte hain. 
Jitne anwa, ki mataht ek jins ke dakhil hain, un ko

Thus we have, 



Classes. 



"Superior class. 
Inferior class. 
Highest genus. 
Lowest species. 



Subaltern genera or species* 
Proximate genus. 
Remote genus. 
^Coordinate or cognate species. 

The meaning of these words should be well fixed 
in the memory. An illustration may aid in the un- 
derstanding of them. 

( Arabian. 
(Horse, I Kdbuli. 
(Mammal. Jg' 'Turkish. 

VFish! 

Here in reference to the class horse, Mammal is sup- 
rior while Arabian is inferior. Of this classification, 
animal is the highest genus, and Arabian &c. are the 
loivest species. Mammal and horse, because between 
these, are called Subaltern. Mammal is the proximate 
genus of horse, and animal a remote genus. Again 
horse, cow, sheep and dog are co-ordinate or cognate 
species. The student may note that " bird," and 

the other words may in like manner be divided into 
genera or species. 

3. Correct classification depends on another sub- 
ject which is called differentia. The differentia of a class 
are its distinguishing characteristics or properties which 
separate it from other classes. Thus if animal be the 
genus including several species of animated beings, one 
of which is man, "speaking" might be fixed on as the 
differentia, and man as a species of animal would be a

speaking animal. Bird is another species of animal 
having feathers and wings. Feathers and wings would 
thus distinguish bird from other species of animal and 
become the differentia. Bird is then a feathered wing- 
ed animal. The species as may be seen is really 
made up of the genus and the differentia. 

4. Property and accident are terms used to denote 
something joined to a species or to individuals of it. 

A property is something joined universally to the 
species, that is, belonging to all the individuals of it. 
The property may be peculiar as belonging only to 
that species, or not peculiar ', as belonging also to some 
other species. Thus breathing and speaking are proper- 
ties of the species man. Of these, breathing is not pecu- 
liar because other species of animals, as horses, dogs, 
&c. breathe, but speaking is peculiar, because belonging 
only to the species man. 

An accident is something joined contingently or 
accidentally to a species or belonging only to certain 
individuals of it, as James is walking James was born 
in Calcutta. Here "walking" and "born in Calcutta" 
are accidents of James, because not necessarily a part 
of James, for he might be lying down or he might 
have been born in any other city. Accidents are sepa- 
rable or inseparable, i. e., they can be separated from the 
individuals or they cannot be thus separated. In the 
above example " walking" is a separable accident, be- 
cause it may be separated from James, so that he may 
be standing, or sitting, or lying down. But " born 
in Calcutta," is an inseparable accident, because what 
thus happened can not now be detached from James.

SECTION IV. 

Definition 

ANOTHER subject connected with terms and hence 
necessary to be understood in a system of logic is 
definition. 

1 . Definition is a metaphorical word which means 
" laying down a boundary." When applied to terms 
in their logical use it means describing them in such a 
manner as to distinguish them from other terms. In 
reasoning, true and settled definitions of terms are 
very important from the fact that different persons 
employ them with different meanings, thus causing 
confusion and error. 

2. "Logicians usually divide a definition into two 
parts which are called the genus and differentia. The 
definition is made by uniting the genus to the differen- 
tia. Thus we may define man to be " an animal gifted 
with speech." Here animal is the genus united to 
" gifted with speech," the differentia by which man is 
distinguished from other animals, as horse, bird, &c. 
Again, the Bombay mango is a mango which came ori- 
ginally from Bombay. Here mango is the genus, and 
Bombay, the differentia distinguishing this mango 
from others. 

3. A common division of definition is into nomi- 
nal and real. A nominal definition merely gives the 
meaning of the term as a name or specifies the object 
to which it is applied. For instance, a telescope is an 
instrument for viewing distant objects. This is the 
definition usually found in dictionaries and is most 
frequently made by the use of synonymous words. A 
real definition is an analysis or explanation of the thing

itself, such as will lead to a knowledge of its construc- 
tion and nature. Thus a real definition of a telescope 
would enter into an explanation o*f its construction 
with some necessary explanation of light. 

There are other divisions of definition but these two 
are perhaps the most useful. It is the office of defini- 
tion in logic to guard against ambiguity and error in 
the use of terms. 

JRules for Definition. 

To aid in this important matter rules have been 
laid down, the most important of which are mentioned 
below. 

First. The definition must be adequate, that is 
neither too extensive nor too limited. For instance as 
a definition of money if one were to say that it is 
" something made of metal", this would be too narrow 
because shells and paper are used and these would be 
excluded by the definition. Or if it were defined as 
" something given in exchange for something else 
needed," this would be too extensive, because includ- 
ing things which are given in exchange which are not 
money. Grain, cloth &c., are thus exchanged. 

Second. The definition itself must be plainer than 
the thing defined otherwise it would not explain its 
meaning. Hence the definition if possible should not 
contain figurative, obscure or metaphorical language. 
These two rules, well observed, will generally make 
terms sufficiently plain to avoid error. 

We pass now to the second division of the subject 
of logic viz., judgment which is made up as we have 
seen of apprehensions. Apprehensions expressed in 
language are terms which are combined to make prn- 
j)o*ition* which are judgments expressed in language. 



Qawdid i Muarrif. 

Muarrif ke banane meg. chand qaide hain, chu- 
nanohi un men se do qaidon ka, jo nihdyat zariir

Pahld. Zaritr ehahiye ki mutirrif tarn ho, jis ko 
baze mantiqin hadd i tdm bolte hain, yane apne kull 
afrad ko jdmo ho, aur gair ke dakhil hone ko mana 
kare. Maslan agar koi naqd ke mane yun batlawe 
ki wuh ek dhdt ki ohiz hai, to yih tarif I jame nahin had, 
kyunki naqd men kaurian bhi dakhil hain, halanki we 
dhat ki nahin hain. Ya agar koi yun bole, ki naqd ek

dakhil hone se mana nahi& karta ; kyunki anaj wg. se 
bhi aur jins kharidi jati hai, pas ab is surat men gair 
afrad bhi is tgrif men d&khil hue jdte hain. Is liye 
yih muarrif tdm na hoga. 

Dfard. Chahiye, ki muatrrif us ohiz se, jis ke 
mane batlata hai saf ho, warna us chiz ki sharah ba- 
khubi zahir na karega. Is waste, agar mumkin ho,

PART II. 

SECTION I. 

The Proposition. 

1. A proposition is an act of judgment expressed 
in language. A proposition as used in logic has also 
been defined, " a sentence indicative." This distin- 
guishes a proposition from a question, a command, an 
entreaty &o., which are not dealt with in logic. 

2. A proposition is formed by combining two or 
more terms, as " the tree is green. " This proposition 
consists of two terms tree and green connected by is. 
Every proposition consist of three parts called the sub- 
ject, the predicate and the copula. 

The subject is that of which something is predicated 
i, e. y affirmed or denied. "The tree is green.'* Here 
tree is the subject of which something is affirmed or 
said, viz. that it is green. 

The copula is the uniting word which shows the 
agreement or disagreement between the subject and the 
predicate. The copula is always some part of the verb 
to be and although this verb may not always be mani- 
fest in the proposition yet it is understood or the pro- 
position can be resolved into such a form as to bring 
it out, showing that this verb is implied. Thus '* the 
Moguls conquered," is equivalent to " the Moguls were 
victorious." From this proposition we see too that the 
verb is sometimes both copula and predicate. Thus in 
the above proposition conquered is equivalent to the co-

pula " ivere" and the predicate "victorious." " The bird 
iiies,"here " flies" is equivalent to a copula " is" and 
a predicate " flying." Sometimes there is an inversion 
111 propositions, as " I hope to see you" equivalent to 
*' to soo you is tlie thing I hope." These peculiari- 
ties of proposition must be kept in mind. 



Divisions of Propositions. 

There are several divisions of propositions which 
must be well understood in order to comprehend suc- 
cessfully the subject of logic. 

1. Propositions are divided into simple and com- 
pouhcf. 



A simple proposition is one whose subject and pre- 
dicate are composed of simple terms i. e. 9 there is in 
it but one subject and one predicate united by the co- 
pula. " Iron is hard, is a simple proposition, having 
but one subject " iron" united by the copula " is" to 
one predicate " hard" 

A compound proposition has two or more subjects or 
two or more predicates i. #., it has more than one term 
either in the subject or predicate of the proposition or 
in both, and it may be resolved into two or more sim- 
ple propositions. Thus "beasts, birds and insects 
have life." In the subject of this proposition 
there are three terms or subjects, beasts, birds and

insects and the proposition, may be resolved thus, 
Beasts have life ; 
Birds have life ; 
Insects have life. 

" Men and angels are rational and accountable be- 
ings." Here both in the subject and predicate there 
are two terms. In the one men and angels and in the 
other rational and accountable. It may be resolved in- 
to two propositions. 

Men are rational and accountable beings ; 
Angels are rational and accountable beings. 

Propositions in which the subject or predicate con- 
tains more than one term,Jbut which can not be resolv- 
ed into simple propositions are sometimes called com- 
plex propositions. Thus "joy and sorrow are opposite 
mental states" is simply a complex propositions, because 
it can not be resolved into single Propositions. Pro- 
positions of this kind must not be taken for compound 
propositions. 

2. Propositions are divided according to their qua- 
lity into affirmative and negative. 

An affirmative proposition is one in which the sub- 
ject and predicate are said to agree as " ice is cold" 
"AisB." 

A negative proposition is one in which the subject 
and predicate are said not to agree as" fire is not cold" 
" A is not B." A proposition is affirmative or negative 
according to its copula i. e., just as the predicate is 
affirmed or denied of the subject. Thus " not to obey 
God is sin" is really an affirmative proposition because 
fin, the predicate, is affirmed of the subject " not to obey 
God" Sometimes in negative propositions the nega- 
tive particle is placed so far from the copula that the 
negative character of the proposition may be overlooked

as " not all the men and angels in the universe can 
cleanse a soul from sin." Here the negative is the 
first word of the proposition, fa.r from the copula can. 
The proposition in the ordinary form would be, "All 
the men and angels in the universe can not cleanse a 
soul from sin." These irregular forms of propositions 
must be understood. It may also be noted that every 
proposition must be either affirmative or negative. 



3. A third division of propositions is according to 
their quantity into universal and particular. 

A universal proposition is one in which the predicate 
is affirmed or denied of the whole of the subject, i. e.> 
agrees or disagrees with the whole of it. In other 
words, the predicate is said of the whole of the subject 
hence the proposition is universal. Thus " all men are 
mortal" is a universal proposition because the predi- 
cate " mortal" is affirmed of the whole of the subject 
" men." Mortal is said not of one man nor of some 
men but of all men. "All A is B." is a universal 
proposition. Again, " no men are trees" is a univer- 
sal proposition because " trees," the predicate, is wholly 
denied of the entire subject, "men" So of "no A is B." 

The signs of universality are all, each, every, no, neither 
and such words as indicate the whole of .the subject. 

"When the sign of universality is not used, or the in- 
definite article is placed before the subject, the univer- 
sal proposition is called indefinite. Thus " sheep are 
quadrupeds" is a universal proposition because it is 
evidently intended to be asserted that " all sheep are 
quadrupeds." lc Liars are sinners," "beasts are not 
accountable" are universals having the signs understood. 

Where the sign of universality is omitted the quan- 
tity of the proposition must be ascertained from its

aur yih bhi yad rakhna chahiye, ki bar qaziya do h61

3. Qaziya kuttiya hoga y&juziya hoga. 

Qaziya i kulliya wuh hai, jis ka mahmul tamam 
fardon ke iqrar ya inkar men awe ; yane mahmul mu- 
w&fiqat ya ndmuwafiqat rakhe tamam mauzu se. Ya is 
tarah par us ka bayan samjho, ki qaziya i kulli meg 
jnahmulkullmauzuparkahdjde. Maslan, "kull insan 
marnewdle hain." Yih qaziya i kulliya hai, is liye ki 
lafz " marnewale" ka jo mahmul hai, kull mauzu ke 
waste, jo " insdn" hai, kaha gaya hai, yaine lafz mar- 
newdle ka sirf ek admi ke waste nahin, balki tamam 
insdn ke waste dy& hai. "Kull A. B. hai." Yih 
qaziya bhi kulliya hai. Ek aur misdldi jati hai. " In- 
sdn darakht nahin hai," yih bhi qaziya i kulliya hai, 
kyunki yahan par lafz darakht ka tamam mauzu, yane 
insan ke inkdr men aya. , Koi A. B. nahin hai." Yih 
bhi qaziya i kulliya hai. Sab, tamdm, har ek, koi na- 
Mn, wg. jo lafz hain, in se qaziye ki kulliyat sabit 
hoti hai. 

Jis qaziya i kulli men glamat kulliyat ki lafzen 
maujud na ho, us ko muhmila kahte hain, maslan, 
" Bheren chaupde hain." Ab yahan par bawujudeki 
aldmat kulliyat ki maujud nahin, phir bhi saf malum

matter. We must determine how it is intended that 
the proposition he taken. A particular proposition is 
one whose suhjeot is taken in only a part of its exten- 
sion i. e.,the predicate is said to agree or disagree with 
only apart of the subject. Thus "some Christians are 
not true followers of Christ" is a particular proposi- 
tion because the predicate " true followers of Christ," 
is denied of " some Christians" the subject, that 
is, does not belong to all who are called Christians. 
The predicate then only belongs to a part of the term 
' ' Christians." Again " many men are brave" " somo 
A is B" are particular propositions because the predi- 
cate " brave" does not belong to all " men" nor the 
predicate " B" to all " A." Thus we see that in par- 
ticular propositions something is said i. e., affirmed or 
denied of only a part of the subject which is then taken 
in only a part of its extension. The sign of a particu- 
lar proposition is some such word as some, few 
several, many &c., indicating that a part only of 
the subject is intended for the predicate. Of that part 
only the predicate is true. 

Some particular propositions are indefinite, that is, 
have not the words, some, few, &c., prefixed to them 
to show that they are limited, Thus " men are poets/* 
" Hindus are idolaters" aj# indefinite propositions, 
because it oan not be intended that "all men are 
poets," nor that *' all Hindus are idolaters" for there .are 
some men who can not write poetry and there are 
Hindus who never worship idols, of which facts all are 
aware. The universal or particular character of such 
propositions must be determined from their intended 
meaning. It is not the business of logic to do this so 
much as to pronounce on the character of the argu- 
jnent in which the proposition* are used after their 
has beea <^6npuwd. Every proposition

ki lafz " bahadur" ka, jo mahmul hai, kull in sail ke 
waste sddiq nahig aya hai, aur isi tarah mahmul " B." - 
kull mauzu " A." par dalalat nahin karta. Graraz ham 
dekhte hain, ki qaziya i juziya men mauzi'i ke baz af- 
rdd par dalilat hoti hai, khwalx bil-isbat ho ya bil-nafi. 

Baz qaziya i juziya bin muhmila hote hain, yane, 
lafz juziyat ke baz, kuchh wg. un men nahin pae jate

kyunki yih raatlab iiahin ho sakta hai, ki tam&m in- 
sftn shair hain; kyunki bahutere admi aise hain, jin 
ko shiar liklina nahin atu, aur Hindiion men bhi aise 
hain, ki butparast nahin hain.

must be either affirmative or negative, also universal 
or particular. Hence with the same subject and pre- 
dicate four different propositions may be formed. Let 
these propositions be distinguished by the vowels 
A. E. I. O. and let x. and y. stand for the subject and 
predicate then we may have. 

A. Universal affirmative ; All x is y. 

E. Universal negative ; No x is y. 

I. Particular affirmative ; Some x is y. 

O. Particular Negative ; Some x is not y. 



4. A fourth division of proposition considered as 
sentences is into Categorical and Hypothetical. 

The categorical unconditionally asserts that the pre- 
dicate does or does not agree with the subject. As 
" man is mortal" " A is not B" which 'are simple un- 
conditional declarations. 

The hypothetical proposition which is compound 
makes it assertion under a condition or alternative. It 
is divided into conditional, disjunctive and causal pro- 
positions. 

A conditional proposition implies a condition as 
" If James return John will go," " If X is Y it is Z." 

A disjunctive proposition implying an alternative is 
formed with the conjunctives either, or, as, " James is 
either a liar or a thief" X is either Y or Z." 

A causal proposition indicates a cause and unites its 
parts by " because. "

Qaziya shartiya i muttasila wuh hai, jis men p&y&

' Causal. 

This fourth division of propoposition will be treated 
of more fully hereafter. For the present we will deal 
only with simple or hypothetical propositions. 

Matter of Proposition. 

This is as good a place as any to explain the matter 
of propositions. By the matter is meant the nature of 
the connection between the terms of a proposition and 
has reference to the truth or falsity of the proposition. 

By observing the nature of the connection of the 
terms we can see that there can be only three kinds of 
matter, viz., necessary, expressed by an affirmative pro- 
position, impossible, expressed by a negative proposition, 
and contingent, expressed by a particular proposition. 
Thus if we have two terms "iron" and "heavy," 
reflection shows us that the truth or the nature of these 
terms makes it necessary for us to connect them affirma- 
tively and we get the affirmative proposition " iron is 
heavy. " 

Again if we have the two terms " sugar" and " sour' 1 
and wish to connect them in a true proposition it is 
impossible to do it affirmatively and hence we get the 
negative proposition " sugar is not sour" 

Again if we have the two terms " men" and "learn- 
ed" we see that they cannot be truthfully connected 
in a universal proposition either affirmatively or nega- 
tively but they have a contingent relation i, e. 9 only 
aad under oeytaia circumstances men are

learned, hence we must connect these terms in a par- 
ticular proposition, " some men are learned." 

Thus from the matter of propositions throe rules are 
formed, the correctness of which will be manifest on 
reflection. " 



1. In necessary matter all affirmatives are true and 
negatives false. 

2. In impossible matter all negatives are true and 
affirmatives are false. 

3. In contingent matter all particulars are true 
and universals false. 

The importance of understanding this point in the 
consideration of propositions will be more fully seen 
when we come to treat of "opposition of propositions." 

The student should fix well in mind the following :

SECTION II. 
Distribution of Terms. 

1 . The distribution of terms is an important matter 
connected with propositions. Terms, as has been seen, 
are found in the subject and predicate of propositions. 
The terms of a proposition are said to be distributed, 
when they include or relate to every thing that can be 
referred to by them. A term then is " distributed " 
when it is used universally, that is, when it stands for 
or includes all its significates and " non-distributed " 
when it is particular, that is, stands for but a part of its 
significates. 

Thus in the proposition "All men are mortal "the 
subject "all men" is distributed because the whole 
of it is taken as affected by the quality of mortality. 
On the other hand the predicate " mortal " of this 
proposition is undistributed because, as used in this 
proposition, it is manifest that but a part of the 
extension of the term is used, viz. that which includes 
or covers man, there being many other creatures be- 
sides man for which the term could be used, but here 
it is confined to man i. e. it is not distributed. 

2. Without fully understanding the distribution 
of terms, but little use can be made of the study of logic, 
hence we proceed to present clearly the principles on 
which it depends. Both the subject and predicate of a 
proposition must always be either distributed or non- 
distributed. 

The distribution of the subject of a proposition 
depends on its quantity i. e. on its being universal or 
particular while the distribution of the predicate de- 
pendg on the quality of proposition t. e. on its being

affirmative or negative. The truth of these statements 
will appear from some illustrations. 

Only four kinds of categorical propositions can be 
formed, viz., 

Universal affirmative. .(A) All X is Y. 
Universal negative , . (E) No X is Y. 
Particular affirmative. .(I) Some X is Y. 
Particular negative . . (O ) Some X is not Y. 

These may be represented by geometrical notations

Inspection of these propositions, first with regard to 
the subject will show that in the universal proposition 
the subject is distributed, that it is taken in its fullest 
extension including all its significatcs. This is indicat- 
ed by the prefixes all and no and a glance at the 
geometrical figure shows the truth of this statement to 
the eye. Hence the rule 

1. All universal propositions distribute the subject. 

An examination further of these propositions shows 
that in the particulars the subject is not distributed i. e. 
a part only of the term is taken as is indicated by the 
prefix some and is made plain to the eye by the 
geometrical figures, only a part of Xbeing included in Y

Hence the rule 

2. No particular propositions distribute the subject. 

Thus it is seen that the distribution of the subject 
depends on the quantity of the proposition. 

Again if we examine the four categorical proposi- 
tions with reference to the predicate we will see that its 
distribution is by no means implied in the distri- 
bution of the subject and that it depends on the 
quality of the proposition i. c. its being affirmative or 
negative. 

If it is asserted (in a universal affirmative proposi- 
tion) that "all men are mortal " or all X is Y " it is 
not asserted that other things besides X are not Y. 

Other beings beside men may be mortal and other 
things besides X may be included in Y, 

as seen by this figure. Hence 
it is evident that the whole 




of the predicate "mortal" or 
" Y" is not considered. 

Again if we make these propositions particular 
thus "some men are mortal" " some X is Y," it will 
still be seen that only a part of "mortal" and "Y" is 
distributed. A part or all of other 

things besides X may be included 
inY, thus: Hence whether univer- 
sal or particular we get the rule : 



3. No affirmative proposition distributes the predicate. 
If we turn now to negative propositions we see that 
whether universal or particular the predicate is always 
distributed.

Thus in the universal negative "no men are birds/' 
"no X is Y." it is plain that we 
must consider i. e. distribute the nf 
whole of the predicate "birds, 
before we can affirm that there are no men in it, and the 
whole of Y before we can assert that no X is included 
in it. Hence in the universal negative the predicate is 
distributed. So also of the particular negative, for if it 
be asserted that "someX is not Y," 
it is plain that the whole of the 
predicate " Y" must be passed in/ 
review or examined, that is <Jia-\ 
tribittedy before the statement can 
be truthfully made that Y does 
not belong to the part of X under consideration. 
Hence for all negatives we get the rule : 

4. All negative propositions distribute the predicate. 

Thus it is seen that the distribution of the predicate 
depends on the quality of the proposition. All these 
facts should be kept well in mind. The rules for dis- 
tribution, collected together, are as follows : 

1. All universal proposition distributes the subject. 

2. No particular propositions distribute the subject. 

3. No affirmative proposition distributes the predicate. 

4. All negative propositions distribute the predicate. 

The importance of this point in propositions will 
be more fully seen in part third of this book.

SECTION III. 

Conversion. 

The conversion of a proposition consists in trans- 
posing its terms so as to place the subject for the pre- 
dicate and the predicate for the subject. 

Thus the proposition " no men are angels" may 
have the subject and predicate transposed and become 
"no angels are inen" "Some men are good" "some 
good (beings) are men" is likewise converted. The 
proposition to be converted is called the exposita that 
into which it is changed is called the converse. 

Conversion is only allowable when the truth of the 
converse is implied by the truth of the esposita. Such 
is called the "illative" conversion, and is the one used 
in logic. Any thing else would be only an apparent 
not a real conversion. It is often useful in an argu- 
ment or in detecting an error to thus transpose the sub- 
ject and predicate of a proposition. 

There are three kinds of conversion by one or 
the other of which every proposition may be converted. 

1. When the subject is simply made the predicate, 
and the predicate the subject without any further 
change it is called simple conversion, as 
" No good man is a rebel." 
Converse. " No rebel is a good man." 

" Some bad men are learned." 
Converse. " Some learned men are bad." 

"NoXisY." 
"No Y is X." ( Y

Koi B. A, nahin hai." 





70 

Universal negatives and particular affirmatives arc 
converted in this way. 

2. But by an examination of the four categorical 
propositions it will be seen that they cannot all be 
transposed by simple conversion. Thus take the uni- 
versal affirmative: 

" All horses are quadrupeds," and the simple con- 
terse, " all quadrupeds are horses " is not true, for 
there are many four legged animals that are not horses. 
Thus also "all X is Y " cannot be con- 
verted to " all Y is X." Hence in or- 
der to preserve a true proposition in 
the converse of universal affirma- 
tive we must make it a particular, thus 
the converse of the above should be 

"Some quadrupeds are horses. 51 
"SomeYisX," 

and it becomes true enough. Thus the converse of a 
universal affirmative must be a particular affirmative. 
The quantity of the proposition is changed. This is 
called conversion by limitation. All universals are 
converted in this way. 

3. By an examination of a particular negative it 
will be seen that its subject and predicate can be trans- 
posed neither by simple conversion nor by limitation 
as in the last example. Here then is a peculiar dif- 
ficulty. We can eay 

" Some quadrupeds are not horses/' 
But we cannot convert this simply and say 

" Some horses are not quadrupeds," 
for this would not be illative conversion and the pro- 
position would not be true. Nor does it make truth 
to convert the particular into a universal and say 

" All horses are not quadrupeds." 
Still this particular negative can be converted by a 
peculiar process. If we detach the negative particle

ki bahut chauppae ghore nahin

72 

from the copula and attach it to the predicate, the 
proposition really becomes a particular affirmative and 
may readily be converted by limitation thus, 

"Some quadrupeds are (not-horses". ) 

"Some X is (not-T ".) 

Here we have changed the quality of the proposi- 
tion and have really a particular affirmative with the 
term " not-horses" for its predicate which may then 
be converted by limitation thus 

"Some (not-horses) are quadrupeds" 
or plainly expressed, 

"Some animals (not-horses) are quadrupeds," 
which is true enough. Thus also 

"Some men are not poets," 

"Some not poets are men." 
This is called conversion by negation. 
4. Thus there are three regular kinds of conver- 
sion by means of which every proposition may be con- 
verted. An examination of thejprocess of conversion 
shows that a term undistributed in the exposita re- 
mains undistributed in the converse. The predicate of 
the affirmative proposition "all horses ]are quadrupeds" 
is undistributed because no affirmative distributes 
the predicate. Hence when we convert illatively and 
the predicate becomes the subject it must be undistri- 
buted and we get "some quadrupeds are horses." 

So of every proposition and we get the rule for 
conversion 

No term must bo distributed in the converse that was 
undistributed in the cxposita. 

!1 Simple conversion. 
2 Conversion by limitation. 
3 Conversion by negation or 
contraposition.

us ko mahmul kd ek juz kar den, to is surat men qaziya i

Ab harf i nafi ko nisbat i hukmiya se alag karke 
mahmul kd juz bandnd chahiye, yane 

" Baz chaupae na-ghore (yane gair-ghore) hain.' 

Is kd aks yun hogd, ki 

' Baz gair-ghore chanpde hain," 

yane, baz jdnwar jo ghore nahin hain, ehaupae hain. 
DAsri misal is ki, 

" Baz admi shdir nahin," is ka aks yun na hoga, 
ki " Baz shair adnii nahin hain." 

Lekin agar harf i nafi, mahmul ka ek juz ho jae, 
phir usi surat men us ka aks ho jaega, jaisa ki 
" Baz gair-shdir admi hain."

Ciaziye ke aks karne ke tariqe jo hain, un par 
agar gaur kiya jawe, to malum hota hai, ki mauzu 
o mahmul i juzi, bad aks ke bhi juzi rahta hai. 

Maslan, " Sab ghore chaupfie hain." 
Is ka mahmul " chaupde" jo hai, juzi hai, kis wfis- 
te ki kisi qaziya i mujiba kd mahmul kulliya hota 
hi nahin, juziya hota hai. Pas agar aks kiya jdwe, 
to yun hoga, 

" Baz ehaupae ghore hain," 
aur dmm qdida yih thahrd, ki 

Jo mauzu yd mahmul ki juzi hai, bad aks ke bhi

SECTION IV. 



Opposition. 

I. Opposition in propositions is the relation be- 
tween any two which having the same subject and pre- 
dicate differ in quantity or quality or both. Thus 

One may deny in whole or in part what the other 
affirms. 



AllXisY,opposedl> y j J^iot Y. 



One may affirm in whole or in part what the other 
denies 



No X is T, opposed by 

One may 'affirm in whole what the other affirms 
in part. 

All X is Y, opposed by Some X is Y. 
One may deny in whole what the other denies in 
part. 

No X is Y, opposed by Some X is not Y. 
Now as there are four forms of categorical propo- 
sitions, universal, particular, affirmative, negative, and 
any two of these may be opposed, it is plain that there 
are four kinds of opposition as is seen in the above 
statement with the same subject and predicate. 

If two universal propositions differ in quality only, 
they are called contraries, 

( Every X is Y. 
as ( No X is Y. 

If two particular propositions differ in quality only 
they are called subcontraries, 

( Some X is Y. 
as ( Some X is not Y. 

If two propositions agree in quality, but differ in

quantity, they are not actually opposed to each other and 
are called subalterns, 

(Every X is Y. m (No X is Y. 

as ( Some X is Y. or \ Some X is not Y. 

If two propositions differ both in quality and 
quantity they are called contradictories 

( Every X is Y. , ( No X is Y. 

as i Some X is not Y. ancl ( Some X is Y. 

Or to state this matter in another way : 
The universal affirmatives opposed to universal 
-negatives are contraries. 

The two particulars opposed are subcontrarics. 

The two affirmatives or the two negatives opposed 
are, subalterns. 

Two projositions opposed both in quality and 
quantity are contradictories. 

The four kinds of opposition may be illustrated 
by a figure thus, 

All men are mortal. A contraries E. No men arc mortal 



- 



2 A *. 

5S 5 <o 

c. 



Some men arc mortal. I subcontraries 0. Some men are not mortal. 
2. By recollecting now what was said on the 
truth or falsify of propositions under the head o 
matter, an inspection of this scheme shows that, 
If ono contrary is true the other must be false, but 
If ono contrary is fake the other may be false also.

magar kulliyat o juziyat men mutanaqiz hon. Magar 
aisi naqiz, haldnki haqiqi nahin hai, phir bhi ek tarah

78 

If one subcontraryis false the other must bo true, but 

If one subcontract/ is true the other may be true also. 

If in subalterns the universal is true the particular 
must be true. 

But in subalterns if the particular be true the uni- 
versal may or may not be true. 

If in subalterns the particular is false the universal 
must be also. 

If one contradictory is true or false the other must 
be just the opposite. 

This may be summed up in three rules thus 

Contraries may both be false, but never both true. 

Subcoutraries may both be true, but never both false. 

Of contradictories if one be false the other must bo 
true and rice versa. 

These points in regard to opposition should bo 
well kept in mind. In logic we may thus learn how 
far the truth or falsity of one proposition may be in- 
ferred from the truth or falsity of an other. 



Recapitulation. 

3. Having thus gone over the second great di- 
vision of logic it may be well to collect what has been 
said on propositions in a tabular form to be memorized. 

A proposition is an act ofjudcpnent expressed in words. 
A proposition consists of three parts, the subject 
the copula and the predicate.

2. In imposible matter all negatives are true and 
affirmatives false. 

3. In contingent matter all particulars are true 
and universals false. 

The terms L c. the subject and predicate of propo- 
sitions are distributed when they are taken universally, 
non-distributed when only taken in part. 

Rules for Distribution. 

1. All universal propositions distribute the sub- 
ject. 

2. No particular proposition distributes the sub- 
ject. 

3. All negative propositions distribute the pre- 
dicate. 

4. No affirmative proposition distributes the pre- 
dicate. 

The conversion of a proposition consists in trans- 
posing its terms so that the subject becomes the pre- 
dicate and the predicate the subject. 

The original proposition is called the exposita the 
new one formed from it the converse. 

Only illative conversion is allowable i. e. where 
the truth of the converse is implied by the truth of the 
expo sit a.

Rule for conversion. 

No term must be distributed in the converse that was 
undistributed in the exposita. 

Propositions are opposed when having the same 
subject and predicate they differ in quality or quantity 
or both. 

Opposition j& of four kinds. 

1. Two universal propositions differing only in 
quality are contraries. 

2. Two particular propositions differing only in 
quality are subcontraries. 

3. Two propositions agreeing in quality, but dif- 
fering in quantity are subalterns. 

4. Two propositions differing both in quantity 
and quality are contradictories. 

Rules for Opposition. 

1. Contraries may both be false, but never both 
true. 

2. Subcontraries may both be true, but never 
both false. 

3. Of contradictories if one be false the other 
must be true and vice versa. 

We now proceed to part III. where propositions 
are gathered into arguments thus completing the sub- 
ject of logic.

PART III. 



SECTION I. 

Arguments. 

1. The third operation of the mind with which 
logic is concerned is reasoning. An act of reasoning 
expressed in words is called an argument. Kvery ar- 
gument consists of two parts, the point to be proven 
and that by which it is proven. 

The part to be proven is called the conclusion and 
that by which it is proven the premisses. 

In the logical order, the premises are stated first, 
and after them the conclusion, connected by the illative 
conjunction therefore. Thus an argument: 

Whatever exhibits marks of design must have an 
intelligent author. 

The world in which we live, exhibits marks of 
design. 

Therefore the world must have an intelligent 
author. 

Here the first two lines are the premisses in an 
argument proving that the world has an intelligent 
Creator. The line beginning with therefore is the 
conclusion. 

A.n argument then is on expression of reasoning in 
which from something laid down and granted as true e. i. 
the premisses, something else beyond this, viz., the conclu- 
sion , necessarily folloivs and must be admitted as true. 

The two parts of an argument then are made up 
of propositions. The propositions in the first part cal- 
led the premisses are, as has been seen, admitted to bo 
true and from them another proposition or proposi-

tions are drawn which is the conclusion or second part 
of the argument. 

Now logic teaches us to draw from known or ad- 
mitted propositions true conclusions. 

2. An argument stated In its fall, regular, logical 
form is called a syllogism. 

In the syllogism the conclusion follows from the 
mere force of the expression or arrangement of the 
propositions, without considering the meaning of the 
terms. 

Thus, All X is Y. 

Z isX. 

Therefore Z is Y. 

It is manifest that the conclusion must follow 
whatever the terms X, Y and Z may stand for i. c. 
the conclusion follows from the mere force of the ex- 
pression as may be seen by a geometrical figure. 

All X is contained in Y. 

Z is contained in X. 

Therefore Z is contained in Y. 

Or to express the same thing in plain propositions. 
All men are mortal. 
Zaid, Amr, Bakr are men . 
Therefore Zaid, Amr, Bakr are mortal. 



3. Every syllogism then consists of three and 
only three propositions. The first two of which are 
called the premisses and the last which follows from 
them is called the conclusion. The first proposition in 
the syllogism is~called the major premiss and the second 
is called the minor premiss. Every proposition, as was 
seen, contains two terms, called ^ subject and predicate.

88 



Now let it be kept in mind that every syllogism con- 
tains three and only three terms called the major term, 
minor term and the middle term. The major term is 
so-oallel because found in the major premiss, the minor 
term because found in the minor premiss. The middle 
term, which is found in both premisses, is so-called be- 
cause it comes, as it were, between the other two and is 
the medium of comparison between them. Having 
been thus compared with it they are declared to agree 
or disagree in the conclusion which thus contains botli 
the major and minor terms. Thus the syllogism is the 
comparison of two notions or terms with a third notion 
or term to ascertain whether they agree or not. Sup- 
pose the question is whether a certain thing is poison- 
ous or not. In order to ascertain the agreement of the 
term poisonous, and the thing before us, we compare it 
with a third thing, arsenic, which we know to be poison- 
ous, and find that it contains arsenic, hence we may 
say that it is poisonous. The syllogism for this would 
be, 

Arsenic is poisonous. 

This thing is arsenic. 

Therefore it is poisonous. 

The minor term is always the subject of the con- 
clusion and the major term the predicate. 

4. A few examples of syllogisms are subjoined 
and analyzed for practice in the form and elements of 
the syllogism. 

Syllogism. 

Every desire to gain by another's loss, is sin. 

All gaming is a desire to gain by another's loss. 

Therefore all gaming is sin. 
Here are three propositions; the first is the major 
premiss, the second the minor premiss, and the last the 
conclusion. Each proposition has its subject and pre-

dioate connected by a copula. In'the first proposition, 
or major premiss, the subject is " every desire to gain by 
another'* loss," the predicate is " tin" In the second 
proposition, called the minor premiss, the subject is 
" all gaming " and the predicate is *'a desire to gain by 
another's loss." In the last proposition called the con- 
clusion " all gaming " is the subject and " sin " is the 
predicate. By observing it will be seen that the syl- 
logism really contains only three terms i. e. 9 " desire 
to gain by another's loss", "sin; "and "gaming." "De- 
sire to gain by another's loss" is the middle term, 
being that with which the other two terms are compar- 
ed. " Sin " in the major premiss is the major term 
and " gaming " in the minor premiss is the minor 
term. As always must be the case " gaming ", the 
minor term, is the subject of the conclusion and "sin", 
the major term, is its predicate. 

Syllogism. 

All murderers deserve death. 

N&nd sdhib was a murderer. 

Therefore Nana sahib deserved death. 
Here are three propositions, the two first are pre- 
misses, the major and minor, the last is the conclusion. 
Each proposition has its subject and predicate, yet 
there are only three terms in the syllogism; first, the 
middle term "murderer : " second, the major term "deserve 
death" and third, the minor term "Ndndsdhib." The 
minor and major term are the subject and predicate of 

the conclusion. 

Syllogism, 

Avarice is a sin. 
Sin leads to hell. 
Avarice leads to hell. 

"Sin" is the middle term, " avarice" is the minor 
term, " leads to hell" is the major term.

Syllogism. 

Middle term. 
livery (doctrine tending to bring dishonor on God) 

Major term. 
(should bo rejected.) 

Minor term. Middle tcr.n. 

Ti:e (doctrine of fate,) (tends to bring dishonor on God.) 

Minor term. Major term. 

Therefore the (doctrine of fate) (should be rejected.) 

5. Let it bo remembered that every valid argu- 
ment may be reduced to a syllogism. It is not necessary 
that every argument be stated in this form in full, but 
if an argument is correct it may be put into this form. 
Thus if one should deny that the world has an intelli- 
gent Creator, one claiming that it has, would bring 
forth a number of facts to prove that the world is full 
of design, and the proof would be considered valid and 
the argument good although one point is left out, 
namely that whatever contains design has an intelligent 
Creator. Now this argument stated in full and reduced 
to a syllogism would be 

"Whatsoever contains design has an intelli- 
gent Creator. 

The world contains design. 
Therefore the world has an intelligent Creator. 
The syllogism then is a kind of touch-stone that 
may be applied to all arguments to test their quality 
of truth or falsity. Or it may be represented as a 
straight edge which, applied to argument?, shows them 
to be straight and truthful or crooked and erroneous. 

6. The syllogism is founded on what is called 
Aristotle 9 s dictum. The dictum is 

Whatever is predicated of a universal term or class 
may be predicated of any or all tiring* contained? in that 
term or claw.

This may be stated more at length thus. If we 
predicate *'. c. affirm or deny that something belongs 
to any term or class and then show that something 
comes under that term or class, we may likewise pre- 
dicate i c. affirm or deny of it what is affirmed or 
denied of the term or class. Thus if we show 
(predicate) that, All X is contained 
in Y and then show (predicate) that 
Z is contained in X> we may pre- 
dicate that Z is contained in Y , 
as seen in the figure. 

Hence whatever is predicated of a term or class 
may be predicated of every thing in that term. All 
correct reasoning is based on this principle which is 
thus a fate of thought. Nothing can be more simple 
and plain than this law. If we affirm or deny some- 
thing of an entire class of things and then prove or as- 
sert that a certain thing comes under this class we 
may justly affirm or deny the same of it. The term 
or class here spoken of is the " middle term " of the 
syllogism. 

Logical Axioms and Rules for the Syllogism. 

7. Every correct syllogism agrees with certain 
rules. It was stated that every syllogism contains 
three and only three terms, the major the minor and 
middle with which the major and minor are compared. 

Axioms. 

1. If two terms agree with one and the same third 
they agree ivith one another. 

2. If one term agrees with and another disagrees 
with the same third these tico disagree with one another. 

The third term of these axioms is the middle term . 
in a syllogism. 

Prom these two axioms several rules are drawn 
for testing the validity of syllogisms.

Rule. 

1. If both premisses of a syllogism are affirmative 
the conclusion must be affirmative. 

This comes from the first axiom, because if the major 
premiss be affirmative i. e. expresses the agreement of 
the major term with the middle, and the minor premiss also 
be affirmative, expressing the agreement of the minor 
term with the middle, it is plain that the conclusion in 
which these two terms are compared with each other 
must be affirmative i. e. express their argreement with 
each other because they were affirmed to agree each 
with the same third or middle term. Thus if we 
affirm that "All intelligent beings were made to serve 
God" (major premiss) and also we affirm "Angels 
are intelligent beings." We must affirm in the conclu- 
sion that "Angels were made to serve God." 

Here the two terms "serve God " and " angelaT 1 
were found to agree with the same third *. c. "intelli- 
gent beings " hence they wore declared to agree in the 
conclusion. 

Rule. 

2. If one of the premisses be affirmative and the 
other negative the conclusion must be negative. 
This comes from the second axiom. 
It is plain that if a term in one of the propositions 
agrees with i. e. is affirmed of the middle term, and a 
term in another proposition disagrees with i. e. is 
denied of the middle term, the two not agreeing with 
the^ same, cannot agree with each other, hence a 
negative conclusion follows. Thus 
Good men go to heaven. 
Lia*s are not good men. 
Therefore liars do not ga to heaven, 
the major premiss- is affirmative i. e. the

major term " go to heaven " agrees with the middle 
term "good men/' 

The minor premiss is negative i. c. the minor 
term " liars " is denied of the middle term and hence 
these two terms disagree and the conclusion is nega- 
tive " Liars do not go to heaven." 

Rule. 

o. If both premisses be negatives we can draw no 
condition. Thus 

" Zaid is not a diligent student." 

" Amr is not a diligent student," proves nothing. 

XisnotY 

KisnotY 

No relation is established. 

It is nothing to the point to say " Zaid is not 
Amr," for although it is true enough ; this does not 
follow from the premisses, but is simply a fact, 
not sustained by these two proposition. The reason 
of this is, the syllogism is a form of expression 
in which two terms are compared with each other by 
means of a middle term; now, at least one of the 
terms must agree with the middle term or standard of 
comparison, or no comparison can be effected between 
them. We are supposed to be trying to find some 
relation between these terms but we can draw no com- 
parision between them unless at least one of them 
agrees with the thing by which we propose to measure 
or compare them. Thus if we have before us two 
large stones and wish to compare them and say what 
their weight is with reference to each other, we can 
conclude nothing about them by having a weight put 
iuto our hand by which neither of them can be weighed

i. e. with which neither of them agree. Thus also if 
we say 

Zaid is not a diligent student. 

Amr is not a diligent student. 
We have learned nothing about Zaid and Amr 
as compared with each other, or in other words we have 
failed to establish any relation between them. But if 
we make one of the premisses affirmative and say, 

Zaid is not a diligent student. 

A good boy is a diligent student. 
Wo can compare Zaid with good boy and draw the 
conclusion 

Zaid is not a good boy. 

The conclusion thus states the relation between 
the major and minor term, found out when both or one 
of them agrees with the middle, the term ofcompari- 
sion. 

Rule. 

4, The middle term must be univocal i. e. have l>nt 
one meaning in the premisses. 

The reason is that in the syllogism a comparison 
is effected between two terms by means of a third ; the 
syllogism then as has been stated must have only 
three terms. But in any syllogism, if the middle 
term is ambiguous i. e. has one meaning in the major 
premiss and an other meaning in the minor premiss, 
there are in reality two middle terms, or four terms in 
the syllogism. To draw a conclusion from such pre- 
misses would be like comparing the length of two 
staffs, having measured one with a false and one with 
a true measure, or like comparing the weight of two 
stones having weighed one with a false and the other 
with a true weight.

The following is an example of an ambiguous 

middle. 

Light is contrary to darkness. 

Feathers are light. 

Therefore feathers are contrary to darkness. 
Here the >vord "light" i^ used in two senses. 
This plain example is given simply as an illustra- 
tion of the ambiguous middle. No one could be mis- 
led by such glaring errors, but in many cases of error 
the ambiguous middle is not so manifest. For instance, 
Christians and Mohammedans, in arguing about the 
Trinity attach different meanings to that word. Mo- 
hammedans argue that Christians teach a plurality of 
Gods and hence they are blasphemers. Their argu- 
ment thrown into the form of a syllogism would run 
thus 

The doctrine of the Trinity implies a plurality 
of Gods. 

Christians hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. 
Therefore Christians hold to a plurality of Gk>ds. 
Here the middle term " doctrine of the Trinity " 
is ambiguous. As urged by the Mohammedans in the 
major premiss it means one thing and as held by the 
Christians in the minor premiss it means another 
thing. 

The same ambiguity sometimes occurs in the word 
faith. Christians argue that faith in God is pleasing 
to him and insures salvation. Hindus urge that they 
have faith in God and therefore will obtain salvation. 
Their claim put in the form of a syllogism would run 
thus 

Faith in God procures salvation. 
Hindus have faith in God. 
Therefore Hindus procure salvation. 
Here the middle term " faith in God " is ambigu- 
ous ; for, as used by Chris tians, it includes more than as

used by the Hindus. As used by one, it means a pro- 
per conception of God's character, trust in him, obe- 
dience to him, by the other it means simply a belief 
in the existence of one Grod. The meaning of the 
middle term then should be fixed i. e. it should have 
but one meaning in a syllogism* 

Rule. 

5 The middle term must be distributed at leant 
once m the premisses. 

The reason of this is, if the middle term bo not 
distributed at least once in one of the premisses it does 
not become a reliable medium of comparison between 
the major and minor terms ; for if the middle term bo 
not distributed at least once i. e. if one of the terms be 
not compared with the whole of it, it might happen 
that the major term was compared with one part of the 
middle and the minor term w*th a totally different 
part of it. There would thus really be two middle 
terms i. e. the major and minor terms would not be 
compared with the same thing. Hence the syllogism 
would have in reality four terms. 

This will be plain from a figure. 



Somo X is Y 
Some X is Z 
Therefore some Z is Y

Here X is not distributed as is seen from the sign 
"some" and from the figure it 
is plain that the conclusion does 
not follow although it might 
happen that some Z is Y, thus 

The following is a syllogism of this kind. 

Some animals are sheep. 
Some animals are horses. 
Therefore some horses are sheep. 
Or, White is a color. 
Black is a color. 
Therefore black is white. 

It is manifest that the middle term "color" is 
only taken 'in part in both premisses, hence the error 
in the conclusion. The middle term then must be 
distributed at least once. 

Aristotle's dictum also requires that in a syllo- 
gism the predicate be of & whole class .i e. of the middle 
term. 

Rule. 

6. A term must not be distributed in the conclu- 
sion that was not distributed in its premiss. 

The reason is that if a term be distributed i. e. 
taken entirely in the conclusion which was undistri- 
buted or taken but in part in the piemisses, things 
would be compared in the conclusion which were not 
compared in the premisses, and in reality a fourth 
term would be introduced into the syllogism while 
three is the rule. We can only compare that part of 
a term with another in the conclusion that was com- 
pared with the middle term in the premisses, but if 
only a part of a term be compared in the premiss, and 
then the whole of it be compared in the conclusion,

Sabab is ka yih hai, ki agar akbar yd asgar natije

hoga, ki baz afrad, jo kubra aur sugra men muqabila 
karne ko rah gae the, natije men akar muqabila kiye

something would be introduced that had not been 
compared before. 

A figure will make this error plain. 



All X is Y. 

No Z is X. 
Therefore no Z is Y.' 
Not true. 




Or 



I All X is Y. 
J All X is Z. 



Therefore all Z is Y. 
Not true. 



I 




In the first of these examples Y the major term 
is not distributed in its premiss because the predicate 
of an affirmative proposition i. e> a part of Y is taken, 
as much as is included in X. But in the conclusion 
Y is distributed because the predicate of a negative 
proposition i. e. the whole of Y is taken and hence the 
mistake of saying that no part of Z corresponds 
with Y. 

In the second of these examples the minor term 
Z is not distributed i. e. is taken but in part, because 
the predicate of an affirmative proposition ; but in the 
conclusion being the subject of a universal it is distri- 
buted ; hence the error. 

The first example is the same as saying, 
All quadrupeds are animals. 
No bird is a quadruped. 
Therefore no bird is an animal*

sabab se, ki mahmul para hai qaziya i mujibo ka, yane 
jitna hissa B. kd A. men dakhil hai, utna hi lo liya

Pahli misal men aisi galati hai, goya koi kahe, ki 

Sab chaup&e haiwfin hain. 
Koi parand ehaupdya nahin hai. 
Pas koi parand haiwan nahin hain. 




110 

The second example is, 

All men are sinners. 

All men are animate beings. 

Therefore all animate beings are sinners, 
neither of which can be true. If the major term be 
unduly distributed it is called " illicit process " of the 
major, if the minor be unduly distributed it is called 
" illicit process " of the minor. 

Rule. 

7. If both premisses are particulars no conclusion 
can be draivn. 

This rule grows out of rules 5th and 6th. The 
reason is plain. We are left without any medium of 
comparison. Thus a conclusion from particular pre- 
misses would be either a case of "undistributed middle" 
or "illicit process ." For instance to say, 

Some men are wise. 

Some men are foolish, proves nothing, for we 
have an undistributed middle and are not justifi ed 
in saying, 

Therefore foolish persons are wise. 
This is the same as to say 

Some X is Y. _ ^ -^^ 
Some X is Z. ( y Q A z J ictlive. 
Therefore some Z is Y. ^ XX X 

Again if we make one of the premisses negative 
and say, 

Some animals are sagacious. 

Some quadrupeds are not sagacious, we would 
have an " illicit process " to infer that 

Some quadrupeds are not animals.

The same as to say 
Some X is Y. 
Some Z is not Y. 
Therefore some Z is not X. 

These seven rules are for testing the validity of a 
syllogism. If they are violated by any syllogism we 
may be sure that it involves an error. Although we 
can not point it out clearly at the time, the syllogism 
may be rejected as faulty. We may not always be 
able to demonstrate the truth of each rule, just as one 
may forget the proof of a rule in arithmetic, but the 
rules should be well . committed to memory for ready 
use in testing every syllogism. 

Recapitulation. 

Every syllogism contains three and only three 
propositions called the 

1 Major premiss. 

2 Minor premiss. 

3 Conclusion. 

Every syllogism contains three and only three 
terms, the 

1 Major. 

2 Minor. 

3 Middle. 



1 . If two terms agree with one and the same third 
they agree with one another. 

2. If one term agrees with and another term 
disagrees with the same third, these two will disagree 
with one another.

Rules for Syllogism. 

1. If both premisses of a syllogism are affirma- 
tive the conclusion must be affirmative. 

2. If one of the premisses be affirmative and the 
other negative the conclusion must be negative. 

3. If both premisses be negative we can draw 
no conclusion. 

4. The middle term must be univocal i. e. have 
but one meaning in the premisses. 

5. The middle term must be distributed at least 
once in the premisses. 

6. A term must not be distributed in the con- 
clusion that was not distributed in its premiss. 

7. If both premisses are particular no conclu- 
sion can be drawn.

SECTION II. 



Figure. 

I. SPECIAL attention has not yet been called to 
the fact that the syllogism may have a variety of 
forms according to the position of the middle term. 
Sometimes it may seem best and most natural to make 
the middle term the subject of the major premiss and 
the predicate of the minor, sometimes the predicate of 
both premisses, &e. It is nt required to be in any 
particular position, but may take its place in the pre- 
misses according to the way the argument strikes the 
mind of the reasoner. Thus take the syllogism, 

All liars go to hell. 

Good men do not go to hell. 

Therefore good men are not liars. 
This may be stated thus 

Good men do not go to hell. 

Liars go to hell. 

Therefore liars are not good men. 
And thus also 

None that go to hell are good men. 

Liars go to hell. 

Therefore liars are not good men. 
In the first two syllogisms the middle term "go 
to hell" is the predicate of both premisses in the 
third syllogism it is the subject of the major and the 
predicate of the minor premiss. 

Figure is the word used to denote the different 
positions of the middle term in syllogisms. The subject 
of figure may seem difficult to the learner but by a 
little application it will become plain. It is important 
to be familiar with it in order to deal readily with the 
various forms taken by syllogisms.

.II It is plain that the middle term can have 
but four different positions in the syllogism. 

1. It may be the subject of the major premiss 
and the predicate of the minor, which constitutes the 
first figure. 

2. It may be the predicate of both premisses, 
which constitutes the second figure. 

3. It may be the subject of both premisses, which 
constitutes the third figure. 

4. It may be the predicate of the major premiss 
and the subject of the minor, whicl; is the fourth 
figure. 

Now let M. represent the middle term and P. the 
major term, (being the predicate oi the conclusion) and 
S. the minor term, (being the subject of the conclusion) 
and we may represent the four figures thus, 



First Figure. 
M isP 
S isM 
S isP 


Second Figure. 
P isM 
S isM 
S is P 


Third Figure. 
Mis P 
Mis S 
S is P 


Fourth Figure. 
P isM 

MisS

A syllogism illustrating each figure may make 
this subject plainer. The middle term is enclosed in 
brackets. 

First Figure. 

Every (desire to gain by another's loss) is sin. 
All gaming is a (desire to gain by another's loss.) 
Therefore all gaming is sin. 

Second Figure. 

All intelligent men are (Mends to education.) 
Some wealthy men are not (friends to education.) 
Therefore some wealthy men are not intelli- 
gent men. 

Third Figure. 

Some (good men) are not learned. 

All (good men) are worthy of admiration.

to shakl i seyum kahenge. 

Chauthe. Agar hadd i ausat kubra men mahmul 
ho, aur sugra men mauzu ho, to shakl i chaharum hogi. 

Ab farz karo, ki II. hadd i ausat, aur A. akbar,

Therefore some who are worthy of admiration 
are not learned. 

Fourth Figure. 

No act of tyranny is (beneficial to the state) 
Some (things beneficial to the state) are unsuc- 
cessful. 

Therefore some unsuccessful things are not 
tyranny. 

III. These four figures must be examined in 
order. 

First Figure. 

It will be seen that the First Figure is in the form in 
which Aristotle's dictum applies to it directly, i. c. 

Of a whole class something is predicated. 

Something else is included in that whole class. 

Hence of this something else the same is predi- 
cated. 

By using the four categorical propositions accord- 
ing to their quantity and quality it will be found that 
there can be but four variations of the syllogism in 
the first figure. 



First Figure. 
All M is P 
All S is M 
All S is P 


Second Figure. 
All M is P 
Some S is M 
Some S is P 


Third Figure. 
No M is P 
All S is M 
No Sis P 


Fourth Figure. 
No M is P 
Some S is M 
Some Sis not P 



Now the first figure being in the form of "Aristo- 
tle's dictum" we affirm or deny the predicate of the 
whole class which is the subject. Hence it is manifest 
that in the first figure the major premiss is always a 
universal, consequently any syllogism in this figure 
with a particular major will be invalid. 

Since the minor premiss, according to Aristotle's 
dictum, always affirms that something belongs to the 
given class, it is plain that in the first figure the minor 
premiss must always be affirmative, consequently any

syllogism in this figure with a negative minor premiss 
will be invalid. 

Thus two rules have been obtained for the first 
figure i. e. 

1. The major premiss must always be universal. 

2. The minor premiss must always be affirmative. 
Hence there can be but four forms of syllogism 

in this figure, The other figures not being in the form 
to which Aristotle's dictum applies must be tested by 
the axioms and rules for syllogisms. 



Second Figure. 

Taking up the second figure it is found that the 
conclusion of syllogisms in it must always be negative, 
because the middle term is the predicate of both pre- 
misses and, as it must be distributed in at least one of 
the premisses, this requires that one of the premisses 
be negative, since only negatives distribute the predi- 
cate. If then one of the premisses be negative the con- 
clusion also must be negative according to tule, 
[p. 96 r. 2.] We may observe further, if the con- 
clusion be negative it distributes its predicate, which in 
this figure is the subject of the major premiss ; hence 
the major premiss with a subject distributed, will be a 
universal. 

Three special rules are thus obtained for the 
second figure viz. 

1. The major premiss must be universal. 

2. One of the premisses must be negative. 

3. The conclusion must be negative. 

Any syllogism in this figure which violates these 
rules is invalid.

Third Figure. 

This figure is of the form, M is P 

if is 8 
S isP 

The syllogism as varied by quantity and quality 
may have a greater variety of form in this figure thr.n 
iu any other. Two rules are formed for it. First the 
conclusion must always be particular, as will be seen 
by trying the syllogism in every form. Thus if both 
premisses be affirmative and we draw a universal con- 
clusion, the minor term which is its subject, would be 
distributed ; but, as the predicate of an affirmative minor 
premiss, it is not distributed, hence we would have an 
illicit process of the minor. The other possible oases 
are where one of the premisses is negative, as two ne- 
gative premisses are not allowable according to the 

rule. 

Let the major premiss be negative, then the 
minor premiss being affirmative does not distribute its 
predicate the minor term hence the conclusion of 
which it is the subject cannot be universal, else we 
would have here also an illicit process of the minor. 
If the minor premiss be negative, the major must be 
affirmative and the conclusion negative, according to 
rule ; hence if we draw a universal negative the major 
term, which, as predicata of an affirmative proposition 
was not distributed, would be distributed as the pre- 
dicate of a negative conclusion, being an "illicit 
process " of the major. Thus the conclusion in every 
case in this figure must be particular. 

Secondly, the minor premiss must always be affirma- 
tive, for it has just been proven that the conclusion in 
this figure must always be particular ; but if the 
minor premiss be negative its predicate, the minor 
term, would be distributed, and hence would require a

universal conclusion to avoid an " illicit process," and 
we have just seen that the conclusion cannot be 
universal in this figure. Hence the two rules. 

]. jytg conclusion mutt be particular. 

2. The minor premiss must be affirmative. 

Fourth Figure. 

The fourth figure is of the form, 

PisM. 

MisS. 

Sis P. 

This figure is an inversion of the first figure. It 
was not used by Aristotle but has been adopted by 
some logicians in later days. By some the fourth 
figure is rejected because it is supposed to be contrary 
to our natural order ofthought. As however by some awk- 
wardness of expression, an argument or syllogism may 
t^ke this form it is well to understand it and the rules 
according to which the fourth figure might be used. 
All the categorical propositions except a universal 
affirmative may be drawn as conclusions in this figure. 
It is observed in this figure that if tfie major premiss 
be affirmative the minor must be universal The reason 
is that the middle term which in this figure is the pre- 
dicate of the major premiss and the subject of the 
minor, would not be distributed at all if the premisses 
violate this rule, while it must be distributed at least 
once. [Rule 5, p. 104] Thus if the major premiss is 
affirmative, its predicate, which is the middle term, is 
not distributed ; hence the minor premiss of which it is 
the subject must be .universal to secure its distribution 

once. 

Again. If the minor premiss be affirmative the con- 
clusion must be particular. Otherwise we would have 
an " illicit process " of the minor. Thus if either pre- 
miss be negative the conclusion also must be negative

128 

[rule 2, p. 96 ;] honce its predicate which is the major 
term would be distributed [rule 4, p. 66] and this 
term beiug the subject of the mjor premiss requires 
this to be universal, otherwise the major term would be 
distributed in the conclusion but not in the premiss, 
involving, as said, an "illicit process." 

Thus there are three rules to which syllogisms in 
this figure must conform. 

1. If the major premiss be affirmative the minor 
must be universal 

2. If the minor premiss be affirmative the conclu- 
sion must be particular. 

3. If either of the premisses be negative the major 
must be universal. 

These rules of the four figures should be well 
stored in the memory for ready application. 

IV. It is worthy of note that each figure except- 
ing the fourth, which is merely an awkward form of 
argument into which the mind may accidentally stum- 
ble, lias its own special use or fitness in certain cases 
or forms of argument. Thus the first figure is that to 
which Aristotle's dictum applies directly, hence it is 
specially adapted for drawing conclusions from admit- 
ted universal or general principles or statements. For 
instance if it be admitted as a general principle that 
"All desire to gain by another's loss is sin," we may 
then go on to show that gaming is just such a desire, 
and hence draw the just conclusion that all gaming is 
sin. 

The second figure is specially adapted to disprove 
something that is maintained or ^believed to be true, or 
likely to be accepted, although false and injurious. 
It is thus useful in attacking and destroying the posi- 
siou of an opponent, rather than building up one of 
our own. In this figure, just as in the first, the major

premiss is a universal proposition or contains a class 
to which the consent of an opponent has been gained. 
Then it is proved that tho proposition advanced by 
him cannot be true, because it either wants something 
that belongs to this admitted class, or has something of 
which that class is destitute and hence can not bo 
accepted. Thus, suppose it is maintained or is likely 
to bo believed that " Jesus was an imposter, seeking to 
form a party for some selfish end." Now wo may set 
about refuting this by laying down tho proposition 
that, 

No impostor seeking to form a party for selfish 
ends would warn his followers that they would have 
to endure great persecutions. 

Jesus did so warn his followers. 
Hence Jesus was not an imposter. 

Suppose that some one is disposed to boliovo tho 
Bible to be merely a human production, because many 
things in it appear merely human, or seem to bo mixed 
up with human error. Now perhaps the consent of 
no one would be withheld from a proposition like this, 

Any book containing a spirit and character super- 
human, however hedged in by difficulties, must bo 
divine. 

Tho Bible appears to bo just such a book. 

Hence the Bible must be divine. 

The third figure is specially applicable for argu- 
ments in two cases. First where tho middle term is a 
singular term. A singular term or proper name is 
not used as a predicate; hence in this figure, as tho 
middle term is the subject of both premisses, a 
singular term may be used. Thus, 
Caesar was a tyrant. 
Csesar was a conqueror. 
Therefore some conquerors are tyrants, 
argument must thus sometimes take the form

of the third figure. Secondly this figure is useful when 
we wish to offer and maintain an objection to an 
opponent's premiss when he reasons from a particular 
premiss, while that premiss should be universal in a 
valid argument. We then show that the argument in 
its ligimate form proves too much. Suppose one con- 
tend that " a certain doctrine ought not to be believed 
because it cannot be explained or comprehended." 
His argument stated in full would be, 

Some doctrines that cannot be explained and 
comprehended ought not to be believed. 

The doctrine in question cannot be explained 
or comprehended. 

Therefore it is not to be believed. 



This put in symbols is, 

Some X is not Y. 

Z isX. 

Therefore Z is not T. 

which plainly contains an undistributed middle. The 
argument to be legitimate should be, 

Every doctrine that cannot be explained and 
comprehended ought not to believed.

Tho doctrine in question cannot bo explained or 
comprehended. 

Therefore it is not to be believed. 
Now the argument founded on this universal 
major premiss proves too much and we may urge an 
objection to it in the third figure thus, 

The connection of soul and body cannot bo 
explained and comprehended. 

The connection of soul and body must bo 
believed. 

Therefore some things that cannot be explained 
must bo believed. 

From this it is seen that the premiss of the op- 
ponent involves an error. 

The subject of Figure and its rules being well 
understood we turn to another matter connected with 
syllogisms viz., Mood.

rid hota hai, tisri shakl ki ru se. Maslan,

Euh aur jism ke darmiyan ilaqa jo hai, ham us

Pas baz bdten, jo samajh men nahin 6ti hain,

SECTION III. 



]Hood. 

By the mood of a syllogism is meant the designa- 
tion "by symbols of the quantity and quality of its 
three propositions in their order. It will be remem- 
bered that the four vowels A E I O were used to de- 
signate the quantity and quality of all propositions 
?*., universal affimative, universal negative, particular 
affirmative, particular negative. For example take the 
syllogism, 

Every desire to gain by another's loss is sin. (A.) 
Gaming is a desire to gain by another's loss. (A.) 
Therefore All gaming is sin. (A.) 

The three propositions of this syllogism are all 
universal affirmatives, hence the mood of the syllogism 
as indicated by the appropriate symbols is A A A. 

Now it is manifest that the four categorical pro- 
positions A E I O can bo arranged in 64 combinations 
or moods by the law of permutation. There are three 
propositions in the syllogism and each of these may be 
varied in four different ways as A E I O. Each of 
these symbols may be a major premiss, and each of 
these four majors may have in turn all the four cate- 
gorical propositions as minors, giving sixteen sets and 
to each of these sixteen sets the four categoricals may 
be used as conclusions, making the 64 combinations of 
syllogism.

Conclusions, A E I 0. 

This operation may be gone through with for 
each of the letters, and sixty four moods or forms of 
syllogism will be the result. 

Now many of these moods are not allowable be- 
cause thoy violate the rules laid down for syllogisms, 
and for the figures. Thus all moods having affirmative 
premisses with a negative conclusion as A A E, A I O 
arc inadmissable because they violate the first axiom. 
All moods with negative premisses as E E, 0, 
E O, &c., cannot be used because they violate a rulo 
j_p. 98, r. 3.] All moods with particular premisses 
arc not allowable as they violate a rule [p. 110, r. 7.] 
Some of the moods as I E must be rejected for an 
illicit process. Twenty-eight of the sixty-four moods 
are rejected on account of negative and particular pre- 
misses alone. It will be found that out of the entire 
sixty-four moods, only eleven are allowable as not vio- 
lating the rules for syllogism, vis.

cause they violate the rules against " undistributed 
middle" and "illicit process." Thus the moods I. A. I. 
which is valid in the third figure, cannot be used in 
the first figure, because it would involve an undistrib- 
uted middle. Again A. E. E. is a valid mood in 
the second figure, but in the first it would have an 
illicit process of the major term. By thus testing 
these eleven moods in the four figures, it is found that 
there would be six in each figure, that is, twenty four 
in all. Now of these twenty four moods five, though, 
valid, are thrown aside as useless, giving a particular 
conclusion when a universal might have been drawn. 
For example, A A I of the first figure is useless as 
A A A is allowable and really contains it. Thus. 

All human beings are mortal. 

All Hindus are human beings. 

Therefore some Hindus are mortal. 
This is a valid enough syllogism, but it is useless 
because we might draw here the universal conclusion. 

All Hindus are mortal. 

There will remain then nineteen moods in all, 
?. four in the first figure, four in the second, six in 
the third, and five in the fourth. They may be ar- 
ranged as follows : 

Fig. 1, A A A, E A E, A 1 1, E I O. 

Fig. 2, E A E, A E E, E I O, A O O. 

Fig. 3, A A I, I A I, A I I, E A O, O A O, E I O. 

Fig. 4, A A I, A E E, I A I, E A O, E I O. 



These are the only valid moods, and any syllogism 
not found in the moods of this table is to be rejected. 
If the table be committed to memory, the validity of

any syllogism proposed in an argument may be seen 
at once. 

By looking at this table of moods it will be seen 
that a universal affirmative can be proved only in tho 
first figure in which every other proposition may be 
proved also. In the second figure negatives only can 
be proved, in the third, particulars only. 

By some logicians, the moods of the first figure 
have been called perfect moods, because Aristotle's dic- 
tum, the law on which the syllogism is founded, can 
be applied directly to any syllogism in this figure. 
The moods of the other three figures can all be reduc- 
ed to the first figure by what is called "reduction", so 
that we can prove the same conclusion in the figure to 
which Aristotle's dictum immediately applies. 

3. Reduction consists in either changing by con- 
version or transposition the form of the syllogism into 
a mood of the first figure, so that the same conclusion 
can be drawn, or a conclusion \vhich becomes tho same 
by conversion as we had in the mood from which the 
change was made. Or the Conclusion of a syllogism 
in the second, third, or fourth figure may be shown to 
be correct by proving in the first figure that its con- 
tradictory is false. If we thus prove in the first figure 
that the contradictory is false, of course the original 
conclusion must be true. Some writers on logic pro- 
ceed at length to show how the truth of a conclusion 
in a syllogism of any of the last three figures can bo 
proved by "reduction" through the first figure, but the 
subject does not repay the labor of mastering it, since 
the rules given for testing the validity of syllogisms are 
sufficient for all practical purposes.

SECTION IV. 
Of Compound Arguments. 

THE HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM. 

So far we have considered only purely categorical 
arguments and syllogism, that is, such as are formed 
from categorical propositions. \V e come now to con- 
sider hypothetical forms of argument and the syllogism 
formed from them. An argument containing a hypo- 
thesis may be called a hypothetical argument. 

A syllogism containing a pure hypothetical pro- 
position is called a hypothetical syllogism and the 
syllogism will take its name as "conditional" or " dis- 
junctive" from the proposition contained in it. In 
the hypothetical syllogism the hypothetical proposition 
is the major premiss, the minor is a categorical, and the 
conclusion is also categorical. In the hypothetical 
proposition, the first member is called the antecedent, 
the second member the consequent. The antecedent 
and consequent may be inverted, as "John will be fit to 
travel, if he is not sick." 

We first examine the conditional syllogism which 
has for its major premiss a conditional proposition and 
for its minor a categorical. For example. 

If Zaid has a fever he is sick. 
Zaid has a fever. 
Therefore he is sick. 
Or If A is B, OisD. 
But A is B. 
Therefore C is D.

In this example it is plain that if wo affirm the an- 
tecedent, the affirmation of the consequent necessarily 
follows and we get the first rule for conditional pro- 
positions. 

1. If the antecedent be granted the consequent must 
be (/ranted also. 

But if we deny the antecedent we cannot therefore 
deny the consequent thus, 
Zaid has not a fever. 
Therefore he is not sick. 

For it is plain that he may be sick from some other 
cause than fever. 

If wo deny the consequent we may deny the 
antecedent also, thus, 
Zaid is not sick. 
Therefore he has not a fever. 

For it is plain that if Zaid is not sick he cannot 
have a fever, hence the second rule. 

2. If the consequent be denied the antecedent may 
be denied also. 

But it must be observed that if the consequent bo 
affirmed, wo cannot therefore affirm the antecedent 
and say, 

Zaid is sick. 

Therefore he has a fever ; 
for he may be sick from some other cause. 

Putting these two rules together we may draw 
from them a third rule. 

3. If the consequent be affirmed or the antecedent 
denied no conclusion can be drawn* 

When from the affirmation of the antecedent we 
pass to the affirmation of the consequent, the argument 
is called constructive, tmd when we pass from the denial 
of the consequent to the denial of the antecedent, the 
argument is called destructive. For the constructive

syllogism then, we take the whole of the conditional 
proposition as the major premiss, the affirmation of 
the antecedent for the minor, and from these premisses 
we draw the affirmative of the consequent as a conclu- 
sion. The following is a constructive syllogism, 

If this man is a sinner God is displeased 
with him. 

He is a sinner. 

Therefore God is displeased with him. 
In the destructive syllogism we take the whole of 
the conditional proposition as before for the major 
premiss, the denial of the consequent as the minor, and 
draw the denial of the antecedent as the conclu- 
sion. Thus, 

If this man is a sinner God is displeased 

with him. 

God is not displeased with him. 
Therefore he is not a sinner. 
Again, 
If just law prevails the rights of tin weaker arc 

secured. 

But the rights of the weaker are not secured. 
Therefore just law does not prevail. 
We may remark here that a conditional proposition 
is really a universal affirmative, whether the antecedent 
and consequent be universal or particular, affirmative 
cr negative. For instance, "if a man is sick he is not 
fit to travel. 1 ' Here the antecedent is a universal affirm- 
ative and the consequent a universal negative, yet the 
entire sentence is a universal affirmative proposition. 
The truth or falsity of the conditional proposition de- 
pends on the consequent, that is, if the consequent 
follows from the antecedent the proposition is true, 
otherwise it is false. The conditional proposition may 
be true as a proposition, and yet the antecedent and 
consequent be false, thus, > 

" If science is a bad thing, it should be neglected/

This proposition is true although both its members 
are false. 

The conditional syllogism may be reduced to a 
simple categorical one by removing the conditional 
character of the major premiss. 

The form of condition may be removed by the 
phrases "in case of and "the present case." The 
proposition then becomes categorical, with the anteced- 
ent for its subject and the consequent for its predi- 
cate ; thus, 

In case . Zaid has a fever he is sick. 

The present case is a case of Zaid having 

a fever. 

Therefore in the present case Zaid is sick. 
The same rules apply for testing the validity of 
conditional syllogisms as for categorical. 

Second, Disjunctive Syllogisms. 
The disjunctive syllogism is one the major pre- 
miss of which is disjunctive and the minor categori- 
cal. It is of the form, 

Either A is B or it is 0. 
AisB. 

Therefore A is not 0. 

Example. This metal is either gold or it is silver. 
It is not silver. 
Therefore it is gold. 

It will be seen that the major premiss consists of 
an alternative between two members. The minor pre- 
miss affirms the one and the conclusion denies the other, 
or, as in the second example, the minor denies the one 
and the conclusion affirms the other. 

We may have instead of two alternatives, three 
or more. Thus, 

Either A is B or or D. 
A is not B or 0* 
Therefore it is D. ,

Example* Either the world is eternal, or it pro- 
duced itself, or it is the work of an intelligent Being. 
But the world is not eternal, nor produced by 

itself. 

Therefore it must be the work of an intelligent 
Being. 

Again. The angle A must be equal to, or 

greater, or less, than the angle B. 
But it is neither equal to, nor less than B. 
Therefore it must be greater than B. 
The simple rule for disjunctives is that, 
If one or more of the alternatives is denied, the remaining 
one, or some one of those that remain, may be affirmed, 
and vice versa. 

This rule, however, is not without exception, for 
in some instances by affirming one we are not author- 
ized to deny the other; thus, 

"Virtue tends to procure us either the esteem 
of mankind or the favor of God." Here both parts of 
the proposition may be true. In such cases we must 
determine from the context whether the two members 
are intended to exclude one another or not.

SECTION V. 



Other forms of Argument. 

THE DILEMMA. 

THE dilemma is a compound argument or syllo- 
gism of which the major premiss is a compound con* 
ditional proposition, and the minor premiss a com- 
pound disjunctive proposition. 

In the dilemma there are in reality two or more 
conditional syllogisms blended into one, so that the 
statement is briefer than if each syllogism were separ- 
ately unfolded in the argument. 

The dilemma has several forms as, 

Simple dilemma. 

If A is B, or O is D, then E is F. 
But either A is B, or C is D. 
Therefore E is F. 

An other form of the simple dilemma is, 
If A is B, then C is D,or E is F. 
But is not D, nor E is F. 
Therefore A is not B. 

Complex dilemma. 

In this there are several antecedents each with its 
own consequent; thus, 

If A is B, G is H; and if C is D, L is M; and 

if E is F, X is Y. 

But either A is B or C is D or L is M. 
Therefore G is H or L is M or X is Y. 
These examples as given are in the constructive 
form, but if we wish we can reason in tha destructive 
form. 

An illustration of the first form or simple di- 
lemma is,

Minor, gratifie(L 



( Therefore the blest in heaven will be por-

It was remarked that the Dilemma is in reality 
two or more syllogisms blended into one with a dis- 
junctive minor. In illustration of this statement we 
may unfold this dilemma into the two syllogisms con- 
tained in it ; thus, 

If the blest in heaven will have no desires, they 

will be perfectly happy. 
But they will have no desires. 
Therefore the blest in heaven will be perfectly 

happy. 

Again. If the blest in heaven will have their 
desires fully gratified, they will be perfectly happ3 r . 
But they will have them fully gratified. 
Therefore the blest in heaven will be perfectly 

happy. 

An example of the second form of the simple di- 
lemma is, 

If man cannot make progress towards perfec- 

tion, he is either a brute or a divinity. 
But man is neither a brute nor a divinity. 
Therefore he can make progress towards per- 

fection, 

This also may be resolved into two syllogisms. 
If man cannot make progress towards perfection 

he is brute. 

But man is not a brute. 
Therefore he can make progress toward per- 

fection. 

Again. If man cannot make progress towards 
perfection he id a divinity.

kai muqaddam hote hain, aur har muqaddam k tali

158 

But man is not a divinity. 
Therefore he can make progress toward per- 
fection. 

An example of the third or compound form of 
the dilemma, in which there are several antecedents 
each with its own consequent, is 

f If this man was wise he would not speak ir- 

reverently of God in jest, and if he were 

Major 9 < good he would not do so in earnest, and if 

1 he were a well-wisher of humanity he would 

L not do so in forgetfulness even. 

But he either does it in jest or in earnest or in 
Minor. forgetfulness. 

Therefore he is either not wise or not good or 
Con. not a lover of humanity. 

This dilemma may be thus resolved into the three 
syllogisms contained in it, 

/ If this man were wise he would not speak irrev- 
, } erently of God even in. jest. 

j He does speak irreverently of God in jest. 
\ Therefore he is not wise. 

/ If this man were good he would not speak of 
^ J God irreverently in earnest. 

j He does speak irreverently in earnest. 
\ Therefore he is not good. 

flf this man were a well-wisher of humanity he 
would not speak irreverently of God in for- 
getfulness. 
He does speak irreverently of God in for- 
getfulness. 
Therefore he is not a well-wisher of humanity. 

The difference between the dilemma then, and any 
simple conditional syllogism is that the dilemma really 
contains in a contracted form two or more conditional 
syllogisms. 

The dilemma may be stated also in a categorical 
form and the rules for testing the validity of the syllo- 
gism applied directly to it, Just as in reducing a con-

SECTION VI. 
The Enthymeme. 

THE enthymeme is a syllogism with ono premiss 
omitted. It is thus a contracted syllogism- As was 
remarked in another part of this work on the syllo- 
gism (page 92, 5) in reasoning, some propositions 
in the chain of argument are usually suppressed be- 
cause the mind readily takes in the argument without 
unfolding all its steps at length. The enthymeme is 
a common form of abridged argument. Either pre- 
miss may be omitted from the syllogism. For example, 

All men are mortal. 

Csesar is a tiaan. 

Therefore Caesar is mortal. 
In this we may omit the major premiss, thus, 

Caesar is a man. 

Therefore Csesar is mortal. 

Or we may write it thus, suppressing the minor 
premiss, 

All men are mortal. 

Therefore Csesar is mortal. 

Now both these statements are satisfactory because 
the suppressed proposition is readily supplied in the 
mind. 

The completed syllogism may readily be constructed 
from the giyen enthymeme which always contains th,e 
three terms of the syllogism. By examining the con- 
clusion of the enthymeme we know at once what, the 
major, and minor terms of the syllogism are, since the- 
conclusion always contains these terms. Hence, since 
the subject of the conclusion is always the minor term 
and its predicate the major, we juay know which pre-

miss is given in the enthymeme from the term it 
contains. 

Thus, in the first example of the enthymeme 
given, we see that the given premiss must be the minor 
because it contains the subject of the conclusion, and 
in the second example the given premiss must be the 
major, because containing the predicate of the conclu- 
sion. Having thus ascertained what premiss is want- 
ing, the syllogism can at once be constructed and its 
validity tested by the rules for testing syllogisms* It 
may be remarked that, ordinarily, in speaking or writ- 
ing, the major premiss is suppressed, because being 
generally some fact or principle to which the mind 
yields ready assent. Thus in the example given, it 
would be more natural to suppress the major premiss, 
"all men are mortal," because this is a fact so establish- 
ed by observation as to command our assent. Hence 
wo would simply say, 

Ccesar is a man. 

Therefore he is mortal. 

Sometimes the enthymeme is not in the syllogis- 
tic form, thus, 

Csesar is mortal. 

Because Caesar is a man. 

When the causal conjunction " because, " thus 
ttnites the propositions of an enthymeme, they may be 
inverted and joined by the conjunction "therefore," 
atfd then the syllogism can be constructed from them. 
Thus with tbe above, 

Caesar is a man. 

Therefore Caesar is mortal. 
The rule for constructing the syllogism from the 
enthymeme is, 

ty the premiss given contains tfo subject of the con- 
clusion, it is the minor, if the predicate of the conclusion 
it is the major.

The Sorites. 

The Sorites is a string of contracted syllogisms of 
the first figure. It has already been remarked that in 
reasoning we do not usually unfold an argument in its 
full logical or syllogistic form, but suppress some of 
the proposition. Now if we have a string of syllogisms 
in the first figure, so arranged that the conclusion of 
each becomes a premiss in the next, these syllogisms 
may be contracted into the Sorites, in which the pre- 
dicate of the first proposition is made the subject of 
the next until the predicate of the last proposition is 
predicated of the subject of the first proposition. This 
is a very common form of argumentation. The fol- 
lowing is the form of the Sorites: 



AisB. 
BisG. 
CisD. 
DisB. 
EisF. 
Therefore A is V. 

Or by substituting propositions for these letters 
The mind is a thinking substance. 
A thinking substance is a spirit. 
A spirit is not matter. 
That which is not matter is indissoluble* 
That which is indissoluble is immortal. 
Therefore the mind is immortal. 

Now this abridged argument can be unfolded 
into the syllogisms contained in it, thus, - 
1 2.3 4 



B is 0. I C is D. 



AisB. A is 0. 
AisO. j AisD. 



DisE. 
AisD.

EisF.

Or if we substitute the propositions given for the 
letters then we will have,

Now it may be seen that these are all syllogisms iu 
the first figure, and by comparing them with the Sorites 
it will be observed that it contains, as middle, terms 
BODE which are used twice, that is the Sorites has 
as many middle terms as there are propositions between 
the first and the last, and consequently is an abridgment 
of that many syllogisms. It will be further seen from 
a comparison of these syllogisms, with the Sorites from 
which they are formed that it contains but one minor 
premiss, viz., A B. The other, are all majors. Hence 
it is plain that in the Sorites we simply take the only 
minor term given and by passing from middle term to 
middle term, link it with the final major term in a 
conclusion, as if we Jhad but one syllogism. Thus in 
the example given the minor A was joined to the majoi 
F through BODE. 

Since the Sorites is an abridgment of syllogisms in 
the first figure it is plain that its first proposition, and 
that alone, may be particular, because it is a minor pre- 
miss, and in the first figure the minor premiss may b 
particular but not the major (p. 122 r. 1.) and in the 
Sorites all the other proposition are majors. It is 
further manifest that in the Sorites there can be om 
and only one negative premiss and that the last ; I: 
if any other premiss were negative, one of the syllo- 
gisms contained in the sorites besides the last wouU

have a negative conclusion which becomes the minor 
premiss of the following syllogism, but in the first 
figure the minor premiss cannot be negative. We 
may then lay down the following rule. 

In the Sorites, except the conclusion, the first proposi- 
tion alone may be particular and only the proposition pre- 
ceeding the conclusion can be negative. 

A Sorites violating this rule is not valid. When 
the Sorites is resolved into syllogisms, these may be 
tested by the rules formed for this purpose. A rule 
for resolving the sorites may be thus stated. 

Take the second proposition of the sorites for the 
major premiss of the first syllogism, the first proposition 
for the minor and use the conclusion thus drawn for the 
minor premiss of the second syllogism, with the third pro- 
position of the sorites as a major and so on as long as any 
middle term remains. 

There is an inverted form of the Sorites called 
from the name of its inventor the Goclenian sorites. In 
it the propositions are reversed thus, 

B is R 
D is E. 
is D. 
B is 0. 
A is !B. 
Therefore A is F. 

The same in proposition thus, 

That which is indissoluble is immortal. 

That which is not matter is indissoluble. 

A spirit is not matter. 

A thinking substance is a spirit. 

The mind is a thinking substance. 

Therefore the mind is immortal. 

It will be observed here that the conclusion reached 

is just the same as before although the order of the 

propositions is reversed. It will be seen also that in 

this form we becrin with the most extensive propois-

tion first and reason from the general to the particular 
It may often best suit the argument to do so. 

The sorites may also be composed of conditional 
propositions and is then called the hypothetical sorites* 
The hypothetical sorites consists of a string of condi- 
tional propositions so arranged that the consequent of 
each becomes the antecedent of the succeeding one, arid 
the conclusion is drawn by either affirming the first 
antecedent with ihe last consequent or by denying 
the last consequent with the first antecedent. For 
example, 

If A is B, then is D. If A is B, then is D. 
IfC isD, thenEisF, or If is D, then E is F. 
But A is B. But E is not R 

Therefore E is F. Therefore A is not B. 

If Gtod is holy then He is not the author of 

sin. 

If He is not the author of sin, then the doc- 
trine of fate is false. 
But Gtod is holy, therefore the doctrine of fate 

is false. 

The second example is a destructive hypothetical 
BDrites. 

If gaming is a -good thing, the practice of it 

is right. : 
If the practice of it is right, it will result in 

good. 
But it does not result in good, therefore the 

practice of it is not right. 

The hypothetical -sorites may be reduced to the 
categorical one by the rule for reducing hypothetical 
to categorical propositions (p. 150.) It may then be 
tested by the rules for the sorites or it oaa be resolved 
into hypothetical .'syllogism* and *hen 'tested by 
the method for trying the validity of hypothetical 
syllogisms* [p, 160.]

Applied Logic. 

BY applied Logic is meant the practical use of 
the science for general purposes as distinguished from 
a mere knowledge of the science in the abstract t. e. a 
mere knowledge of the laws and rules of logic without 
any special reference to their use and application. It 
is one thing to have merely a knowledge of the nature 
and structure, so to speak, of a science, and quite another 
thing to be familiar with its practical use in every day 
life. For instance one may know the names of all the 
implements used in carpentering and the mode of using 
them, and have a knowledge of the rules used in that 
useful art and yet may not be able to make furniture. 
The knowledge required for this is quite different from 
a mere acquaintance with names and rules. Again by 
studying a book one may gain a knowledge of the 
nature and rules of surveying, but a practical or 
"applied" use of the science of surveying is obtained 
in the field and by observing. how, under different cir- 
cumstances, these rules are applied. Having gone 
over the laws, rules and terms that constitute the science 
of Logio, we propose in this part of our book to treat 
more of a practical application of the science showing 
how it is applied in .every life. We will first classify 
tbe different forms of error commonly met and illustrate 
the mode of treating them, and then explain some 
modes or forms in which arguments are commonly 
used.

SECTION I. 
Fallacies. 



HAVING described the various forms of argument 
and syllogism, it is important that we now consider 
more at length the various kinds of fallacy that may 
be used in reasoning, or into which one may fall. A 
fallacy is an invalid argument. As much of the 
practical usefulness of logic depends on the ready 
detection and exposure of fallacies, it is very important 
that the subject be well understood. The learner 
should strive to get a thorough acquaintance with all 
forms of fallacy. We are not simply to guard against 
the false weapons of others, but also against the mis- 
takes into which we ourselves are liable to fall in rea- 
soning. The fallacy may be in one or all of the three 
parts of the argument or syllogism. Some word or 
term may be used in a doubtful or double sense, or a 
proposition may be false, or the form of the syllogtem 
may be invalid. Now it is plain that all fallacies may 
be divided into two great classes, first where the error 
is in the form of the reasoning i.+e. where the conclu- 
sion does not follow from the premisses ; second where 
the error is not in the form of the reasoning . e. where 
the conclusion does follow from the premisses, .not with- 
standing an error in some term or proposition of the 
syllogisms. The first are called "logical or formal 
fallacies" the second "non-logical or non-formal fallacies ." 
The first great class will be described. 



Logical or formal Fallacies. 
The fallacies of this class include all violations of

Aristotle's dictum and the rules for syllogisms. They 
are of five kinds. 

1. Undistributed middle. 

2. Illicit process of the major or minor term. 

3. Negative premisses. 

4. Affirmative conclusion from a negative pre- 

miss or rice versa. 

5. More than three terms in the argument. 

In all these forms of fallacy the error is manifest 
from the form of expression when the syllogism is 
fully stated. But in practice frequently the difficulty 
of detecting the error arises from the argument being 
elliptical i. e. one of the propositions may be suppressed, 
or the fallacy may be so covered up in a volume of 
words that the error does not readily appear. In such 
case, if the argument is drawn out to its full form or 
stripped of its verbosity and put in the syllogistic 
form, the error becomes manifest. These errors were 
illustrated to some extent in drawing out the rules for 
testing the validity of syllogisms and we need do but 
little more here than classify them as above and give 
an additional illustration of each. Let it be well borne 
in mind that in these fallacies the conclusion does not 
follow from the premisses. Even if the conclusion be 
true, the argument is yet a vicious one. 

1. Undistributed middle. 

Form of fallacy. 

Some A is B. or All B is A. 

Some A is 0. All is A. 

Therefore some B is C. Therefore all B is 0.

men galati aisi chhip gai ho, ki ba asani na malum

Here it will be observed that neither t ho major or 
minor term is compared with the whole of the middle 
term i. e. the middle term is not distributed, hence the 
argument is not valid, as the conclusion does not fol- 
low from the premisses. Suppose one should argue 
that the religion of the Hindu is true because believed 
and taught by some good men ; his argument would 
contain an undistributed middle as may be seen by 
unfolding it thus, 

True religions are believed and taught by good 

men. 
The Hindu religion is believed and taught by 

good men. 

Therefore the Hindu religion is true. 
Here the middle term, "believed and taught by 
good men" being the predicate of two affirmatives is 
undistributed (p. 64 r. 3) hence the conclusion is an 
error. 

2. Illicit process of the major or minor term. 

Form of the fallacy. 

All A is B. All A is B. 

No is A. or All A is 0. 

Therefore No C is B. Therefore All is B. 





Suppose some one should argue that a certain 
man was not a bad king because he was uot a tyrant, 
His argument unfolded would be, 

All tyrants are bad kings,. 

Zaid was not a tyrant. 

Therefore Zaid was not a bad king*

Here the major term "bad king*' is distributed as 
the predicate of a negative [p. 66 r. 4] in the conclu- 
sion but not in the major premiss, because the predi- 
cate of an affirmative [p. 64, r. 3.] 

Again, suppose some one should argue that all 
instruction of women in science is bad because certain 
bad women were instructed. His argument when 
written in full, would show ap. illicit process of the 
minor; thus, 

Certain women were bad. 
They were women instructed in science. 
Therefore, all instruction of women in scienc e 
is bad. 

Here the minor term " instruction of women in 
science," is distributed in the conclusion but not in 
the minor premiss, because it is the predicate of an 
affirmative, hence the argument is not valid. 

3. Negative premisses. 


The form of this error is as if one would say, 

No A is B. ^^ x--v /^ 

No C is A. ( B H A ) ( ) 

Therefore No is B. \^ \Ix VV 

It is manifest that A the middle term is no 
medium of comparision between the other two terms, 
and although in this instance the conclusion is true, 
there might }>e instances in which B and 0, while not 
being A, would still have some connection with each 
other thus, Hence this is an 
erroneous form of argument. 
Suppose one were to argue that v- 

education has no connection with virtue and goodness, 
because a certain nation was not an educated nation 
neither was it a wicked nation. This would be an

example of negative premisses from which he would, 
not be justified in drawing any conclusion. The argu- 
ment stated in full would be, 

A certain nation was not a wicked nation. 
That nation was not an educated nation. 
Therefore an uneducated nation is not a wicked 
nation. 

4 Affirmative conclusion from a negative premiss 
and vice versa. 

First case. If one of the premisses is negative we 
can not draw an affirmative conclusion, because this 
would b3 declaring two things to agree in the conclu- 
sion when one of them had been declared not to agree 
with the same third in the premisses. This is contrary 
to the axiom for the syllogism [p. 94 a- 2.] Hence 
any syllogism or argument, in which an affirmative 
conclusion follows where one of the premisses is nega- 
tive, must be erroneous. 

Second case. We cannot draw a negative conclu- 
sion from affirmative premisses, for this would be 
declaring things not to agree in the conclusion that 
had agreed with the same third in the premisses, which 
is contrary to the axiom for syllogisms [p. 94 a. L] 
Hence any syllogism in which the conclusion is nega- 
tive from affirmative premisses may be pronounced 
erroneous. 

5. More than three terms in the argument. 

It is plain that a correct argument which may be 
put into the form of a valid syllogism must have only 
three terms, hence any argument containing more than 
three terms must be erroneous. 

This form of fallacy may arise in two ways ; either 
from ambiguity in the major or minor term, or from 
ambiguity in the middle term. In either case, where 
the word does not preserve the same meaning through-

out the argument, there will be really more than three 
terms in the syllogism. An example of this kind of 
fallacy in the minor premiss would be, 

A certain person was treated unjustly. 
He was wrongly imprisoned. 
Therefore a prison is a place of injustice. 

Here the fallacy lies in assuming that " wrongly 
imprisoned " and "prison" have the same meaning t. e. 
that the minor term of the minor premiss is the same 
as the minor term of the conclusion. 

Again. Hindus have a religious faith. 
Hindus are often guilty of falsehood. 
Therefore some guilty of falsehood are often 
faithful persons. 

Here the major term "faith " of the major pre- 
miss is really a different term from the major term 
"faithful" of the conclusion. 

The major and minor term then must preserve 
the same meaning in the premisses and conclusion 
otherwise there will be more than three terms in the 
syllogism. 

But the most common form of the fallacy of 
having more than three terms in the syllogism arises 
from the "ambiguous middle," hence this requires more 
careful guarding. Some word * is used as a middle 
term having a different meaning in the premisses, 
hence there are in reality four terms in the syllogism. 
The middle term should be the same word in both 
premisses and be understood in the same sense, for if 
the word be the same, but have a different meaning in 
each premiss, there are four terms in the syllogism. 

In every language there are a number of words 
which have various senses. Words which spring from 
the same root as noun, adjective, verb 8fc. 9 often differ 
widely in meaning, hence sometimes in use lead to an

"ambiguous middle." Thus faith v&& faithful though 
from the same root do not always convey the same 
meaning; thus, 

The faithful will be saved. 

John was firm in the faith. 

Therefore John will be saved. 
One may be resolute and firm in his religion 
without being faithful, hence the fallacy of this 
syllogism. 

There are many ways in which words come to 
have various meanings and hence are liable to mislead 
in argument. There may be an accidental resem- 
blance as " light " opposed to darkness and " light " 
opposed to heavy. There may be some resemblance 
between the different things for which the same word 
is used. Thus spear is used for a weapon and for a 
blade of grass. There may be some analogy in the 
purpose for which the word is used. Thus we speak 
of a the " kg" of a chair and of the " leg " of an animal 
because both are used as support ; of "sweet" food arid 
of " sweet " sound, because both are pleasing somewhat 
in the same way. Association again leads to calling 
different things by the same name ; thus "shot" may 
mean the ball used, the effect of the ball or the person 
shooting. In the same way by ellipsis the same word 
comes to mean different things : thus we use a person's 
name either to indicate the man or his^writings. A 
careful study of this matter will, lead to a proper dis- 
crimination and aptitude in detecting and exposing 
the ambiguous middle. The way to remove the 
ambiguity and detect the error is to fix on some tmi- 
form meaning for the word used as middle term, and 
then s$ that it remains the same in both premisses. 

There are two more forms of fallacy that should 
be discussed here as the error lies in the middle term.

The first of these is, 
Tlte Fattacia Accidentis. 

This error arises where the middle term is con- 
sidered in one premiss in reference to its essence or 
general nature and in the other premiss is considered 
in reference to some accident or something incidental 
to it, so that incongruous or incompatible things are 
compared in the conclusion. A simple illustration of. 
this error may he given, thus, 

Things bought iu the market are what we eat. 
Raw meat is a thing bought in the market. 
Therefore raw meat is what we eat. 

In the major premiss the middle term "things 
bought in the market" is considered in reference to its 
essence or general use, and in the minor term it is con- 
sidered in reference to one of its accidents, that is,, 
that meat bought there is "raw." The middle terto 
in one premiss has a general meaning and in the other 
an accidental or specific meaning; hence there are iu 
reality two middle terms, involving a fallacy in the 
conclusion. The check to this error is to s6e that the 
middle term have the same use in both premisses, that 
is, if it is used in the major premiss with reference to 
its essence or general nature, the same be preserved 
in the minor premiss* 

The fallacy of division and composition* 

This error arises where the middle term is used 
in a collective or additive sense in one premiss and in a 
distributive sense in the other. If it is first used in the 
major premiss in a collective sense and then in a dis- 
tributive sense in the minor premiss this is the "fallacy 
of division." If the middle term is used in a distribu- 
tive sense in the major premiss and in a collective sense

in the minor, this is the "fallacy- of composition." 
Familiar examples follow. 

Hindus are idolaters* (collectively) 
Ham Chandar is a Hindu, (separately) 
Therefore R&m Chandar is an idolater. 
This is the fallacy of division, for in the major pre- 
miss, Hindus are considered collectively or as a people, 
and as such are idolaters ; but in the minor premiss 
they are considered as individuals, and hence it cannot 
be said of all that they are idolaters, and Ram Chandar 
may not be an idolater. 

Again. Zaid, Amr, Bakr are Mohammedans, 
(separately.) 

Mohammedans were engaged in the mutiny. 

(collectively.) 
Therefore Zaid, Amr, Bakr were engaged in 

the mutiny. 

Here we have the "fallacy of composition/' for in 
the major premiss the middle term "Mohammedans" is 
considered separately, or as referring to certain in- 
dividuals, but in the minor premiss the term "Moham- 
medans" is used collectively for a people who were 
generally engaged in the mutiny. Hence as the mid- 
dle term is used in a distributive sensa in the major 
premiss, and in a collective sense in the minor, there 
arises the "fallacy of composition" in saying that Zaid, 
Amr, Bakr were engaged in the mutiny, for they may 
have had nothing to do with it. 

Another simple example of both errors is, 

Five is one number. 

Three and two are five. 

Therefore three and two are one number, mak- 
ing the fallacy of division. 

Three and two are two numbers. 

l?ive is three and two. 

Therefore five is two numbers, making the fal- 
lacy of composition.

This error is checked by seeing that the middle 
term be used in the same collective or distributive 
sense in both premisses. 

Second, Non-logical or non-formal fallacies. 

Nojat -logical fallacies are those, as was remarked, 
where the fallacy is not in the form of the argument, 
but in the matter of the propositions that make up the 
argument. In this kind of fallacies, the conclusion 
does follow from the premisses, so that the error is n0t 
in the /0m of reasoning but, as said, is in the matter of 
the propositions which are, in the case of the premisses, 
either false or unduly assumed, or the error may be 
that the conclusion is irrelevant i. e. not the one 
required. Non-logical fallacies then may be divided 
into 

Fallacies in the premisses. 
Fallacies in the conclusion* 

First, where the error is in the premisses. There 
are several forms of this ferror, as a premiss may either 
depend on the conclusion or be in itself entirely false. 
"We notice, 

1. The Petitio Principti, in which a premiss de- 
pends on the conclusion. This is the fallacy called 
* 'begging the question" and consists in proving the 
conclusion from a premiss that depends on the truth 
of the conclusion, or is the same in sense as the conclu- 
sion. The point or question to be proved is thus 
"begged" because it is cessumed in fact in the pre- 
misses, while a conclusion should not be thus assumed 
"but be proved by independent propositions. Suppose 
one should attempt to prove the proposition (conclu- 
sion) that God is eternal, and offer as proof the state- 
ment that he is without beginning or end. Here the 
proof and the conclusion to be drawn are in reality

the same and the argument put in tho form of a syllo- 
gism would be. 

Any being without beginning or end of existence 

is eternal. 

God is without beginning or end of existence. 
Therefore God is eternal. 

Here the premisses are true enough, but the argu- 
ment is invalid because they unduly assume the con- 
clusion. 

As a further example of this form of error, sup- 
pose that one should argue that a certain religion is 
true because its sacred books are from God. Here 
the proposition offered in proof of the truth of the 
religion really assumes that the religion is true, for if 
its sacred books are from God, it follows that the religion 
is true, but all of this is the point to be proven by in- 
dependent propositions. This error will be detected 
by observing carefully whether the premisses unduly 
depend on the conclusion itself or assume its truth. 

2. Arguing m a circle is another form of fallacy 
in which the premiss is unduly assumed, because de- 
pending on the conclusion. It differs from the 
"petitio principii" in this that the premiss and conclu- 
sion need not be the same in import. It consists in 
making the premiss and conclusion prove each other. 
Thus one proposition (premiss) is offered in proof of 
another (the conclusion) and when the proof of that 
proposition is demanded the conclusion is offered ; the 
same as to soy, A is true because B is true, and B 
is true becaue A is true. Suppose that one should 
argue that female education should not lie maintained 
because it is wrong and then argue that it is wrong 
because it is female education ; this would be reason- 
ing ip $ circle and the same a? to say, A is not true 
because B is not true, and B.is not true because A iq

not true. This error is checked lay demanding an in- 
dependent proof for both propositions. 

The wider the circle, that is, the more proposi- 
tions involved before reaching the last which depends 
cm the first, the more difficult is the error of detection, 
because the fallacy may be thus lost sight of in the 
lengthened argument. Thus, A is true because B is 
true, B is true because C is true, C is true because D 
is true, D is true because E is true, E is true because 
A is true, is a wider circle in which the mind might 
lose sight of the unfair dependence of the last proposi- 
tion on the first. Of course the way to check the error 
would be to demand an independent proof for the last 
proposition from anything given in the circle. 



3. "Won anted pro causa" This is the assigning 
of a false cause or reason for some effect or conclusion. 
In this case the premiss is false or at least unsupported. 
There is no more common form of fallacy than* this. 
Some event occurs or some fact is stated for which a 
cause is assigned that has no connection with it. Thus 
ignorant people especially are ever ready to assign 
false causes for famine and various calamities. For 
instance, eclipses are supposed to be the cause of num- 
erous effects with which they have no possible connec- 
tion. A man gets sick or dies, and it is attributed to 
displeasure of some god orevil spirit. A certain

king was beheaded and his son ascended the throne. 
This son once met a man, then blind, who had opposed 
his father to whom he said "Do you not think your 
crimes against my father were very great since you 
have been punished by God with the loss of your eyes?" 
"Nay, your majesty" replied theblindman, "if my crimes 
on that account may be considered great, how much 
greater the crimes of your father, seeing that he ws 
punished by God with the loss of his head while I have 
lost only my eyes" The king must have felt the force 
of this reply to his "non causa pro causa" and he must 
have seen that the cause assigned was as good in one 
case as the other. An example of the "nan causa pro 
causa" is found in the statement sometimes made that 
the tyranny of the English Government was the cause 
of the rebellion in India; when in reality the real 
cause was something else, as the fanaticism and poli- 
tical ambition of the natives. 

Sometimes the non causa pro causa takes the form 
of a question which assumes unduly that something is 
so, the interrogatory form aiding in concealing the un- 
due assumption. The question was once asked, why a 
vessel of water is no heavier after a fish is put in it 
than before. Efforts were made to determine the rea- 
son, without reflecting that the question assumes an 
error, for the vessel is heavier with the fish in it. The 
way to meet this form of error is to demand that the 
cause itself be proven, and not to accept it till some 
satisfactory proof be given that it is the real cause of 
the event or effects produced. In case of a question 
the fact assumed should not be accepted till proved.

204: 

These three "pctitio principio" "arguing in a circle" 
and "non causa pro causa" are the principal forms of 
"non logical fallacy" where the error is in the pre- 
misses. We now turn to non logical 

Fallacies in the Conclusion. 

The common term for this form of error is "ignoratio 
clenchi" or " irrelevant conclusion." The conclusion 
established is not the one required, but something 
that conceals or appears to be it, or diverts atten- 
tion from the required ' elerichus " or conclusion. 
Elenchus is a Greek word which means the contradic- 
tory of an opponent's assertion. 

The "irrelevant conclusion" then is the establish- 
ment, either from ignorance or design, of a conclusion 
not required in the argument. Thus suppose the 
question is, whether a man committed a certain theft 
or not. Now the one that undertakes to prove it, 
finding it difficult to establish the theft, sets about 
proving the man a rascal at any rate, which is not the 
point to be ascertained but an "irrelevant conclusion." 
There are various forms of this error as will bo seen 
when we come to speak of them at length. Sometimes 
the question is dexterously changed to something 
else. Sometimes an effort is made to bring an oppon- 
ent into a state of mind to accept a conclusion not 
proven, by^ arousing in him some passion or feeling. 
The way to meet this error is to settle clearly the point 
of dispute or inquiry, and keep this well in view. 

Any diversion or conclusion "irrelevant" to this 
should be promptly rejected. Some common forms of 
this fallacy are enumerated below. 

1. Argumentum ad hominem, or ''personal argu- 
ment." This is an unfair appeal to the passions, pre- 
judices, personal opinions, vanity, modesty &c, of an 
opponent or those whom it is desired to convince. An

unfair effort mny be made to arouse the anger or 
ridicule of persons against the truth. A "laugh" some- 
times brings the truth into contempt. A few simple 

illustrations of this error will make it plainer. 

* 

If an unworthy beggar appears before your door, 
and to your statement that he is not a fit subject for 
alms, replies by an appeal to your feelings of charity 
and compassion for the poor, and sense of duty in alms- 
giving, this would be a fair example of the arg amentum 
ad hominem. The conclusion of the beggar's argument 
would be "irrelevant" because the propriety of mani- 
festing feelings of charity and compassion Tor the poor, 
and the duty of alms-giving in general is not the ques- 
tion, but rather, is this particular person a fit subject for 
charity. The beggar avoidos the question but tries to 
gain his point by a personal appeal. 

Again many persons in India who object to female 
education do not attempt to prove directly that the 
thing in itself would bo an injury, either to females or 
to the country generally, but try to arouse the pre- 
judices of people against it by saying that it is not the 
custom and that they will bring discredit upon their 
families by sending their daughters to school. All 
attempts then to gain some point by passing by the 
real question at issue, and appealing to passion, pre- 
judice, vanity &c. constitute the "argumentum ad 
homiuem." 

This error should be met by calmly referring to 
the question at issue and keeping attention on that. 

It may be observed that any proper appeal to pas- 
sion or feeling to establish the real question at issue is 
not an error and may be justly employed.

Z. The fallacy of shifting ground. Let it be kept 
in mind that we .are discussing the "irrelevant conclu- 
sion" i. e., cases where the required conlusion is not 
drawn but something foreign to it, and which, if estab- 
lished, gives the appearance of having gained the point 
in dispute. The fallacy of shifting ground is a com- 
mon artifice for this purpose. Often during a discus- 
sion, when one finds that he cannot maintain his point, 
he slyly shifts the discussion to some other proposition 
different from the one under consideration in whole or 
in part. Thus suppose one is trying to prove that the 
drinking of a single drop of ardent spirit is wrong, but 
failing in this, he quietly sets about proving that the 
drinking of ardent spirits in excess is wrong, which is 
quite another question. This fallacy is effected in 
various ways. Sometimes an ambiguous or general 
term is used, and when it cannot be maintained in ono 
meaning a second or a third meaning is claimed for it. 
Thus an attempt may be made to prove that a certain 
people have faith in God in the sense of knowing him 
aright and obeying him, but on failing in this an 
attempt may be made to prove that they have faith in 
the existence of one God, which is a different conclusion 
or "ground/' Sometimes a particular is proved when 
a universal should be proved. Thus some persons on 
failing to prove that the Christian religion is not good, 
"shift" their "ground" by showing that particular 
persons are not good, which is not the required conclu- 
sion, and if it be proved even, the real question is not 
touched. 

Sometimes the discussion is shifted from one to 
the other of an opponent's premisses alternately. The 
attack on failing on one is changed to the other, and on 
failing there is shifted back again without settling 
finally any one point. No fallacy is more common

2. Mug.dlta i tagaiyur i mazmun. Is bdt ko yad 
rakhn& ch&hiye, ki yih bahs natija i gair matlub ki 
hai, yane uatija matlub na nikdle jawe balki koi aur 
aisi b&t gair matlub, ki agar qaim ki jdwe, to ba zahir 
malum ho ki yih wuhi hai. Graraz yih fareb, yg.ne 
" tagaiyur i rnazmiin" jawab donewdla aksar is maq- 
sad ke waste karta hai, ki mubahise men jab wuh 
dekhtd hai, ki main npni bahs par qaim nahin rah saktd 
hun, to us bahs ko chhor kar aur b^t par, jo bilkull 
mukhtalif ho, yd bilkull na ho balki kuohh ho, bahs 
karne lagta hai. Maslau farz karo, koi shakhs sdbit

hai, HIM gar sabifc na kar sake, to chalaki se bahs ko ba- 
dalkar kahne lage, ki tcz nashe ka bahut && pina ^undh

ho jawegi. Baz jgah aisfi hotd hai, ki qaziyaijuz'ya

than this in a weak disputant of shifting the discussion 
from one proposition to another in a perpetual round 
or flight without fully settling any one point. Thus 
often in religious disputes we will find persons combat- 
ing first one and then another of an opponent's doctrines 
with a great noise and clamor of words, but not wait- 
ing for a full reply on any point nor delaying to either 
disprove it or acknowledge defeat. 

The effective way to deal with the fallacy of shift- 
ing ground is to fix some meaning on doubtful or 
general terms and settle the "ground" of dispute fairly 
and clearly in the beginning, and demand that the dis- 
pute remain there ; and in case an opponent "shifts" 
his attack from premiss to premiss alternately, or from 
one proposition to another the demand should be made 
that a proposition^taken in A hand be settled before 
passing to another. 



3. The fallacy of objections. This consists in 
raising some objection against a proposition or science 
or proposed improvement, and then because this objec- 
tion can be urged concluding that the proposition, 
science, or proposed improvement or whatever the 
point may be against which the objection is urged is 
erroneous, -or not to be maintained. The "fallacy of 
objections" is put under the division of "irrelevant 
conclusion'' because, simply the conclusion that objec- 
tions can be urged against a proposition, is not the 
conclusion to be drawn, but rather it should be shown 
whether the objections have greater weight against the 
proposition than the reasons ichich can be urged for 
it. This is the point to be proved and not simply 
that some objections can be urged against the proposi- 
tion* Many truths have such a weight of evidence in

ho sakta hai, to dusre par iatiraz karne lagta hai, aur 
jab dusre par bhi iatirdz nahin ho sakta hai, to phir

karta hai. Agar bahs karnewald kam aql ho, to us ko 
is se barhkar aur koi mugdlta nahin parta hai, ki ek 
qaziye ko chhorkar dusre par chala jata hai, hamesha 
idhar udhar ghurata phirta hai, kisi bahs par bakhubi 
qdina nahin rahta hai. Mazhabi mubahison men ham ne 
aksar dekha hai, ki muqdbilawald ek masle par iaitiraz 
karta hai, aur phir aur par bare shor o gul ke sdth. 
Zara thaharta nahin, ki purd jawab pa we yd dp radd

ki agar koi lafz mushtarak ho, yd amm ho to auwal us

muqaqdame yd qaziye par bari bari se jdne lage. to us e

their favor that no one should hesitate for a moment 
t ) accept them, and yet there may be some pbusible 
objections urged against them. An opponent of these 
truths by making a noisy parade of the objections 
might make it appear that they should be rejected and 
in this lies the fallacy. 

For instance a medicine has been useful in scores 
of instances, but in a few cases failed ; now it would 
be erroneous to urge that because in a few instances it 
had failed that the medicine is not a good one. The 
Bible has many and weighty arguments to prove that 
it is God's book and that it has remained uncorrupted 
through ages down to the present 'time. Yet because 
some objections or difficulties can be urged aguinst it, 
some persons claim that it should be rejected. This is 
the "fallacy of objections" and the question here should 
be, is there a preponderance of evidence in favor of the 
inspiration and uncorrupted preservation of the Bible? 
Another illustration of the "fallacy of objections" is 
found in the objections that are urged against some 
change or improvement in the government or public 
works of a country. Although the change may have 
many reasons to commend its adoption, yet because 
one or two objections may be urged against it, some 
persons are ready to reject it. 

Where the fallacy of objections is urged against 
any question or proposition it should be met by the 
position, that while the proposition has stronger argu- 
ments in its favor than can be urged against it, it is 
not disproved and this point should be kept clear above 
all the clamor of debate. 

4. The fallacy of proving only a part. This is just 
the reverse of the "fallacy of objections" and consists in 
proving only a part of what is required and then 
claiming that the whole question has been proved. 
Thus suppose that the question is whether a certain

book is good or not. Now if only a few good points 
could be shown in the book it would be the "fallacy of 
proving only apart" to argue therefore that the book is 
a good one. The question to be proved IP, "is the 
book upon the whole a good one." To prove any- 
thing short of this is "irrelevant." Again suppose 
the question is, "whether a certain government is a 
good one or not." Now to prove two or three good 
points in the government is not enough, but the gov- 
ernment should be considered as a whole ; anything 
short of this is proving but a part and a partial con- 
clusion is "irrelevent" here. The fallacy of proving a 
part should be met with a demand that while proof for 
the "whole" question is not brought forward it must 
not be decided. The caution may here be given that 
in every question, care should be taken not to attempt 
to maintain too much, for if more is claimed in the 
question than can be fairly proved, the argument is 
open to the objection that it involves the "fallacy of 
proving only a part." 

These four kinds of fallacy then, "argumentum ad 
hominem" " shifting ground" *" fallacy of objections" 
and "fallacy of proving only apart of a question' 9 include 
the usual forms of "irrelevant conclusion." 

We may give here some general rules for the 
examination of arguments and then conclude the sub- 
ject -of fallacies with a recapitulation. 

First then, reduce the reasoning or argument to 
the form of a syllogism. This can be done in the 
following manner whether it be an oral discourse, a 
book, chapter or section. Observe what the concluding 
assertion or position is, for this is usually the conclusion. 
Go back from this and ascertain on what grounds this 
assertion is made or from what reasons this conclusion 
is drawn. These "grounds" or "reasons" will be tho 
premisses, and from the conclusion and premisses thus 



kitdb aehchhi hai 3 a naliin? aur us ko jawab men 
kah& j&we, ki ohaxxd baydnat us kitdb men achchho

baton par gaur karke natija nik&ln& ohfiliiye, aur agar

to yih natija yahan par gair matldb hoga, kyunki bahs 
bamari kuU par thi na juz par. Graraz ki w mugalta i 
Bubut i juzi" se mahfuz rahne ke waste kulli par dalil

obtained the syllogism or syllogisms, as the case may 
be, can be constructed which may then be tested by 
he rules of* syllogising. 



1st. Observe whether the syllogism be categori- 
cal or hypothetical. If hypothetical the rules for the 
hypothetical must be applied. 

2nd. If categorical count the terms. 

3rd. If there are only three terms ascertain 
whether the middle term is distributed and is used in 
:>nly one sense. 

4t/i. Observe whether the premisses are both 
negative in reality or in rppearance merely. 'Tfbut 
:>ne is negative, see if the c< nolusion is negative also; or 
both are affirmatives, observe if the conclusion is 
iffirmative. 

5th. Mark what terms are distributed in the con- 
clusion and ascertain Whether they are distributed also 
in the premisses. 

6t/i. If the syllogism is in the first figure observe 
if it is in the form of Aristotle's dictum. 



If no fault appears in the syllogism as such, that is 
in thefonn of the reasoning, then proceed to try the 
truth of the premisses and the "relevancy" of the con- 
clusion. Take each premiss separately and observe : 

]&. Whether it is self evident or not. 

2nd. If not self evident, but requiring proof, 
mark if the ground or proof on which it rests is valid 
or not.

3rd. Observe whether the premiss is the same 
as the conclusion in reality or whether it depends upon 
it. 

If the premisses are true and unobjectionable, 
turn to the conclusion and observe ; 

1st. ) If it is "relevant" that is the one required 
in this argument. 

2nd. If it is the one that the reasoner set out 
to prove or has the question been changed. 

3rd. If it is the whole or only &part of what 
should be proved. 

Some such analysis as this will generally lead to 
the detection of any errors in an argument. Each form 
of fallacy in the recapitulation should be studied and 
dwelt on till its nature is fully understood and till it 
can be illustrated by a number of instances.

SECTION II. 



Of certain methods of applying Logic. 

THERE are certain peculiar methods of applying 
the reasoning process in practical life to which appro- 
priate names are given. We propose to describe these 
and illustrate their mode of application. It will be 
seen that the reasoning process, although always really 
the same, in practical use in the search for truth or in 
the refutation of error is varied in method. 



Induction. 

1. Induction is the inferring of general truths 
from particular truths or facts that have passed under 
observation. A number of facts or things are found 
always associated in the same way, or accompanied by 
the same phenomena ; hence we conclude that this class 
of facts are always so and infer some general law or 
truth in regard to them. For instance it has been 
observed that lead, iron, silver gold &c., melt when a 
sufficient degree of heat is applied to them. Hence the 
general truth is inferred that metals are fusible. Again 
it is observed that cows, sheep, goats, deer, and other 
horned animals ruminate, hence the rule is inferred 
that horned animals ruminate. Again it has when 
observed in hundreds of trials that pure water resolved 
into its elements in chemical analysis yields but two 
gases oxygen and hydrogen in the proportion of 8 to 1 ; 
hence it is inferred that all pure water consists of two 
elements oxygen and hydrogen combined in the pro- 
portion of 8Jx> 1.

ed on the belief that the laics of nature are uniform. 
This belief itself is perhaps an induction. From 
childhood up, we observe that the sun uniformly rises 
and sets, that day and night succeed each other in the 
same regular order, that the seasons come and go, 
that seeds germinate and plants grow, and produce 
flowers and fruit in the same order ; hence the belief 
has fastened itself in the mind from these observations 
that nature's laws are uniform. For this reason, when 
in a number of cases we see the same thing accompanied 
by the same phenomenon, we infer from the uniformity 
of nature's laws that it will always be so. 



3. The induction will be complete or incomplete 
according to the number and accuracy of the observations 
that have been made. It would be an incomplete and 
hasty induction to infer a general law or truth from a 
few facts or, from a few hasty and immature observa- 
tions. Yet this is a common mistake ; and bo- 
cause a thing happens in a certain order or connec- 
tion for a few times, it is referred to some cause with 
which it has no connection whatever. It is a common 
saying among the Hindus that eclipses have an un- 
favorable influence on the birth of children, because per- 
haps, in some instances, unfavorable births have taken 
place in connection with eclipses j although there is no 
possible bad influence in the eclipses over the birth of 
a child, as the thousands of favorable births at times 
when eclipses have taken place should prove. If it 
should occur twice or thrice in a life time, that a jour- 
ney, undertaken when an animal crossed the road 
before us, proved bad, we should not therefore infer 
that there is some unfavorable sign in an animal 
crossing our track. ^ On the contrary, a correct induc- 
tion would show us that the instances are vastly more

numerous where the crossing of our track by an aninial 
was followed by a prosperous journey. 

Induction will be complete in proportion to the 
number of cases that have passed under observation. 

An absolutely complete induction would be where 
all the cases had passed under observation. But this 
is usually not practicable, and indeed is not necessary, 
since a number of observations, more or less just, as the 
case seems to demand, satisfy the mind that a general 
law or truth has been reached. For instance, it is not 
necessary to analyze all the water in the world to be 
sure that water is composed of two gasses. Repeated 
trials have satisfied the mind that this is the fact. A 
complete induction, then, is where the trials have been 
sufficient to satisfy the mind and warrant the conclu- 
sion. From the process of induction, different degrees 
of belief arise, in proportion to the completeness of the 
induction. If the examples have not been numerous, 
the field of observation having been limited, there may 
be a degree of doubt in the conclusion ; but if the 
observation has been very extended the belief may 
rise to absolute certainty. 



4. Nearly all Science is the result of induction. 
Numerous observations and experiments having been 
compared, general principles and laws are inferred from 
them* These principles and laws classified, constitute 
Science. Thus the Sciences of astronomy, geology, 
chemistry, b6tany, medicine, &c., have been developed. 
Centuries of observation and experiment have been 
required to bring some of these Sciences to their pre- 
sent degree of perfection. Induction will mature them 
still further, as new observations are made and new 
facts are compared.

5. All inductions can be reduced to the syllogistic 
form. An induction is usually in the form of an 
enthymeme, the major premiss being suppressed. 
Observation having been made in a number of-casos, 
we conclude that whatever is true of them is true of 
the class to which they belong. This is an induction, 
and put in the syllogistic form would stand thus, 

A is true of X, Y and 55. 

B is the class to which X, Y and Z belong. 
Therefore A is true of B. 
To illustrate this by an example : 

Whatever is true of the cow, sheep, goat, deer, 

&o., is likely true of all horned animals. 
Rumination is true of the cow, sheep, - goat, 

deer, &c. 
Therefore rumination is likely true of all horned 

animals. 

In an induction, we simply discover that some- 
thing common belongs to a number of cases, and tlien 
infer that it belongs to all things of this class. In- 
spection of the above illustrations shows that the major 
premiss is suppressed in such inductions. This major 
premiss is some such proposition as " Whatever is true 
of the case or cases which ice have examined is likely true 
of the whole class to which they belong" 

Inductions taken singly may also be put in 
the form of syllogisms. Thus take the inductions, 
"Lead is fusible, .therefore some metal is fusible," 
" Silver is fusible, therefore some metal is fusible/ 7 ; we 
find that the major premisses "lead is a metal/' "silver 
is a metal" are suppressod. 
The fall syllogisms are, 

Lead is a metal* 

Lead is fusible. 

Therefore some metal is fusible. 
And, 

Silver is a metal. 

Silver is fusible. 

Therefore some metal is fusible.

jdtd tai, ki "kubra sisa dhdt hai/' "ehdndi dhdt hni/' 
muqaddar hai. Agar yih istiqrd ba surat i qiy6s likhd 
jdwe to ydn hogd : 



228 

From a number of such inductive syllogisms, re- 
duced to one single syllogism, we get a general fact or 
law as a conclusion. Thus, 

Lead, silver, gold, iron, &o., are metals. 

These are fusible. 

Therefore metals are fusible. 



Of Deduction. 

Deduction is just the opposite of induction. In 
induction we infer general laws or principles from facts ; 
in deduction we deduce certain effects from general 
laws. By induction we have learned that certain 
things are poisonous. With this general fact before 
us, we conclude, that if a certain person has taken one 
of these things he is poisoned. This is a deduction. In 
the same way we conclude that any horned animal, 
newly discovered, is a ruminant, because the general 
fact has been discovered by induction that horned 
animals are ruminant. Deduction, then, is reasoning 
from the general to the particular, while induction is 
reasoning from the-partioular to the general* 



Example. 

Reasoning from example is somewhat of the na- 
ture both of induction and deduction. In induction, we 
infer a general fact from a number of particular cases, 
but in the argument from 'example, we infer something 
in regard to one particular case from another case or 
oases. Thus we might infer that a certain traitor 
will come to a bad end because the traitor N&n&

came to a bad end. But perhaps there is 
something of the nature both of an induction and 
deduction here, it having been settled from the example 
of Nftnd R&o, that traitors generally come to a bad end ; 
hence, since this man is a traitor, he too will come to a 
bad end. The appstle Peter reasons by example 
[2 Peter 2, 4 :. 9,] when he refers to the destruction 
of the angels that sinned, and of the antediluvian world, 
and of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, to 
prove that the wicked shall be punished. This form 
of reasoning is very plain, and need not be further 

illustrated here* 

Analogy. 

1. Analogy, as commonly used, means resemblance, 
and the resemblance may be in the things themselves 
or in their uses and their relations. The earth and 
moon both being round and both revolving on their 
axes, is an example of "analogy in things themselves" 
The fin of a fish and the wing of a bird, being both 
used for propelling each animal in the medium where 
it lives, afford an example of analogy of "we." The 
capital of a country bears somewhat the same relation 
to that country as tho heart does to the body ; this is 
an analogy of "relation" 

Now in reasoning from analogy, we infer that 
because things resemble, in some known particulars, they 
will resemble in others. The strength of the argument 
of course will be in proportion to the strength of the 
resemblance. The following is an example of reason- 
ing from analogy* We see a great resemblance be- 
tween the earth where we live and Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn and other planets. They all seem to be com- 
posed of matter like the earth* They revolve around 
the sun and derive their light from him as the earth 
does. They revolve on their axes and hence must hav.0 
day and night like our earth. So in many partiou-

lars they resemble the earth. Now as the earth is in- 
habited, it is inferred that they are also. 



2. Reasoning from analogy resembles both in- 
duction and reasoning from example. It differs from 
induction thus ; 

In induction we reason from several cases or in- 
dividuals to the whole class, but in analogy we reason 
from one case to another. In induction we see that 
the several things are like each other, but in analogy 
the evidence is indirect and we infer that they are 
alike in some particular or particulars in question, 
because they are alike in others. Analogy differs from 
example in this, that in example we are supposed to 
$ee that the one case is like the other, the evidence 
being thus direct, while in analogy we see but in 
part and infer the rest from resemblance in what we 
do see. 

As another illustration of this form of argument, 
we may meet the objection against the Bible that it 
contains doctrines inexplicable by reason, by a refer- 
ence to the analogy between nature and revelation. 
Both are the work of the same infinite Being. In 
this they "are alike. Now as nature presents to us 
many inexplicable things, from analogy we may ex- 
pect that revelation also may contain things inexplica* 
ble. And we may further infer that as time and study 
remove many of the mysteries of nature, so it will be in 
regaxd to revelation ; as indeed we do find that time 



mglum hote hain ; sab aftab ke 6s pus gardish 
karte hain, aur us se roshni hdsil karte hain, jaise za- 
min k& hdl hai, aur jaise hamari zamin ke apne mih- 
war par ghumne se din aur rdt hote rahte hain, isi 
tarah un men bhi din aur rat hote rahte hain. Pas 
jab ham ne dekha, ki yih saiyare bahut baton men 
hamdri zamin se mushabahat rakhte hain, to qarine se 
ham natija nikalte hain, ki jaise zamin abad hai, waise 
we bhi dbad hain. 

2. Dalil i qarina, dalil i istiqra aur tam&il, donon 
se mushabahat rakhti hai, magar istiqra se mukh- 
talif is bdt men hai, ki istiqrd men juziyat se kulliyat 
par dalil lai jati hai, lekin qarine men ek bdt se dusri 
bat sabit ki jati hai. Istiqra men kai chizon ko ek 
dusre ke mushabih dekhkar natija nikald jdta hai, aur is 
men ek ohiz ko dusri chiz se chand bdton men musha- 
bahat dekhkar qarine se nikdl liya jatd hai, W. aur Mt- 
on men bhi mushdbih honge. Qarina tamsil se is bat 
men mukhtalif hai, ki tamsil men ek ohiz ko dusri ohiz 
se mushabih dekhkar ham dalil Idte hain ; lekin qarine 
men ek chiz ko dusri chiz se kuchh baton men musha- 
bih dekhkar qarine se matlum kar lete hain, ki baqi aur 
baton men bhi mushabahat rakhte hain. Is qism ki 
dalil k ek aur misal yih hai. Agar koi shakhs iatiraz 
kare, ki Baibal men aise masle hain, jo samajh men

and study often clear up apparent difficulties in God's 
word. 

3. Analogy ean always be reduced to the syllo* 
gistio form, as we see is the case with all reasoning. 
Thus suppose ,we find the skeleton of an animal we 
have never seen alive, and observe that it has sharp* 
teeth and claws like a tiger. From analogy we infer 
that this animal lived on prey, eating the flesh of other 
animals. The argument put in the syllogistic form 
would be, 

All animals with sharp teeth and claws prey on 

other animals. 

This animal has sharp teeth and claws. 
Therefore it preys oft other animals. 
Thus also the example just given on the Bible. 
The work of an infinite Being, as proved by 

nature, may contain things inexplicable by 

man. 

Revelation is the work of an infinite Being. 
Therefore revelation may contain some things 

inexplicable by man. 

4. Seasoning from analogy must be used with 
caution. * The evidence is indirect and is often liable 
to objection. There may be resemblance in some par- 
ticulars without resemblance in alL Thus, although 
the planets, as Mars, Jupiter and Saturn do resemble 
the earth in many particulars, we cannot infer with 
absolute certainly that they are in like manner inhab- 
ited. For in respect of temperature, water and the 
general conditions of life, these planets may not be 
like the earth, hence may be ineapable of supporting 
life. 

Some have supposed that because there is a re- 
semblance between the growth, decay, and death of 
vegetation and that of animal*, the latter perish entirely

like the former, and man with them. But this con- 
clusion is not warranted ; for animals are sentient, ac 
tive creatures in which plants do not resemble them. 
There. is. between the existence of each, such a wide 
difference that no one is justified, from faint resem- 
blances, in infering a like destruction. 

Hence analogy must be used with caution. If 
may generally be used as a strengthening and con- 
firming argument rather than as absolute proof. 

Reasoning "a priori" "apostcrwri" and "a for- 
tiori" The above names are used to designate par- 
ticular forms of argument, the manner and use of which 
we here explain. An argument is called, 



1. "A priori" when we infer effects from known 
causes, or when we deduce consequences from defini- 
tions formed or principles assumed. Thus from the 
existence of the cause we infer the. existence of the 
effect. For instance; if the sun has risen we know 
that it is day, because the sun, as a source of light, 
must produce day. If the moon has come between the 
sun and the earth there must be an eclipse, because 
such a conjunction of the sun, moon and earth would 
produce an eclipse as an effect. If we should hear 
that a man has been bitten by a mad dog, we would 
naturally infer that he will die from hydrophobia, 
Believing that God is a merciful, allwise and infimtly 
holy Ruler, we infer that his dealing with man will be 
marked by mercy and that he cannot be the author 
of sin. 

In mathematics we find many instances of "a 
priori' 9 reasoning, where from certain definitions or 
general principles, we infer certain results or deduce 
impossiWity of wrong assumption?. For instance

ke waste late hain, aisa kam hota hai, ki wuk bajae 
khud dalil ho. 

" Ittat se mqlul sdbit karna" aur " mnlul se illat 
mbit karnd," " adnd se aid ko sdbit karnd." Yih tinon 
dalil ki suraton ke nam hain. In suraton kd, aur un 
ke istiamal karne ke tariqe ka bay an ham yahan par 
likhte hain : 

1. "Illat se mahil sdbit karnd" us ko kahte 
hain, ki sababon i maluma se musabbab darydft 
kiye jawen, aur qawdid yd qawdnin i muqarrara 
se natdij nikdle jawen. Garaz ki wujud illat se 
wujud malul kd natija nikdlne ko " illat se mqlul sdbit 
karnd" kahte hain. Maslan jis waqt dftdb tulu hogd, 
ham jdnte hain ki din zarur hogd, kyiinki dftdb chash- 
ma roshni ka hai. Tulu hond aftab kd illat hai, jis se 
wujud malul kd, yane din kd hond sdbit hota hai. Yd 
agar ehdnd, dftdb aur zaniin ke darmiydn a jdwe, to

wuh shakhs kutte ki bimdri se mar gayd hai, Isi ta- 
rah jab ham ne jdnd, ki Khudd rahim aur karim, 
quddus o hakim i haqiqi hai, to ham natija nikalte 
hain, ki Khudd Tadld insdn par rahmat ki nazar rakhta

from the definition that parallel lines never meet, we 
may infer, in any demonstration, that two certain lines 
cannot meet, because they are parallel; or because they 
have met, we infer that they are not parallel. So 
on we infer numerous other results or conclusions. And 
\ve reason in the same way in all sciences. 



2. Eeasoning "a posteriori" is just the reverse of 
"a priori" reasoning. In this, causes are deduced from 
effects. For instance, from the round shadow of the 
earth on the moon in a lunar eclipse we infer that the 
earth is round. We reason that a round shadow as an 
effect must come from a round substance as cause. 

Familiar examples of reasoning "a posteriori" are 
found in cases where, from effects produced, we try to 
find out their cause. In cases of murder, often the 
cause and manner of death are thus traced up and the 
murderer detected. 

By reasoning "a posteriori," we infer the exist- 
ence and attributes of God from our own existence and 
the existence of nature and manifestations of design 
and goodness, &a, around us. Thus also, from the 
sublime teachings and superhuman spirit of the Bible, 
we infer that it has a divine author. In the same 
way, from* the evil tendency of a book, claimed to be 
inspired, we might infer that it is simply * human 
production. 

This kind of reasoning should be used with cau- 
tion. An inference should not be drawn till some 
clear relation of effect and cause is established, other- 
wise the error of "non causa pro causa" will be com-

observed here. 



3. "A fortiori" is a form of argument in which, 
from an admitted case or proposition, we proceed to 
prove another case of the same nature, for the accept- 
ance of which, the reasons seem even stronger than 

for the admitted case. 

The form of the argument is, 

A is equal to B. 

C is greater than A. 

Therefore C is greater than B. 
Christ reasoned thus with his disciples and others 
in many instances. For example (Mat. vi, 28, 30,) 
" And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the 
lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither 
do they spin, and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in 
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass-of the field, which 
to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall, he 
not much more clothe you, ye of little faith?" 

This put into the form of a syllogism would stand 
thus, 

The lilies and grass of the field are clothed by 
God. 

You are much greater than they. 

Much more will you be clothed by God. 
Again: "And behold there was a man which had 
his hand withered. And they asked him saying is it 
lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might 
accuse him. And he said unto them what man shall 
there be among you that shall have one sheep, and if 
it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay

kisi amr yd dawa e musallama se, usi qism ke kisi aur 
amr, ya dawe ko sdbit karte hain. Aur jo aimr ya 
dawa ki sdbit kiydjatahai,u^ko taslim karne ke waste 
us se bhi barh kar subut hote hain, jitiia ki us amr ya 
djiLwd e musallama ke subut ke liye hote hain. Yih 
diJfl is surat ki hoti hai, 

A. barabar hai B. ke. 
J. A. se bard hai. 

Pas J. B. se bard hai. 

Masih apne shagirdon, aur, aur logos te sdth bar- 
hd is qism ki dalil lay a. Maslan (dekho Mati 6 : 28-30.) 
" Aur poshak ki kyun fikr karte ho, jangli sosan ko 
dekho, kaise barhte hain, wuh na mihnat karte n a 
katte hain. Par main tnmhen kahtd huij, ki Sulaimiin 
bhi apni sari shdn 9 shaukat men un men se ek ki rna-

jo dj hai, aur kal tanur men jhonki jdti, yun pahimita hai, 
to kya turn ko ai sust-iatiqddo, ziyddann. pahinawegd P" 
Agar yih dalil ba surat i qiyas qdim ki jawe, to 
yun hogi : 

Jangli sosan aur ghds ko poshdk di. 
Turn un se bahut bare ho. 

Pas tumko bdhut ziijada poshdk Khuda bakhshegd. 

Dusri misdl, (Mati 12: 10-12.) "Aur dekho, 

wahdn ek shakhs thd, jis ka hdth sukh gayd tha. Tab 

unhon ne is irdde se, ki us par ndlish karen, us se pu- 

ohhd, ki Kyd sabt ko din changa karna rawa hai ? Us

hold on it and lift it out P How much then is a man 
letter than a sheep P Wherefore it is lawful to do well 
on the sabbath days." [Mat. xii: 10, 12.] 

This then is the argument " a fortiori" in which 
we reason from a less obvious but admitted proposition 
to one with stronger reasons for its adoption. 



Recapitulation. 

An argument according to the mode of its reason- 
ing may be : 

1. Inductive. 
2. Deductive. 
3. By example. 
4. By analogy. 
5. A priori. 
6. A posteriori. 
7. A fortiori

hain.

CONCLUSION. 

We have now gone over the subject of Logic and 
it only remain^ to add a word by way of conclusion. 
The entire subject of Logic, as taught, has been pre- 
sented in these pages. The student need not be per- 
plexed by the pretensions of any one who may , by way 
of magnifying his own learning, claim that the subject 
has not been fully treated in this book, being too vast 
to be comprehended in a volume of this size. The 
sum and substance of true logic, as taught by the 
ancients and moderns, is presented in this book. If it 
be mastered, a knowledge of this science, as far as it 
may be gained from a book, will be obtained. The 
works on logic found in this country should be studied 
in order to be familiar with the different modes of 
treating the subject and with the various terminology 
and phraseology in use, 

But the learner must not imagine that the mere 
reading of any book or number of books on logic, how- 
ever complete, will make him a logician. If this book 
be thrown aside when read, or even when its terms 
rules and phraseology is memorized and the subject 
be left there, the learner will not be a logician. "Prac- 
tice makes perfect" in every science and art. It is 
the daily use of tools that makes the artisan a skillful 
workman after he has learned what is taught in books. 
Thus also an application must be made of the science 
of logic, before one can earn a just reputation as a 
logician. The principles, terminology, and rules of the 
science should be well understood, and then an effort 
should be made to practice correct reasoning in every 
day life. An effort should be 'made to detect and

name our own, and the errors of others. We should 
accustom ourselves to scrutinize the arguments oral 
or written which we meet. Their form and strength 
or weakness should be observed. Models of correct 
and powerful reasoning when met with should be 
studied. In this way, some true claim may be earned 
to the title of Logician. Such a course cannot fail to 
have a very beneficial effect on the mind, in the marked 
improvement of the reasoning faculties. To specify, 
greater clearness of thought will be gained. Through 
want of clearness in thought men are apt to impose on 
themselves and others. Where the mind is properly 
trained by the study of logic, thought is much clearer 
in the comprehension and expression of truth than it 
can be without this study. The faculties are also 
quicker in the detection and exposure of error. Again, 
by the course recommended in this study, greater 
mental strength will be gained. When not properly 
trained, the mind is feeble and uncertain in the pur- 
suit of truth, and wavering in its grasp of what is 
obtained. The study of logic trains the mind to a

more vigorous pursuit and firmer grasp of truth. 
Finally, the course recommended will give greater 
beauty to the mind. The mind of man is the noblest 
creation of Grod with which we are acquainted. But 
what is more pitiable than a mind full of ignorance 
and wandering in error, and what is more beautiful than 
a mind built up in strength and symmetry, and radiant 
with truth ! One of the most powerful aids to secure 
all these results is the study of Logic.
