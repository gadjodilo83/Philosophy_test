LIBRARY    OF    PHILOSOPHY 

As  may  bV  seen  from  the  original  programme  printed  in 
Erdmann's  History  of  Philosophy  under  the  date  1890,  the 
Library  of  Philosophy  was  designed  as  a  contribution  to  the 
History  of  Modern  Philosophy  under  the  heads:  first  of 
different  Schools  of  Thought — Sensationalist,  Realist,  Idealist, 
Intuitivist ;  secondly  of  different  Subjects — Psychology,  Ethics, 
Aesthetics,  Political  Philosophy,  Theology.  While  much  had 
been  done  in  England  in  tracing  the  course  of  evolution  in 
nature,  history,  economics,  morals  and  religion,  little  had 
been  done  in  tracing  the  development  of  thought  on  these 
subjects.  Yet  'the  evolution  of  opinion  is  part  of  the  whole 
evolution'. 

By  the  co-operation  of  different  writers  in  carrying  out  this 
plan  it  was  hoped  that  a  thoroughness  and  completeness  of 
treatment,  otherwise  unattainable,  might  be  secured.  It  was 
believed  also  that  from  writers  mainly  British  and  American 
fuller  consideration  of  English  Philosophy  than  it  had  hitherto 
received  might  be  looked  for.  In  the  earlier  series  of  books 
containing,  among  others,  Bosanquet's  History  of  /Esthetic, 
Pfleiderer's  Rational  Theology  since  Kant,  Albee's  History  of 
English  Utilitarianism,  Bonar's  Philosophy  and  Political  Eco- 
nomy, Brett's  History  of  Psychology,  Ritchie's  Natural  Rights, 
these  objects  were  to  a  large  extent  effected. 

In  the  meantime  original  work  of  a  high  order  was  being 
produced  both  in  England  and  America  by  such  writers  as 
Bradley,  Stout,  Bertrand  Russell,  Baldwin,  Urban,  Montague 
and  others,  and  a  new  interest  in  foreign  works,  German, 


French  and  Italian,  which  had  either  become  classical  or  were 
attracting  public  attention,  had  developed.  The  scope  of  the 
Library  thus  became  extended  into  something  more  inter- 
national, and  it  is  entering  on  the  fifth  decade  of  its  existence 
in  the  hope  that  it  may  contribute  in  this  highest  field  pf 
thought  to  that  Intellectual  Co-operation  which  is  one  of  the 
most  significant  objects  of  the  League  of  Nations  and  kindred 
organizations.

'The  writings  of  the  illustrious  sage  of  Koenigsberg,  the  founder 
of  the  Critical  Philosophy,  more  than  any  other  work,  at  once  in- 
vigorated and  disciplined  my  understanding.  The  originality,  the 
depth,  and  the  compression  of  the  thoughts ;  the  novelty  and  subtlety,

PREFACE 

IT  is  a  scandal  to  philosophical  scholarship,  and  not  least 
to  German  philosophical  scholarship,  that,  more  than  a  hundred 
and  fifty  years  after  the  publication  of  the  Kritik  of  Pure 
Reason,  we  still  lack  a  commentary  comparable  with  such 
works  as  that  of  Pacius  on  the  Organon  of  Aristotle  or  even 
that  of  Adam  on  the  Republic  of  Plato.  Of  all  the  authors  who 
write  about  Kant's  greatest  work  there  is  none  who  condescends 
to  explain  it  sentence  by  sentence :  Hans  Vaihinger,  who  alone 
set  out  to  do  so,  attempted  to  write  a  commentary,  not  only 
upon  the  Kritiky  but  upon  all  its  previous  commentators; 
and,  as  was    but   natural,  he  gave  up  this  impossible  task 
when  he  had  proceeded  but  a  little  way.  In  the  absence  of 
a  detailed  commentary  we  have  an  inevitable  welter  of  con- 
flicting opinions  about  Kant's  doctrines.  More  serious  still,  the 
unfortunate  student  and  even,  if  I  may  judge  from  my  own 
experience,  many  teachers  of  philosophy  have  the  vaguest 
idea  as  to  the  meaning  of  Kant's  words.  There  are  sentences 
in  which  the  reader  is  unable  to  decide  to  which  of  several 
nouns   the    relative   and    demonstrative   pronouns   refer,  or 
which  of  two  nouns  is  to  be  regarded  as  subject  and  which 
as  object.  In  vain  do  we  look  for  a  reliable  guide  even  in 
these  elementary  matters;  and  the  plain  fact  is  that  most 
students  find  many  passages,  and  too  often  crucial  passages, 
to  which  they  can  attach  no  meaning  at  all.  It  is  not  surprising 
that  they  accept  the  opinions  of  others  at  second-hand  without 
being  able  either  to  confirm  or  to  criticise  them. 

It  is  not  my  aim  to  write  a  commentary  of  the  type  required : 
this  is  a  task  which  should  be  reserved  to  a  German  writing 
for  Germans.  Nevertheless  where  the  language  is  most  difficult, 
and  especially  in  such  passages  as  the  Transcendental  Deduc- 


i6  PREFACE 

tion  and  the  argument  of  the  Analogies,  I  have  attempted 
to  analyse  Kant's  thought  almost  sentence  by  sentence;  and 
everywhere  I  have  sought  to  give  chapter  and  verse  for  my 
interpretations,  so  that  the  reader  may  be  able  to  make  an 
independent  estimate  of  their  truth. 

A  method  of  this  kind  is  not  without  its  disadvantages. 
If  difficulties  are  dealt  with  in  detail,  the  explanation  is  bound 
itself  to  be  difficult;  yet  it  must  be  remembered  that  a  commen- 
tary on  the  Kritik,  by  the  very  nature  of  its  subject  matter, 
cannot  be  light  reading;  and  its  usefulness  must  depend  on 
the  extent  to  which  it  explains  real  difficulties,  or  at  the  very 
least  explains  where  the  real  difficulties  lie.  Again,  if  this 
method  is  followed,  Kant's  many  expositions  of  the  Trans- 
cendental Deduction  must  impose  a  good  deal  of  repetition 
on  the  commentator;  but  there  is  no  way  of  understanding 
the  argument  except  by  studying  its  details;  and  any  reader 
who  believes  he  has  mastered  the  details  can  confine  his  atten- 
tion to  Chapters  XXX  and  XXXI,  where  I  set  out  my  general 
interpretation  and  criticisms.  The  chief  disadvantage  is  not, 
I  think,  either  the  inevitable  concentration  on  difficulties  or 
the  occasional  repetitions,  but  the  real  danger  that  in  the 
mass  of  minor  problems  the  reader  may  fail  to  see  the  main 
lines  of  the  argument.  I  can  only  say  that  I  believe  Kant's 
doctrine  to  be  a  whole,  and  humanly  speaking  a  consistent 
whole;  and  I  have  sought  throughout  to  interpret  the  details 
as  elements  in  such  a  whole.  I  might  have  attempted  merely 
to  expound  my  own  view  of  his  central  doctrine;  but  unsup- 
ported by  details  it  could  not  be  expected  to  carry  conviction, 
and  in  any  case  my  primary  aim  is  not  to  advocate  a  particular 
theory,  but  rather  to  place  the  student  in  such  a  position 
that  he  can  set  aside  the  theories  of  others  and  read  Kant 
intelligently  for  himself. 

Every  commentator  must  see  his  author  from  his  own 


PREFACE  17 

point  of  view  and  subject  to  his  own  limitations,  but  his 
business,  as  I  understand  it,  is  to  explain  what  the  author 
has  said,  and  not  what  he  ought  to  have  said.  I  am  aware 
that  two  of  the  most  interesting  interpreters  of  Kant  in 
this  country — Edward  Caird  and  Professor  Prichard — bave 
adopted  a  different  policy;  yet  I  cannot  help  thinking  that 
they  would  have  served  us  even  better,  if  each  of  them  had 
written  two  books,  one  to  expound  his  own  philosophy  and 
another  to  expound  the  philosophy  of  Kant.  The  commentator 
must  indeed  tell  us  honestly  when  he  finds  an  argument  to 
be  unintelligible  or  fallacious;  but  beyond  that  he  need  not 
go.  Criticism,  in  short,  should  be  subsidiary  to  exegesis. 

If  the  critic  finds  the  whole  argument  to  be  unintelligible 
or  fallacious,  only  very  special  circumstances  can  justify  him 
in  writing  a  commentary  at  all.  On  the  other  hand,  if  he 
professes  to  find  intelligible  an  argument  which  he  manifestly 
does  not  understand,  he  can  have  no  justification  in  any 
circumstances.  Nevertheless  he  can  be  expected  to  exhibit 
the  intelligibility  of  his  author  only  within  certain  limits: 
he  cannot  be  asked  to  meet  all  possible  criticisms  or  to  expound 
his  author  in  the  terms  of  current  philosophical  controversy. 
For  my  own  part  I  believe  Kant's  argument  to  be  intelligible, 
though  I  do  not  profess  to  understand  all  its  ramifications. 
I  have  sought  to  expound  his  doctrine  in  his  own  terminology, 
since  I  am  convinced  it  is  only  by  becoming  familiar  with 
his  terms  that  we  can  follow  his  argument.  I  am  content  if 
I  can  enable  the  reader  to  see  the  plausibility  of  the  Critical 
doctrine,  and  so  help  him  to  assess  its  truth  and  to  estimate 
the  value  of  the  criticisms  to  which  it  has  been  subjected.  It 
is  from  no  disrespect  to  such  writers  as  Professor  Prichard 
that  I  have  not  attempted  to  discuss  the  ultimate  questions 
which  they  have  raised  in  regard  to  the  theory  of  knowledge. 
I  am  far  from  claiming  that  Kant's  doctrine  is  the  final  truth 


i8  PREFACE 

in  these  difficult  matters,  but  I  am  sure  it  contains  far  more 
truth  than  is  commonly  believed,  and  I  suspect  that  it  contains 
more  truth  than  many  modern  philosophies.  Unless  I  con- 
sidered Kant's  doctrine  to  be  of  permanent  importance,  I 
should  feel  that  I  was  wasting  my  time  in  writing  about  it 
at  such  length.  A  book  of  the  type  I  have  now  written,  if 
I  could  have  read  it  when  first  I  began  the  study  of  Kant, 
would  have  saved  me  from  endless  misunderstanding  and 
much  unnecessary  labour;  and  I  hope  that  I  may  have  done 
something  to  make  further  progress  more  easy  for  my 
successors.  Although  I  have  confined  myself  to  the  finst  half 
of  the  Kritik,  I  hold,  as  Kant  did,  that  this  is  intelligible  in 
itself.  When  it  is  thoroughly  mastered,  the  rest  of  the  argument 
should  offer  no  insuperable  difficulty. 

I  will  not  attempt  to  acknowledge  my  obligations  to  previous 
writers  on  Kant.  To  do  so  would  be  to  give  a  critical  summary 
of  what  is  called  'Kantliteratur*  the  value  of  which  is  by 
no  means  proportionate  to  its  bulk.  As  in  duty  bound,  I  have 
made  myself  acquainted,  in  a  greater  or  less  degree,  with 
all  the  English  works  on  this  subject  and  with  most  of  the 
standard  works  in  German.  It  is  impossible  for  me  to  remember 
from  whom  I  may  have  originally  derived  a  particular  inter- 
pretation, although  I  have  made  occasional  acknowledgements 
in  the  body  of  the  text.  If  the  truth  must  be  told,  I  feel 
compelled  to  say  with  H.  J.  de  Vleeschauwer,1  one  of  the  best 
of  modern  writers  on  Kant,  that  I  have  found  much  of  this 
literature  'inutile  ou,  ce  qui  est  plus  grave,  trompeuse.'  In  any 
case,  as  is  not  surprising,  I  have  learned  that  Kant  himself 
is  incomparably  his  own  best  commentator;  and  I  have  sought 
throughout  to  rid  myself  of  the  theories  of  others  and  to 

1  Le  deduction  transcendentale,  tome  I,  p.  26.  It  is  my  loss  that  I 
discovered  this  work  only  recently — it  was  published  in  1934 — and 
that  the  second  volume,  which  will  consider  the  actual  text,  is  not 
yet  to  hand. 


PREFACE  19 

see  his  doctrine,  so  far  as  I  may,  through  his  own  eyes.  No 
one  who  understands  the  difficulty  of  this  undertaking  will 
expect,  at  the  present  stage  of  Kantian  scholarship,  to  find 
a  work  free  from  errors,  free  even  from  serious  errors.  But 
there  is  one  error  I  have  never  committed:  I  have  never 
thought  that  any  part  of  Kant's  philosophy — I  know  nothing 
about  his  science — could  justly  be  regarded  as  negligible. 

For  my  translations  I  alone  am  responsible;  but  I  have 
had  before  me  the  version  of  Professor  Kemp  Smith,  and 
I  hope  that  those  who  read  Kant  in  English  will  have  no 
difficulty  in  taking  up  my  references.  On  very  few  occasions 
I  have  felt  obliged  to  differ  expressly  from  Mr.  Kemp  Smith's 
translations.  It  must  not  be  thought  from  this  that  I  fail  to 
appreciate  the  services  he  has  rendered  in  this  field.  He  has 
given  us,  for  the  first  time,  an  English  translation  which 
those  who  are  unfortunately  innocent  of  German  may  study 
with  some  hope  of  being  able  to  follow  the  argument  as  Kant 
intended  it.  I  am  the  more  glad  to  acknowledge  these  services, 
because  my  own  interpretation  of  the  Kritik  differs  toto  coelo 
from  his,  and  because  in  view  of  the  wide  acceptance  of  his 
doctrines  I  may  at  times  have  expressed  my  disagreement 
with  undue  vehemence. 

My  references  to  Kant's  works  are,  I  think,  self-explanatory. 
The  first  and  second  editions  of  the  Kritik  are  referred  to 
as  A  and  B,  and  the  original  paging  is  given.  The  references 
in  brackets  are  to  the  volume  and  page  of  the  Berlin  edition 
of  Kant's  works.  Kant's  lectures  on  Metaphysics  (edited  by 
Schmidt)  I  refer  to  as  Metaphysik. 

Perhaps  I  should  offer  an  apology  for  using  such  a  phrase 
as  'Kritik  of  Pure  Reason'  Having  always  disliked  the  word 
'Critique'  (whose  French  associations  seem  so  alien  to  Kant), 
I  yet  lacked  courage  to  revive  the  old  English  form  'Critick' 
and  fell  back  upon  a  hybrid  usage,  the  enormity  of  which  I 


20  PREFACE 

did   not   grasp   until   too   late.   For  this   I  can   make   no 
defence. 

It  only  remains  to  offer  thanks  for  the  various  forms  of 
help  that  I  have  received. 

My  thanks  are  due  especially  to  the  Court  of  the  University 
of  Glasgow  for  the  six  months'  leave  granted  me  in  1932 
in  order  to  prosecute  my  work  on  Kant.  During  that  period 
I  completed  the  first  draft  of  my  book,  and  without  such 
leave  I  doubt  whether  I  should  have  been  able  to  do  so.  My 
belief  is  that  an  extension  of  the  American  system  of  sabbatical 
years  to  the  British  universities  would  do  more  than  afiything 
else  to  increase  the  output  of  scholarly  works  in  this  country. 
I  am  particularly  grateful  that  in  this  way  I  have  been  enabled 
to  carry  on  the  tradition  of  Kantian  scholarship  which  is 
one  of  the  glories  of  the  University  of  Glasgow. 

I  must  express  my  most  grateful  thanks  to  Mr.  H.  Barker 
(of  the  University  of  Edinburgh),  and  to  Mr.  D.  R.  Cousin 
and  Miss  M.  J.  Levett,  my  colleagues  in  the  department  of 
Logic,  all  of  whom  read  the  first  draft  of  my  book  and  offered 
criticisms  which  have  saved  me  from  many  pitfalls;  to 
Dr.  Heinrich  Cassirer  for  help  in  regard  to  the  German  text ; 
to  Professor  J.  H.  Muirhead  for  reading  the  final  version  in 
typescript  and  for  making  valuable  suggestions ;  to  Miss  Lilian 
Mattingly  for  typing  so  much  of  my  not  too  legible  hand- 
writing; to  my  colleagues  Mr.  George  Brown  and  Mr.  D.  R. 
Cousin  for  help  in  the  correcting  of  proofs ;  to  Miss  Ursula 
Todd-Naylor  for  compiling  the  general  index;  and  to  Miss 
Elizabeth  Laughland  for  checking  some  of  my  many  refer- 
ences and  for  compiling  the  index  of  annotated  passages.

CHAPTER    I 
INTRODUCTION 

§  i.  Kant  and  his  Critics 

It  is  pn  irony  of  fate  that  Immanuel  Kant,  who  declared 
the  Kritik  of  Pure  Reason  to  be  intelligible  only  to  those  who 
understood  it  as  a  whole,  should  be  beset  by  commentators 
who  maintain  that  there  is  no  whole  to  understand. 

The  contrast  between  the  two  contentions  is  striking.  It 
seems  hardly  possible  to  find  a  middle  way  between  them. 
On  the  one  hand  we  have  the  doctrine,  widely  accepted  to-day, 
that  the  Kritik  is  a  mosaic  of  passages  dating  from  different 
times  and  externally  connected  with  one  another,  so  that  in 
the  words  of  a  distinguished  modern  commentator  Kant 
'flatly  contradicts  himself  in  almost  every  chapter'.1  On  the 
other  hand  we  have  Kant's  indignant  repudiation  of  such 
a  view.  'In  every  writing,  above  all  when  it  proceeds  as  a 
free  discussion,  it  is  possible  to  ferret  out  apparent  contra- 
dictions, by  comparing  together  isolated  pages  torn  from 
their  context.  Such  apparent  contradictions  cast  a  prejudicial 
light  upon  it  in  the  eyes  of  those  who  depend  upon  criticism 
at  second  hand,  but  they  can  be  easily  solved  by  any  one 
who  has  mastered  the  idea  as  a  whole'.2  Of  this  Kant  was 
so  convinced  that  he  wrote  the  Prolegomena  only  in  order 
that  he  might  help  his  readers  to  master  the  idea  as  a  whole.3 
He  thought  that  when  he  had  done  so,  the  difficulty  of  under- 
standing him  would  disappear,  and  that  those  who  still  found 
him  unintelligible  would  be  well  advised  to  employ  their

talents  in  sciences  other  than  metaphysics,  a  subject  which 
after  all  it  is  not  necessary  that  everybody  should  study. 

§  2.  The  Patchwork  Theory 

That  the  Kritik  is  a  mosaic  or  patchwork  is  supposed  to 
be  obvious  throughout,  but  to  be  specially  obvious  in  the 
Transcendental  Deduction  as  set  forth  in  the  first  edition. 
This  Deduction  has  been  analysed  into  a  large  number  of 
separate  strata  both  by  Professor  Adickes  and  by  Professor 
Vaihinger.  It  seems  to  cause  no  qualms  that  parts  regarded 
as  late  by  the  former  are  asserted  by  the  latter  to  be  early, 
and  vice  versa. 

In  this  matter  there  are  naturally  differences  of  degree. 
Adickes,  in  his  edition  of  the  Kritik,  has  propounded  the 
theory  that  Kant's  procedure  was  to  insert  passages  into  an 
original  nucleus.  This  theory  he  has  worked  out  in  detail 
for  the  whole  book.  I  believe  his  general  view  to  be  unproved, 
although  not  unreasonable,  and  his  account  of  the  details  to 
be  hazardous  and  even  fanciful.  Nevertheless  although  he  is 
prepared  to  speak  of  the  Kritik  as  a  mosaic,  it  would  be  a 
mistake  to  attribute  to  him  the  patchwork  theory  in  its  extreme 
form.  For  that  we  must  go  to  Vaihinger,  who  has  dealt  in 
full  detail  only  with  the  Transcendental  Deduction.1  Vaihinger's 
view  of  the  Deduction  has  been  made  familiar  to  English 
readers  in  the  Commentary  of  Professor  Kemp  Smith  f  and 
it  is  this  view  which  I  have  in  mind  when  I  speak  of  the 
patchwork  theory,  although  some  of  my  criticisms  apply  to 
the  view  of  Adickes  also. 

I  have  dealt  with  Vaihinger's  theory  more  fully  elsewhere,3 
and  can  here  express  only  a  dogmatic  and  summary  opinion. 

In  his  argument  Vaihinger  ignores  two  fundamental  facts, 

1  Die  Transcendentale  Deduktion  der  Kategorien  (Niemeyer,  Halle, 


2  Professor  Kemp  Smith  generally  follows  the  divisions  of  Adickes 
elsewhere,  and  it  is  difficult  to  reconcile  this  attitude  with  his  com- 
plete abandonment  of  Adickes  in  favour  of  Vaihinger,  when  he  deals 
with  the  Transcendental  Deduction.

I  §2]  INTRODUCTION  39 

both  clearly  stated  by  Kant,  (i)  that  the  Deduction  has  two 
sides,  an  objective  and  a  subjective,  and  (2)  that  it  contains 
two  expositions,  a  provisional  and  a  systematic.  He  then 
chooses  one  test,  and  one  only,1  which  is,  roughly,  the  account 
given  of  imagination ;  and  by  means  of  this  test  he  goes  over 
the  Deduction  as  with  a  comb.  Since  imagination  is  to  be  found 
only  on  the  subjective  side  of  the  Deduction,  one  expects 
first  of  all  that  this  method  will  divide  up  the  Deduction 
into  a  subjective  and  an  objective  deduction.  This  is  what 
actually  happens.  One  expects  also  to  find  two  objective 
deductions  (a  provisional  and  a  systematic),  and  two  subjective 
deductions  (a  provisional  and  a  systematic) — four  in  all.  We 
do  get  a  provisional  and  a  systematic  subjective  deduction; 
but  owing  to  the  fact  that  in  the  systematic  exposition  the 
subjective  and  objective  sides  are  closely  combined,  the  whole 
of  the  systematic  exposition  is  regarded  by  Vaihinger  as  one 
stratum.  In  the  provisional  exposition,  on  the  other  hand, 
points  which  should  be  conjoined  are  dealt  with  in  separation 
(a  fact  to  which  Kant  himself  draws  attention),  and  this 
enables  Vaihinger  to  extract  from  it  two  objective  deductions, 
so  that  our  expectations  are  not  wholly  disappointed.  Having 
decided  that  the  subjective  deduction  is  late  and  the  objective 
deduction  early,  he  concludes  that  the  provisional  subjective 
deduction  is  very  late,  and  one  of  the  provisional  objective 
deductions  very  early.  Thus  he  gets  four  strata,  and  the 
ingenuousness  of  his  method  is  concealed  from  himself  and 
his  readers  by  the  fact  that  he  can,  not  unnaturally,  find 
elsewhere  preparatory  passages  which  will  fit  in  with  this 
classification.  With  amazing  self-confidence  he  proceeds  to 
divide  up  these  main  strata  into  substrata,  which  he  affects 
to  put  in  a  temporal  order  regarded  as  at  least  probable. 
Finally  he  examines,  on  the  same  principles,  some  of  Kant's 
loose  jottings  (at  that  time  almost  entirely  undated),  and 
succeeds,  as  is  only  to  be  expected,  in  discovering  passages 

1  'das  einzige  und  entscheidende  Unterscheidungsprinzip.'  This 
admission  itself  seems  to  me  enough  to  put  the  whole  theory  out  of 
court. 


Ao  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  3 

which  he  can  fit  into  his  four  strata.  This  he  regards  as  a 
confirmation  of  his  argument. 

To  my  mind  the  whole  discussion  is  a  monument  of  wasted 
ingenuity,  rendered  the  more  pathetic  by  the  learning  and 
clarity  of  the  exposition. 

§  3.  Extreme  and  Moderate  Views 

No  one  need  deny  that  Kant's  mind,  like  that  of  other 
philosophers,  worked  on  different  levels;  that  he  thought  out 
some  problems  more  fully  than  others;  and  that  he  was 
capable  of  solving  one  problem  without  at  first  realising  all 
its  implications  in  relation  to  other  problems.  Nor  need  one 
deny  that  the  notes  which  he  had  by  him  as  he  brought  the 
Kritik  into  its  final  form  were  on  different  levels  of  reflexion, 
and  may  have  influenced  the  Kritik  as  we  have  it  to-day. 
I  think  myself  that  the  inequalities  in  Kant's  thought  have 
been  grotesquely  exaggerated,  and  I  see  no  reason  to  suppose 
that  he  ever  made  use  of  any  notes  without  that  re-writing 
which  is  mentioned  in  the  account  of  his  method  given  by 
Borowski.1  I  do  not  wish,  however,  to  argue  either  of  these 
points,  and  I  recognise  that  here  there  may  well  be  differences 
of  opinion.  What  I  wish  to  protest  against  is  the  doctrine 
that  Kant  took  isolated  and  contradictory  notes,  dating  from 
different  periods,  and  joined  them  together  in  a  purely  external 
manner.  If  there  are  any  who  think  that  this  description 
exaggerates  the  doctrine  of  Vaihinger,  I  can  only  ask  them  to 
re-read  what  he  has  written  in  his  monograph  on  the  Trans- 
cendental Deduction.2 

I  venture  to  hold  both  that  the  general  theory  of  Vaihinger 
is  incredible  and  that  its  detailed  application  is  demonstrably 
false.  The  finding  of  contradictions  in  Kant  had  become 
with  him  almost  an  obsession.3  This  is  seen  to  some  extent 
even  in  his  Commentary,  which  derives  its  immense  value 

1  (IV  579).  2  See  especially  pp.  2  (—  24)  and  24  (=  46).

'Vaihinger  practises  the  cult  of  contradiction  in  a  way  which  works 
to  death  a  principle  in  itself  justifiable.  He  creates  contradictions 
without  reason/ 


I  §  3]  INTRODUCTION  41 

from  his  erudition  and  power  of  analysis  rather  than  from 
his  capacity  to  enter  into  another  man's  mind.1  When  he 
passes  to  the  more  subtle  task  of  literary  criticism,  to  the 
consideration  of  Kant's  method  of  composition,  his  weakness 
shows  itself  in  the  crudest  possible  form. 

It  is  not  my  experience  of  the  human  mind  that  inconsis- 
tencies of  thought  and  expression  are  always,  or  even  generally, 
due  to  differences  in  the  date  of  writing.  Nevertheless  this 
is  a  possible  explanation,  and  it  may  be  held  in  a  reasonable 
form,  especially  when  we  are  considering  a  work  of  great 
length  like  the  Kritik.  What  so  many  people  fail  to  realise 
is  the  immense  gap  between  holding  such  a  general  theory 
and  attempting  to  determine  on  this  basis  the  order  in  which 
the  work  was  composed.  Where  the  general  theory  is  pro- 
pounded in  a  more  or  less  reasonable  way,  as  it  is  by  Adickes, 
there  is  plenty  of  room  for  extravagance  in  the  working  out 
of  the  details.  Even  Vaihinger  is  able  to  recognise  that  Adickes' 
account  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  is  'highly  artificial', 
'like  a  system  of  cycles  and  epicycles';  and  I  am  content  to 
repeat  his  criticism.2  It  is  sufficient  to  say  that  Adickes  dis- 
tinguishes seven  different  deductions,  in  almost  every  one 
of  which  he  finds  interpolations  from  the  others,  and  these 
interpolations  have  themselves  further  interpolations  as  well 
as  'harmonising  passages'  intended  to  give  an  appearance  of 
unity  to  the  whole.  In  detail,  as  well  as  in  principle,  Adickes' 
account  seems  to  me  less  unreasonable  than  that  of  Vaihinger ; 
but  I  can  only  stand  amazed  at  his  audacity  in  the  application 
of  a  method  which  depends  entirely  on  internal  evidence 
and  is  by  its  very  nature  dubious  and  uncertain. 

It  must  be  remembered  that  the  burden  of  proof  lies  not 
upon  those  who  treat  the  Kritik  as  the  unitary  work  which 
it  professes  to  be,  but  upon  those  who  claim  to  distinguish 
the  different  strata  of  which  it  is  composed.  If  I  attempted 

1  Adickes  takes  the  same  view  (op.  cit.,  p.  57),  and  even  applies 
to  Vaihinger  the  lines

42  INTRODUCTION  [I  §4 

to  refute  in  detail  the  complicated  and  conflicting  theories 
of  Vaihinger  and  Adickes,  I  should  only  distract  attention 
from  the  doctrines  of  Kant,  which  it  is  my  purpose  to  expound. 
It  will  be  a  sufficient  refutation  of  the  patchwork  theory  in 
its  extreme  form,  if  it  can  be  shown  that  the  Kritik,  and 
especially  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  is  an  argument — 
not  necessarily  a  valid  argument,  and  certainly  not  a  clear 
argument,  but  one  which  might  be  set  forth  by  an  able  thinker 
breaking  new  and  difficult  ground.  That,  to  the  best  of  my 
ability,  is  what  I  hope  to  do. 

§  4.  Consequences  of  the  Patchwork  Theory 

This  question  cannot  be  regarded  as  a  biographical  problem 
of  no  importance,  since  it  has  serious  consequences  both  for 
teaching  and  for  exposition. 

The  youthful  mind  is  too  intelligent  to  suppose  that  a 
work  composed  in  this  casual  way  is  worth  the  immense 
labour  which  is  necessary  to  understand  it;  and  it  will  not 
be  deceived  for  long  by  the  encomia  pronounced  on  the 
advantages  of  combining  so  many  contradictory  doctrines 
within  the  compass  of  a  single  work.  If  the  patchwork  theory 
is  true,  the  study  of  the  Kritik  ought  to  be  removed  from  the 
philosophical  curricula  of  the  universities. 

For  exposition  the  consequences  seem  to  me  even  more 
serious.  It  is  not  merely  that  the  theory,  so  far  from  shedding 
light  on  the  obscurities  of  Kant,  shrouds  them  in  impenetrable 
gloom.  To  my  mind  it  makes  further  criticism  impossible. 

The  essence  of  criticism,  and  the  only  way  in  which  we 
can  penetrate  more  deeply  into  the  mind  of  an  author,  is 
to  check  our  interpretation  of  one  passage  in  the  light  of 
another,  until  gradually  the  whole  becomes  clear.1  If  our 
interpretation  is  contradicted  by  other  passages,  we  are 
compelled  to  reconsider  it,  and  so  we  may  come  nearer  the 
truth.  On  the  patchwork  theory  there  is  no  such  compulsion, 

1  Adickes  (Kant  und  die  Als-ob-Philosophie,  pp.  10  ff.)  has  some 
wise  words  on  this  subject. 


I  §  5]  INTRODUCTION  43 

and  the  way  is  open  for  purely  subjective  impressions.1  Indeed 
if  an  interpretation  is  contradicted  by  what  Kant  says  else- 
where, the  commentator  merely  notes  a  further  confirmation 
of  the  patchwork  theory;  and  the  number  of  contradictions 
which  he  can  find  is  limited  only  by  his  capacity  for  mis- 
understanding Kant. 

Another  unfortunate,  but  inevitable,  consequence  of  the 
theory  is  the  atmosphere  of  condescension  with  which  the 
name  of  Kant  is  now  surrounded.  This  is  most  conspicuous, 
not  in  Kant's  professed  opponents,  but  in  those  who  claim 
to  set  forth  the  meaning  and  worth  of  the  Critical  Philosophy. 
Well  might  Kant  apply  to  himself  the  expression  he  puts 
into  the  mouth  of  Leibniz:  *I  can  defend  myself  against  my 
enemies,  but  God  save  me  from  my  friends/2 

§  5.  Kant's  Own  View  of  the  Kritik 

The  patchwork  theory  is  an  attempt — although,  in  my 
opinion,  a  mistaken  attempt — to  solve  a  real  problem,  the 
problem  of  the  Kritik's  difficulty  and  obscurity.  This  has 
been  a  continuous  subject  of  complaint  from  the  time  of 
publication  until  now. 

On  this  matter  the  opinion  of  Kant  himself  is  at  least  worthy 
of  being  examined.  He  fears  that  his  attempt  to  solve  the 
problem  of  Hume  will  meet  with  the  same  fate  which — in 
spite  of  the  subtlety  and  attractiveness  of  Hume's  style — 
greeted  the  original  statement  of  it.  It  will  be  wrongly  criticised, 
because  it  is  misunderstood;  and  it  will  be  misunderstood 
because,  though  people  may  be  prepared  to  read  the  pages 
through,  they  will  not  take  the  trouble  to  think  the  thought 
through.  And  the  reason  why  they  will  not  take  this  trouble 

1  Kemp  Smith,  for  example,  habitually  distinguishes  what  he  calls 
'the  true  Critical  teaching*  from  the  doctrines  propounded  by  Kant. 
Even  the  fact  that  the  doctrine  of  pure  intuition  is  consistently  held 
by  Kant  and  regarded  by  him  'as  an  integral  part  of  his  system  does 
not,  of  course,  suffice  to  render  it  genuinely  Critical'    (see  Commen- 
tary, p.  40 — the  italics  are  mine).

in  the  case  of  the  Kritik  is  that  the  work  is  dry,  obscure, 
diffuse,  and  contrary  to  all  accepted  ideas.1 

For  its  dryness  Kant  does  not  think  he  need  apologise, 
at  any  rate  to  philosophers.  He  does  not  claim  to  possess 
the  stylistic  gifts  of  a  Hume  or  a  Mendelssohn,  but  he  believes 
that  he  could  have  made  the  Kritik  a  more  popular  work 
had  he  been  willing  to  sacrifice  thoroughness  to  popularity. 
The  necessity  for  thoroughness  is  imposed  upon  him — be  it 
noted — by  the  necessarily  organic  character  of  a  Kritik  of 
Pure  Reason,  such  that  every  part  depends  upon  the  adequate 
treatment  of  every  other  part.  The  difficulties  which  many 
found  even  in  the  Prolegomena  made  him  less  confident  of 
his  capacity  for  lucid  exposition,2  but  there  is  jio  doubt  that 
the  dryness  of  his  style  was  a  matter  of  deliberate  choice, 
as  he  explains  in  the  first  edition.3  He  preferred  the  scholastic 
to  the  popular  style,  because  if  he  had  enriched  his  argument 
with  illustrations  and  examples,  its  length — and  it  is  long 
enough  in  any  case — would  have  made  it  difficult  for  the 
reader  to  grasp  the  argument  as  a  whole.  His  choice  is  made 
in  the  interests  of  science,4  and  it  is  of  fundamental  importance 
that  he  should  not  seem  to  persuade  the  reader  by  rhetoric 
instead  of  convincing  him  by  argument.5  This  is  a  subject 
upon  which  he  has  long  reflected,  and  he  is  certainly  not 
inventing  excuses  to  explain  an  unexpected  failure.6 

The  diffuseness7  of  the  work  he  seems  to  regard .  partly 
as  a  weakness  of  his  own,  but  mainly  as  imposed  upon  him 
by  the  nature  of  his  subject,  by  the  necessity  of  entering  into 
many  details  if  the  exposition  is  to  be  an  organic  whole.  So 
far  as  it  belongs  to  the  nature  of  the  subject,  he  regards  it 
as  an  actual  advantage  to  his  argument,  although  a  disadvantage

ness  and  intricacy ;  the  suggestion  of  verbosity  is  secondary,  and  may 
not  be  implied  by  Kant  at  all.  Compare  A  98. 


I  §  5]  INTRODUCTION  45 

to  his  book.  He  admits,  however,  that  it  is  a  source  of  obscurity, 
since  the  reader  finds  it  difficult  to  grasp  the  main  points  in 
the  argument,  and  so  to  get  a  comprehensive  idea  of  the  whole. 

On  this  matter  Kant  is  precisely  right,  and  the  difficulty 
is  at  least  partly  due,  as  he  suggests,  to  his  method  of  exposition. 
Especially  to  the  beginner,  the  Kritik  appears  as  an  endless 
string  of  equally  difficult,  and  for  all  he  knows  equally 
important,  sentences ;  so  that  the  main  turning  points  of  the 
argument,  and  the  crucial  sentences  which  demand  special 
scrutiny,  are  lost  to  him.  With  more  attention  to  the  method 
of  exposition  this  could  have  been  avoided. 

To  more  fundamental  complaints  of  obscurity  Kant  is  not 
sympathetic.  He  even  says,  somewhat  unkindly,  that  com- 
plaints of  obscurity  are  often  merely  a  covering  for  the  laziness 
or  incompetence  of  the  critic ;  and  he  hopes  that  his  obscurity 
may  help  to  prevent  the  ignorant  from  talking  confidently 
about  problems  in  metaphysics,  as  they  would  never  dare 
to  do  in  other  sciences.1  He  is  prepared  to  admit,  however, 
that  the  many  misunderstandings  into  which  even  acute 
thinkers  have  fallen  are  'not  perhaps  without  his  fault';2  yet 
the  deficiencies  which  he  admits  belong  only  to  the  method 
of  exposition,  and  not  at  all  to  the  system  or  the  arguments 
he  has  expounded. 

To  what  does  Kant  ascribe  these  defects  of  exposition  ?  To 
the  fact  that  although  the  Kritik  was  the  product  of  twelve 
years'  reflexion,  it  was  composed3 — I  use  the  word  in  a  neutral 
sense — hurriedly  in  four  or  five  months,  with  the  greatest 
attention  to  the  content,  but  with  little  care  for  the  method 
of  exposition.4  The  statement  that  it  was  composed  in  four 
or  five  months  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  it  was  entirely 
re-written,  although  a  parallel  statement5  that  it  'was  brought 
to  paper  in  its  present  form  in  only  a  short  time'  distinctly

suggests  re-writing,  and  tends  to  confirm  Borowski's  account 
of  Kant's  usual  procedure.  It  would,  however,  be  more  than 
surprising  if  'the  greatest  attention  to  the  content*  had  not 
disclosed  to  Kant  the  glaring  contradictions  alleged  by 
Vaihinger.1 

What  was  the  reason  for  Kant's  haste  and  for  his  neglect 
of  considerations  of  style  ?  A  very  good  one,  which  he  repeats 
again  and  again.2  He  was  beginning  to  grow  old,  and  he  had 
all  the  rest  of  the  Critical  Philosophy  still  to  expound.  With 
amazing  industry  he  poured  out  in  the  next  few  years  an 
immense  mass  of  Critical  writings,  but  even  so  his  system 
was  not  completed,  and  his  last  great  work,  now  known  as 
the  Opus  Postumumy  had  to  be  left  unfinished. 

Kant's  excuse  is  more  than  adequate.  If  he  had  attempted 
to  write  as  some  people  would  have  liked  him  to  write,  the 
Critical  Philosophy  would  never  have  been  published  at  all. 

§  6.  The  Novelty  of  Kant's  Doctrine 

Kant  is  willing  to  admit  that  some  of  the  alleged  difficulty 
and  obscurity  of  his  writing  is  due  to  defects  of  exposition, 
but  he  believes  that  it  is  mainly  due  to  the  novelty  of  his  theories, 
to  the  fact  that  they  contradict  accepted  ideas.3  This  is  the 
point  in  which  he  compares  his  own  experience  to  that  of 
Hume,  whose  critics,  he  believes,  consistently  failed  to  under- 
stand what  he  was  trying  to  say.4 

Kant  has  no  use  for  those  philosophers  whose  only  philosophy 
is  the  history  of  philosophy,  and  who  are  therefore  opposed 
to  all  new  ideas,  although  they  maintain  that  these  new  ideas 
have  all  been  expressed  before.5  Such  philosophers  ought  by 
now  to  be  on  Kant's  side,  and  perhaps  to  a  certain  extent 

1  Note  also  that  in  a  letter  to  Herz  of  the  same  period  (X  252) 
Kant  says  that  the  Kritik  is  the  first  of  his  works  in  which  there  was 
nothing  that  he  wanted  to  alter  (apart  from  a  few  additions  and 
explanations).  Yet  his  earlier  works  have  not  so  far  been  exhibited 
as  a  mass  of  contradictions.  For  a  description  of  Kant's  method  of 
scrutiny,  see  another  letter  to  Herz  (X  127).

they  are.  But  this  advantage,  if  it  be  an  advantage,  is  more 
than  counterbalanced  by  the  fact  that  so  much  of  Kant's 
terminology,  which  at  the  time  had  an  accepted  and  precise 
meaning,  has  been  forgotten.  Even  a  slight  acquaintance 
with  the  writings  of  Baumgarten  and  G.  F.  Meier,  and 
especially  with  Kant's  own  lectures  on  Logic  and  on  Anthro- 
pology, is  a  great  help  for  the  study  of  the  Kritik;  and  in  its 
absence  many  points  seem  obscure  and  pedantic  which  at 
the  time  must  have  been  regarded  as  obvious. 

In  the  main  Kant's  views  are  still  as  paradoxical,  and  as 
contrary  to  accepted  ideas,  as  they  were  when  they  were 
written*.  It  is  still  possible  to  approach  Kant's  works  with 
prejudices — whether  well-  or  ill-grounded  makes  little  difference 
— and  to  suppose  that  one  can  criticise  his  arguments  on  the 
basis  of  a  knowledge  which  one  believes  oneself  to  possess, 
although  it  is  precisely  this  knowledge  which  Kant  wishes 
to  call  in  question.  If  we  do  so,  he  maintains,  we  shall  make 
no  progress.  We  shall  see  in  the  Kritik  only  what  we  already 
know,  because  the  words  in  which  it  is  expressed  are  similar 
to  those  we  commonly  use;  but  everything  in  it  will  seem 
utterly  distorted  and  nonsensical,  it  will  appear  to  be  written 
in  a  sort  of  double  Dutch.  And  the  reason  for  this  will  be 
that  we  are  reading  our  own  thoughts  into  it,  and  not  following 
the  thought  of  the  author.1 

I  believe  that  in  this  we  are  getting  nearer  to  the  deeper 
reasons  for  the  seeming  obscurity  of  Kant.  Not  indeed  that 
we  can  ascribe  that  obscurity,  by  a  sort  of  Copernican  revolu- 
tion, entirely,  or  even  mainly,  to  the  prejudices  of  his  critics 
and  their  unwillingness,  or  incapacity,  to  attain  an  inside 
view  of  his  philosophy.  The  main  explanation  lies  in  the  fact 
that  the  Kritik  is  opening  up  a  world  of  altogether  new  ideas ; 
that  Kant  is  undertaking  the  most  difficult  task  ever  under- 
taken on  behalf  of  metaphysics;2  and  that  the  human  mind 
does  not,  in  an  enterprise  of  this  kind,  detect  at  first  the 
shortest  path  towards  its  goal.3  Kant  has  had  a  new  vision

48  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  7 

of  reality,  and  in  such  a  vision  there  must  always  be  difficulty 
for  those  to  whom  it  is  imparted,  and  an  element  of  struggle 
and  effort  even  for  the  seer  himself.1 

§  7.  Novelty  and  Obscurity 

Philosophy  is  a  study  to  which  many  different  types  of 
mind  contribute,  and  all  of  these  may  have  their  own  value. 
The  gift  of  clarity — a  great  gift — may  belong  to  many  of  these 
types  of  mind ;  but  I  do  not  think  it  will  be  maintained  that 
the  clearest  minds  are  always  the  most  profound  or  the  most 
far-seeing.  Clarity  may  be  found  even  in  those  thinkers, 
despised  by  Kant,  whose  philosophy  is  the  history  of  philosophy. 
It  is  to  be  found  still  more  often  in  what  may  be  called 
analysts,2  acute  expositors,  and  often  destructive  critics,  of 
the  works  of  other  men.  In  more  positive  and  original  thinkers 
it  is  to  be  found  in  those  whose  work  is  confined  within  a 
narrow  sphere,  or  in  those  who,  accepting  certain  premises, 
work  out  their  consequences,  as  Berkeley  and  Hume  worked 
out  the  consequences  of  the  premises  laid  down  by  Locke. 
Perhaps  it  is  to  be  found  at  its  best  in  those  creative  thinkers 
who  adopt  a  semi-mathematical  method  and,  having  laid  down 
a  number  of  self-evident  principles,  attempt  to  build  upon 
them  the  fabric  of  truth,  laying,  as  it  were,  one  brick  upon 
another,  after  the  most  scrupulous  attention  both  to  the  thought 
and  to  its  expression.  Such  methods,  however,  from  their 
very  nature  are  incapable  of  covering  adequately  the  whole 
field  of  human  thought;  and  I  doubt  whether  this  kind  of 
clarity  is  to  be  found  in  the  philosophers  who  advance,  or 
revolutionise,  thinking  in  every  department  of  philosophy. 

We  have  among  us  all  these  types  of  mind  at  the  present 
time.  There  is,  I  think,  a  general  insistence  upon  the  need 
for  clarity,  and  a  reaction  against  what  seem  to  us  to  be  the 
too  facile  solutions,  and  too  hurriedly  comprehensive  systems, 

1  Compare  B  XLI V,  where  Kant  speaks  of  obscurities  in  the  Kritik, 
which  at  the  beginning  are  hardly  to  be  avoided.  This  may,  however, 
refer  only  to  readers,  and  especially  to  readers  who  have  not  yet 
been  able  to  study  the  whole  system  of  the  Critical  Philosophy. 

2  This  is  how  Kant  describes  Baumgarten  (B  35  n.). 


I  §  8]  INTRODUCTION  49 

of  the  past  generation.  Yet  while  we  have  many  clear  writers, 
the  thinkers  who  make  the  most  serious  attempts  to  gather 
together  the  different  strands  of  human  knowledge,  and  to 
work  out  their  consequences  in  all  branches  of  philosophy, 
are  precisely  the  thinkers  who  are  most  commonly  charged 
with  obscurity.  Professor  Whitehead,  for  example,  finds  it 
necessary  to  invent  a  new  vocabulary  for  the  expression  of 
his  thought;  and  he  is  rebuked  by  his  former  followers  for 
falling  into  contradictions  and  for  giving  up  the  clear  distinc- 
tions which  he  found  sufficient  at  an  earlier  stage  of  his 
reflexions.  Professor  Alexander  is  content  in  the  main  to 
use  the  accepted  vocabulary  of  philosophy,  but  even  his 
charming  and  persuasive  style  does  not  prevent  his  doctrine 
from  seeming,  to  many  of  us,  both  difficult  and  obscure. 

This  phenomenon — which  is  to  be  found  equally  in  music 
and  in  art — ought  not  to  surprise  us,  when  we  find  it  in 
philosophy.  When  a  man  explores  unknown  countries,  we 
do  not  blame  him  on  his  return  because  his  maps  are  inferior 
to  the  ordnance  survey  of  England.  We  have  to  remember 
that  whatever  Kant  is  doing  he  is  certainly  exploring  new 
paths.  We  must  expect  that  the  account  of  his  explorations 
will  be  strange  to  untravelled  minds,  and  even  that  it  may 
contain  gaps  and  deficiencies  which  a  longer  residence  in 
those  parts  might  remedy.  It  is  unreasonable  to  demand  that 
a  new  philosophy  should  come  before  us,  armed  at  all  points, 
like  a  mathematical  treatise.1 

§  8.  The  Reasons  for  Kanfs  Obscurity 

The  obscurity  to  be  found  in  Kant  has  been  greatly 
exaggerated.  As  a  writer  he  is  very  much  clearer  than  most 
of  his  critics;  and  many  of  the  alleged  contradictions  exist 
only  in  their  imagination,  and  are  due  to  misunderstandings 
for  which  Kant  is  not  to  be  held  responsible.2  What  obscurity 

1  B  XLIV.  Cassirer,  Kant's  Leben  und  Lehre,  Chapter  III  (Berlin 
1923),  has  an  admirable  discussion  of  the  whole  subject. 

1  It  is  astonishing,  for  example,  how  his  clear  statement  about  the 
Copernican  revolution  has  been  misunderstood.  See  BXVI ;  BXXIIn. ; 
Kemp  Smith,  Commentary,  pp.  22  ff. ;  and  compare  Chapter  III  §  i. 


50  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  9 

there  is,  is  to  be  found  chiefly  in  the  passages — such  as  the 
Transcendental  Deduction  and  the  Analogies — where  Kant 
is  breaking  with  tradition  and  trying  to  establish  his  revolu- 
tionary views.  We  need  no  far-fetched  explanation  of  this. 
Kant's  obscurity,  where  genuine,  is  sufficiently  explained  by 
two  facts,  firstly  that  the  Kritik  was  composed  in  a  hurry, 
and  secondly  that  the  problems  investigated  were  as  difficult 
as  they  were  novel.1 

§  9.  Kanfs  Use  of  Language 

The  more  serious  source  of  obscurity,  the  novelty  and 
difficulty  of  his  theme,  I  need  not  discuss  further;  but  some- 
thing must  be  said  about  the  effects  of  haste  upon  his  use 
of  language. 

We  know  that  Kant  took  little  trouble  in  regard  to  proof- 
reading, and  apparently  he  did  not  even  see  some  of  the  proofs 
of  the  first  edition.2  Corrections  noted  by  him  in  the  first 
edition  he  fails  to  insert  in  the  second  edition.  When  he  does 
make  corrections  in  the  text  of  the  second  edition,  he  fails 
to  carry  them  out  consistently.3  If  one  remembers  the  difficulty 
of  the  subject,  one  must  believe  that  some  obscurities  are 
probably  due  to  the  printer.  Others  may  be  due  to  the  fact 
that  Kant  made  changes  in  his  manuscript  and  failed  to 
see  to  it  that  the  necessary  readjustments  were  completed. 

A  more  fruitful  source  of  obscurity  is  carelessness^  in  the 
use  of  language.  The  Kritik  proceeds  as  a  free  discourse,4  a 
dialogue  of  the  soul  with  itself,  and  if  we  expect  that  the  same 
word  is  always  to  be  used  in  precisely  the  same  sense,  we  shall 
certainly  be  disappointed. 

Thus,  for  example,  the  word  'object'  is  used  by  Kant  in 
at  least  four  senses.  It  is  used  for  the  thing  as  it  is  in  itself, 

1  It  is  possible  that  some  of  Kant's  obscurity  is  due  to  the  fact 
that  he  is  in  error,  but  that  hypothesis  must  be  the  conclusion  of 
an  argument — not  a  principle  of  exegesis.  2  A  XXI-XXII. 

8  See,  for  example,  B  25  =  A  11-12 ;  B  29-30  ==  A  15-16. 

4  B  XLIV.  It  may  be  observed  that  in  hurried  writing  of  this 
type  we  expect  to  find  repetitions — the  great  stumbling-block  to 
some  of  the  commentators. 


I  §9]  INTRODUCTION  51 

and  for  the  thing  as  it  appears  to  us;  or,  in  more  technical 
language,  it  is  used  for  the  thing-in-itself  and  for  the  phe- 
nomenal object.1  Furthermore  the  phenomenal  object  is 
itself  composed  of  a  matter  given  to  sense  and  a  form  imposed 
by  thought;  and  each  of  these  is  called  by  Kant  the  object, 
the  former  the  indeterminate  object,  or  the  object  as  appearance, 
the  latter  the  object  in  general.  Hence  he  is  capable  of  saying 
that  the  object  is  not  known,  and  that  the  object  must  be 
known;  and  again  that  the  object  is  given  to  us  apart  from 
thought,  and  that  there  is  no  object  apart  from  thought. 

To  a  microscopic  critic  guided  only  by  the  letter  of  the 
text  these  contradictions  are  insoluble.  Yet  it  is  obvious  that 
such  verbal  contradictions  may  take  place  without  any  confusion 
in  the  mind  of  the  writer.  He  expects  us  to  judge  from  the 
context  which  particular  sense  of  'object'  is  meant,  even 
although  at  times  it  may  not  be  possible  for  us  to  do  so  with 
certainty. 

I  do  not  defend  these  carelessnesses  of  expression,  nor  do 
I  maintain  that  the  contradictions  are  always  merely  verbal; 
but  I  do  assert  that,  with  the  exercise  of  a  little  intelligence 
and  good  will,  many  of  the  alleged  contradictions  will  disappear. 

There  is  another  point  which  must  always  be  remembered. 
Kant  held  that  in  philosophy  definitions  should  come  at  the 
end,  rather  than  at  the  beginning.2  Some  philosophers  deny 
this,  but  even  they  ought  to  recognise  that  Kant  has  chosen 
to  express  his  thought  in  a  way  different  from  theirs.  He  is 
not  stating  the  results  of  his  thought,  or  building  up  a  system 
upon  certain  definitions.  He  is  rather  thinking  aloud,  and 
asking  us  to  share  in  the  conversation.  To  change  the  metaphor 
— we  must  do  our  best  to  follow  him  up  the  steep  and  thorny 
way  of  the  Kritik?  and  then  consider  whether  we  can  see 
the  wide  prospect  which  he  claims  to  see.  If  we  insist  on  each 
step  being  justified  before  we  take  the  next,  we  shall  never 
see  anything. 

1  See  B  XVIII-XIXn.,  where  Kant  argues  that  these  are  the  same 
object  considered  from  different  points  of  view.

52  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  10 

§  10.  Some  Reservations 

The  general  position  for  which  I  stand  is  that  such 
obscurities  and  contradictions  as  there  are  in  the  Kritik  can 
be  explained  without  any  reference  to  the  patchwork  theory. 
I  do  so,  however,  subject  to  certain  reservations. 

In  the  first  place  I  am  speaking  only  of  the  Aesthetic  and 
Analytic,  though  I  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  I  should 
take  a  different  view  of  the  Dialectic. 

In  the  second  place,  quite  apart  from  the  patchwork  theory, 
there  is  a  wide  consensus  of  opinion  that  the  Aesthetic  was 
written  at  an  earlier  period  than  the  Analytic,  or  at  any  rate 
expresses  an  earlier  level  of  thought  inconsistent  with  that 
of  the  Analytic. 

Such  a  hypothesis  seems  to  me  a  tenable  hypothesis,  and 
in  face  of  the  immense  authority  behind  it,  I  hesitate  to  reject 
it.  Kant  certainly  speaks,  throughout  the  Aesthetic,  as  it  the 
object  could  be  given  to  sense  by  itself,  and  he  says  nothing 
of  the  activity  of  thought  which,  in  the  Analytic,  he  insists 
is  necessary  for  knowledge  of  an  object  in  the  full  sense.  The 
reason  for  this  may  conceivably  be  that  he  is  too  shortsighted, 
to  see  what  is  coming,  or  that  he  used  an  earlier  doctrine1 
without  realising  its  full  inconsistency  with  the  central  doctrine 
of  the  Kritik.  I  cannot,  however,  conceal  my  own  belief, 
unpopular  at  the  moment  though  it  be,  that  this  seeming 
inconsistency  in  Kant  is  due  to  the  fact  that  he  is  top  long- 
sighted, and  expects  his  readers  to  be  longsighted  also.  At 
the  very  outset  he  says  that  in  the  Aesthetic  he  proposes  to 
isolate  sensibility,  and  to  take  away  from  it  everything  that 
the  understanding  thinks.2  And  what  he  says  he  will  do, 
that  he  does.  There  is  hardly  a  breath  of  the  work  of  under- 
standing in  the  Aesthetic;  and  Kant,  I  believe,  expects  his 
readers  to  remember,  through  a  long  and  complicated  argu- 
ment, that  everything  is  in  a  sense  provisional  and  is  to  be 

1  The  doctrine  of  the  Dissertation.  One  point  against  this  view  is 
that  there  are  marked  differences  between  the  Aesthetic  and  the 
Dissertation.

reinterpreted  in  the  light  of  what  comes  later.  I  think  that 
a  hint  or  two  to  that  effect  would  have  been  a  help,  and  that 
he  ought  not  to  have  reserved  its  clear  statement  for  a  foot- 
note to  the  Analytic  in  the  second  edition.1 

There  is  one  other  passage  which  as  a  whole  I  am  prepared 
to  consider  as  possibly  written  at  an  earlier  date,  and  as 
expressing  an  earlier  level  of  thought.  That  passage  is  what 
I  have  called  the  provisional  exposition  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction.2  Its  doctrine  of  imagination  is  undoubtedly  inconsis- 
tent with  the  doctrine  expressed  elsewhere.  If  it  is  taken  as 
early,8  we  have  an  intelligible  evolution  of  Kant's  thought 
from  a  less  satisfactory  to  a  more  satisfactory  view,  and  it 
is  understandable  that  Kant  should  retain  the  earlier  version 
as  showing  the  road  by  which  he  had  travelled.  This,  however, 
I  regard  as  an  uncertain  hypothesis.  All  we  can  be  said  to 
know  is  that  Kant  considered  the  passage  a  suitable  preparation 
for  his  systematic  exposition.4 

An  admission  of  the  kind  I  have  made  gives  us  no  warrant 
for  supposing  that  Kant  was  capable  of  overlooking  flagrant 
contradictions  in  different  expositions  of  his  theory.  In  this 
case  he  need  not  be  unaware  of  the  contradictions.  His  aware- 
ness of  the  contradictions  may  be  the  reason  why  he  warns 
the  reader  that  the  whole  passage  is  to  prepare  rather  than 
to  instruct  him. 

Subject  to  these  reservations,  I  see  no  reason  to  regard 
the  Kritik  as  other  than  a  unitary  work.  In  so  saying  I  do 
not  mean  to  express  any  opinion  as  to  the  method  of  its 
composition ;  for  on  this  subject  we  have  no  adequate  evidence. 
Still  less  do  I  mean  to  deny  the  presence  in  it  of  repetitions, 
obscurities,  inequalities,  and  inconsistencies.  I  mean  that  the 
only  hope  of  understanding  the  Kritik  lies  in  treating  it  as

a  A  98- 1 1 4.  Adickes  shows  more  understanding  of  this  than 
Vaihinger. 

8  Vaihinger  takes  the  first  part  of  it  as  late.  I  would  add  that  the 
researches  of  de  Vleeschauwer  (La  deduction  transcendentale)  have 
shown  conclusively  that  this  part  cannot  be  very  early.  4  A  98. 


54  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  n 

a  whole  and  trying  to  fit  its  different  parts  together.1 1  believe 
that  this  method  of  treatment  is  not  made  impossible  by 
such  inconsistencies  as  are  to  be  found  in  Kant;  and  I  am 
quite  sure  that  beginners  in  Kant  ought  to  be  given  some 
view,  even  if  partly  mistaken,  of  the  doctrine  as  a  whole  before 
being  plunged  into  modern  expositions  of  its  alleged  unending 
contradictions. 

§  ii.  Kant's  Claim 

As  will  be  obvious  from  this  discussion,  Kant  himself 
was  fully  convinced  that  his  Kritik  is  a  unitary  work.  Indeed 
for  him  it  is  so  much  a  unitary  work  that  to  change  even 
the  smallest  part  of  it  would  give  rise  to  contradictions,  not 
merely  in  the  system,  but  in  human  reason  itself  !2  This  state- 
ment, it  must  be  remembered,  he  makes  after  having  had  the 
advantage  of  hearing  what  the  critics  had  to  say  about  it. 

I  shall  be  told,  no  doubt,  that  a  man  is  not  always  the  best 
judge  of  his  own  work.  The  commentators  are  wont  to  quote 
Kant's  own  dictum  about  Plato,  that  it  is  often  possible  to 
understand  an  author  better  than  he  understands  himself.3 
Whether  even  Kant  really  understood  Plato  better  then  Plato 
understood  himself  is  a  matter  on  which  there  may  be  two 
opinions;  but  even  if  he  did,  that  does  not  justify  us  in 
supposing  that  lesser  men  can  understand  Kant  better  than 
he  did  himself.  I  have  no  desire  to  suggest  that  Kant  was  a 
demi-god  incapable  of  error,  but  I  think  that  he  knew  very 
well  what  he  was  about. 

Another  thing  I  shall  expect  to  be  told  is  that  Kant's  insis- 
tence on  the  unity  of  his  work  is  merely  another  example  of 
his  devotion  to  'architectonic',  an  artificial  and  external  plan 
imposed  upon  his  exposition  because  of  a  desire  to  make  it 
conform  to  the  divisions  of  Formal  Logic.  This  assertion 
seems  to  me  at  the  best  to  be  only  a  half-truth.  I  do  not  deny 

1  I  believe  also  that  Kant  is  in  the  main  right  in  saying  that  the 
changes  made  in  the  second  edition  concern  the  method  of  exposition 
rather  than  the  substance  of  the  doctrine.  See  B  XXXVII  ff. 

2  B  XXXVIII.  3  A  314-6370. 


I  §  12]  INTRODUCTION  55 

that  the  Formal  Logic  on  which  Kant  based  so  much  of  his 
argument  has  been  superseded ;  nor  do  I  deny  that  he  ought 
to  have  seen  the  necessity  for  reconsidering  his  presuppositions. 
Nevertheless  there  is  no  part  of  Kant's  doctrine  which  has, 
in  my  opinion,  been  more  grossly  misunderstood  than  his 
theory  of  Formal  Logic  and  its  relation  to  Transcendental 
Logic.  If  we  can  remove  some  of  these  misunderstandings, 
and  above  all  if  we  can  place  Kant  in  his  historical  setting, 
I  believe  that  much  which  has  been  ascribed  to  an  irrational 
pedantry  and  a  muddleheaded  love  of  architectonic  will  be 
seen  in  a  very  different  light.  I  believe  also  that  a  proper 
understanding  even  of  Kant's  errors  will  enable  us  to  grasp 
more  clearly  the  unity  of  his  thought. 

§  12.  Kant  as  a  Thinker 

There  is  much  in  Kant,  much  even  in  the  first  half  of  the 
Kritik,  which  is  still  to  me  personally  dark  and  difficult. 
Nevertheless  many  passages  which  at  one  time  were  obscure 
to  me  have,  with  further  study,  become  clear;  and  I  think 
that  I  have  discovered  the  meaning  of  some  arguments  which 
have  been  widely  misunderstood.  This  has  encouraged  me 
to  believe  that  other  difficulties  are  in  principle  soluble,  and 
I  am  convinced  that  the  prevailing  view  of  Kant  in  this  country 
fails  to  do  justice  to  him.  The  confused  and  pedantic  thinker 
portrayed  by  some  commentators  seems  hardly  the  sort  of 
person  to  set  all  Germany  in  a  philosophical  ferment  and 
to  initiate  a  series  of  movements  whose  repercussions  in  other 
countries  are  far  from  having  ceased  even  at  the  present  time. 
It  is  possible  to  look  upon  all  these  movements  as  misguided, 
and  I  suppose  this  is  what  Mr.  Bertrand  Russell  means  by 
calling  Kant  *a  misfortune':  yet  to  say  this  is  not  to  deny 
Kant  some  elements  of  greatness;  for  to  be  a  misfortune  in 
modern  philosophy  must  require  considerable  gifts,  even  if 
they  are  of  a  non-philosophical  kind.  If  we  regard  Kant — 
to  put  it  at  its  lowest — as  the  Mrs.  Eddy  of  philosophy,  the 
nature  of  his  influence  would  still  require  to  be  explained; 
and  its  source  is  not  to  be  found  merely  in  his  moral  fervour, 


56  INTRODUCTION  [I  §  12 

and  still  less  in  his  gifts  of  rhetoric.  I  believe  myself  that  if 
we  can  penetrate,  even  imperfectly,  into  the  argument  of 
the  Kritiky  we  shall  find  something  other  than  a  pedantic 
old  professor,  armed  with  an  external  architectonic,  incompe- 
tently tacking  together  old  notes  of  what  he  used  to  think. 
We  shall  find  a  powerful  and  penetrating  intellect  struggling 
and  twisting  relentlessly  towards  its  goal.

KANT'S  PROBLEM 


CHAPTER    II 
APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY 

§  i .  Primary  and  Secondary  Qualities 

According  to  Kant,  the  world  which  we  know  fills  space,  and 
lasts  through  time,  and  is  composed  of  permanent  substances 
acting  upon  one  another  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  cause 
and  effect.  This  world  is  common  to  all  human  beings  and  is 
explored  by  science:  yet  it  is  a  world,  not  of  things  as  they  are 
in  themselves,  but  only  of  things  as  they  appear  to  us;  or,  in 
Kant's  language,  a  world  of  phenomena  or  appearances. 

By  this  Kant  does  not  mean  that  things  as  they  appear  to  us 
exist  only  at  the  moment  when  they  are  perceived,  or  that 
everything  is  what  it  appears  to  be  at  the  moment.  He  distin- 
guishes— as  we  all  must — between  the  time-order  of  our  sensa- 
tions and  the  time-order  of  objective  events :  the  back  and  the 
front  of  a  house,  for  example,  exist  at  the  same  time,  although 
I  can  never  see  them  at  the  same  time.  There  is  an  objective 
world1  which  we  seek  to  know,  and  which  must  be  distinguished 
from  the  subjective  series  of  sensations  and  thoughts  by  which 
we  seek  to  know  it. 

For  common  sense  this  objective  world  is  composed  of 
things-in-themselves ;  that  is,  of  things  which  are  what  they 
are  independently  of  our  sensations  and  our  thoughts,  and 
indeed  independently  of  the  constitution  of  the  human  mind. 
When  we  do  not  fall  into  error,  we  know  things  as  they  really 
are,  and  as  they  still  would  be,  if  there  were  no  minds  to  know 
them.  A  billiard  ball  is  red  and  hard  and  smooth  and  spherical. 
All  these  characteristics  it  possesses  in  itself,  and  we  do  not 
make  them  or  contribute  to  them:  we  merely  discover  them. 

1  This  world  is  called  'objective*,  since  it  is  an  object  common  to 
all  men;  whereas  my  sensations  or  thoughts  are  'subjective' — they 
belong  to  me  and  to  nobody  else.  This  distinction  is  provisional  and 
requires  further  analysis.  There  is  a  sense  in  which  even  my  sen- 
sations and  thoughts  form  part  of  the  one  phenomenal  world,  and 
they  can  be  known,  though  not  directly  intuited,  by  other  people. 


60  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  i 

This  common-sense  view  is  difficult  to  uphold  on  reflexion; 
and  it  has  long  been  a  wide-spread  belief  among  philosophers 
and  scientists  that  the  billiard  ball  possesses  in  itself  only  the 
primary  qualities  (size,  shape,  motion  etc.).  The  secondary 
qualities,  such  as  colour  and  sound,  are  supposed  to  result 
when  the  sense-organs  of  living  bodies  are  affected  by  the 
primary  qualities,  particularly  by  motion.  On  this  view  the 
world  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves  is  characterised  only 
by  the  primary  qualities:1  the  secondary  qualities  are  mere 
appearance. 

This  doctrine  has  been  forced  upon  men's  minds  by  the 
success  of  the  sciences,  and  especially  of  physics,  during  the 
last  three  centuries.  Kant  accepts  it,2  so  far  as  he  holds  that 
the  primary  qualities  are  the  same  for  all  men,  while  secondary 
qualities  may  be  different  for  different  men.  At  times  he  speaks 
as  if  the  secondary  qualities  were  purely  subjective,  and  could 
in  no  sense  be  attributed  to  objects.  At  other  times  he  recog- 
nises that  the  colour  and  the  scent  of  the  rose  can  be  attributed 
to  the  object  in  relation  to  our  senses?  He  affirms  on  the  other 
hand,  not  only  that  primary  qualities  are  objective,  but  even  that 
physics,  from  its  own  point  of  view,  is  justified  in  treating  the 
rainbow  as  a  mere  appearance  and  in  regarding  the  physical 
drops  of  rain  (with  their  primary  qualities)  as  things-in- 
themselves.4 

His  own  Critical  doctrine,  however,  is  that  we  must  dis- 
tinguish, not  two  things,  but  three:  (i)  the  secondary  qualities, 
which  depend  on  our  individual  sense-organs  and  on  our 
position  in  space ;  (2)  the  primary  qualities,  which  are  objective 
and  common  to  all  men,  but  which  nevertheless  depend  on  the 
constitution  of  the  human  mind,  although  not  on  our  indivi- 

1  The   primary   qualities   are   not   the   apparent  size,   shape,   and 
motion  (which  vary  with  our  different  sense-organs  and  our  different 
positions  in  space);  they  are  determinable  by  scientific  measurement 
and  are  the  same  for  all  men.  Compare  Plato's  reference  to  'counting 
and  weighing  and  measuring'  in  Republic,  6o2d.

dual  sense-organs  or  our  position  in  space ;  (3)  the  thing-in-itself, 
which  is  what  it  is  independently  of  the  human  mind,  but 
which,  for  reasons  to  be  considered  later,  cannot  be  known 
byus^ 

On  this  view  secondary  and  primary  qualities,  taken  together, 
are  opposed  to  things-in-themselves  as  appearance  to  reality. 
The  distinction  between  secondary  and  primary  qualities  is  a 
distinction  within  appearance,  not  a  distinction  between 
appearance  and  reality.  The  secondary  qualities  are  (relatively) 
private  and  subjective,  the  primary  qualities  are  common  and 
objective,  appearances ;  but  they  are  neither  of  them  realities 
independent  of  the  mind  which  knows  them.  Nevertheless  the 
primary  qualities  do  not,  like  the  secondary,  exist  merely 
when  they  are  perceived:  they  are  permanent  characteristics 
of  the  objects  of  experience.1 

§  2.  Relation  of  Appearances  to  Reality 

What  is  the  relation  between  things-in-themselves  and 
appearances?  Kant  never  questions  the  reality  of  things-in- 
themselves,  and  never  doubts  that  appearances  are  appearances 
of  things-in-themselves.2  The  appearance  is  the  thing  as  it 
appears  to  us,  or  as  it  is  in  relation  to  us,  though  it  is  not  the 
thing  as  it  is  in  itself.  That  is  to  say,  things  as  they  are  in 
themselves  are  the  very  same  things  that  appear  to  us,  although 
they  appear  to  us,  and  because  of  our  powers  of  knowing  must 
appear  to  us,  as  different  from  what  they  are  in  themselves. 
Strictly  speaking,  there  are  not  two  things,  but  only  one  thing 
considered  in  two  different  ways:  the  thing  as  it  is  in  itself 
and  as  it  appears  to  us.3 

1  The  whole  doctrine  of  substance  is  meaningless  unless  this  is 
true.  For  Kant  the  actual  or  existent  is  not  what  is  immediately 
present  to  sensation,  but  what  is  connected  with  sensation  in  accor- 
dance with  the  Analogies.  See  A  225-6  =  B  272-3  and  compare 
Chapter  XLIX  §  i. 

1  Compare  Pro/.  §  13  Anmerk.  Ill  (IV  293).  I  believe  with  Adickes 
that  the  section  on  Phenomena  and  Noumena  implies  no  qualification 
of  this  assertion,  though  it  has  often  been  supposed  to  do  so.  See 
Adickes,  Kant  und  das  Ding  an  sich,  pp.  95  ff.,  and  compare  Chap- 
ter LVI.  3  Compare  B  XVIII-XIX  n. ;  B  XXVI ;  and  B  XXVII. 


62  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §2 

This  view  seems  to  be  Kant's  primary  view,  but  he  also 
speaks,  less  happily,  of  appearances  as  being  due  to  the  'influ- 
ence' of  things  in  themselves;  and  he  speaks  of  things-in- 
themselves  as  'affecting  us'  or  'affecting  our  sensibility',  and 
so  producing  appearances  or  ideas.  This  usage  is  natural  and 
difficult  to  avoid,  but  it  may  be  misleading.  We  must  remember 
that  the  relation  of  an  appearance  to  the  reality  which  appears 
is  more  intimate  than  the  relation  of  effect  to  cause,  and  involves 
no  such  temporal  succession  as  is  involved  in  the  causal  relation. 
It  would  be  truer  to  say  that  the  thing-in-itself  is  the  condition, 
than  that  it  is  the  cause,  of  the  appearance.1 

It  is  not,  however,  the  only  condition.  The  other  condition 
which  determines  the  character  of  appearances  is  the  mind. 
The  appearance  is  indeed  given  to  us  in  sensation,  which  is 
passive,  but  this  does  not  mean  that  the  thing-in-itself,  or  some 
part  of  it,  migrates  unchanged  into  our  mind;2  it  does  not 
mean — if  we  prefer  to  avoid  metaphor — that  the  thing-in- 
itself,  or  some  part  of  it,  appears  to  us  just  as  it  is  in  itself.  Our 
sensibility  is  such  that  things  must  appear  to  us  as  spatial 
and  temporal,  whatever  be  the  character  which  they  possess 
in  themselves.  Space  and  time  are  due  to  our  human  sensibility, 
or  in  Kant's  language  are  forms  of  our  sensibility,  and  not 
characteristics  of  things-in-themselves.  Furthermore,  if  we  are 
to  be  aware  not  merely  of  a  succession  of  sensa,  but  of  a  physical 
world  of  substances  in  interaction,  the  mind  must  be  active 
in  thinking,  and  must  contribute  to  the  manifold  of  sense  the 
categories — such  as  substance,  or  cause  and  effect — which 
belong  to  mind  in  its  nature  as  understanding.  The  character 
of  the  human  mind  (with  its  human  sensibility  and  under- 
standing) determines  (along  with  things-in-themselves)  our 
common  objective  world.  It  determines  in  short  how  things-in- 
themselves  must  appear  to  us.  For  this  reason  the  world  we 
know  is  a  world  of  appearance,  a  world  of  things  as  they  appear, 

1  Even  this  is  not  so  true  as  to  say  that  the  thing-in-itself  is  the 
reality  which  appears,  and  that  this  reality  is  for  us  unknown  and 
unknowable. 

•  Pro/.  §  9  (IV  282). 


II  §  3]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  63 

and  must  appear,  to  human  minds,  but  not  a  world  of  these 
things  as  they  are  in  themselves. 

The  world  we  know  is,  however,  not  an  appearance  to 
momentary  sense,  but  an  appearance  to  sense  and  thought, 
or  to  sense  and  understanding.  Just  because  the  mind  is  not 
mere  sense,  but  is  active  in  thinking,  it  is  able  to  transcend 
the  momentary  sensation,  and  to  be  aware  of  a  world  of  per- 
manent substances  in  interaction.  But  the  world  of  which  it  is 
aware — even  in  scientific  knowledge — is  a  world  transformed 
by  the  necessary  conditions  and  limitations  of  finite  human 
experience. 

§3.  Mental  States 

Kant's  primary  concern  is  with  the  physical  world  studied 
by  natural  science,  but  he  extends  his  principles  also  to  the 
mental  world  which  is  studied  by  psychology.  He  supposes 
that  just  as  we  have  an  outer  sense  which  enables  us  to  know 
a  world  of  bodies  in  space,  so  we  have  an  inner  sense  which 
enables  us  to  know  the  world  of  our  own  mental  states.  But 
what  we  know  by  inner  sense,  and  study  in  psychology,  is  also 
phenomenal:  we  know  our  own  mind,  not  as  it  is  in  itself,  but 
only  as  it  appears  to  us  under  the  special  conditions  which 
determine  human  knowledge.  We  know  it,  for  example,  as 
a  succession  of  mental  states  in  time ;  but  this  is  due  to  the  fact 
that  time  is  the  form  of  our  inner  sense.  Human  sensibility 
is  such  that  it  imposes  temporal  relations  on  what  is  given  to 
inner  sense ;  and  apart  from  this  condition  of  human  sensibility, 
intuition  might  apprehend  my  inner  states  without  any  reference 
to  time  or  to  change.1 

The  complications  to  which  this  view  gives  rise  are  obviously 
great,  and  it  is  to  be  remembered — although  Kant  appears  to 
waver  on  this  point — that  our  mental  states  and  physical 
bodies  are  all  part  of  one  phenomenal  world,  and  are  all  alike 
subject  to  the  laws  of  cause  and  effect.  It  is  part  of  Kant's 

1  A  37  —  B  54.  Kant's  own  statement  is  not  confined  to  changes 
of  inner  states,  but  it  is  these  which  he  has  specially  in  view. 


64  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  4 

theory  that  within  this  phenomenal  world  the  impact  of  light 
upon  the  human  eye  can  be  the  cause  of  a  sensation  of  colour.1 
Yet  the  ray  of  light  and  the  human  eye  and  the  sensation  of 
colour  are  all  appearances  of  unknown  things-in-themselves ; 
and,  as  we  have  seen,  Kant's  language  in  many  places  suggests 
that  things-in-themselves  are  the  causes  of  these  appearances. 
This  looks  like  a  double  causality  similar  to  the  double  causality 
which  Kant  finds  in  human  action  (such  that  the  will  in  itself 
may  be  free,  although  the  visible  actions  which  constitute  its 
appearances  in  the  phenomenal  world  are  all  determined  by 
the  law  of  cause  and  effect).2  The  phenomenal  cause  of  sensa- 
tions is  to  be  sought  in  the  movements  of  physical  bodies 
which  are  themselves  phenomenal,  but  the  ultimate  cause  (or, 
better,  condition)  is  the  thing-in-itself . 

If  the  self  which  is  known  in  inner  sense  is  only  phenomenal, 
what  are  we  to  say  of  the  self  which  knows  ?  Is  the  knowing  self 
a  thing-in-itself,  although  the  known  self  is  only  an  appearance  ? 
To  this  question  Kant's  answer  is  obscure;  but  perhaps  we 
may  say,  in  the  light  of  his  moral  philosophy,  that  the  self  does 
belong  to  the  realm  of  things-in-themselves,  although  as  a 
thing-in-itself  it  can  never  be  known  by  us.3 

On  this  view  the  phenomenal  world  which  we  know  is  the 
joint  product  of  the  knowing  mind  and  things-in-them- 
selves. We  can  analyse  it  into  different  elements  which  have 
a  different  origin.  What  Kant  calls  the  manifold  of  sense  is 
contributed  by  things-in-themselves,  but  the  space  and  time 
in  which  the  manifold  is  arranged,  and  the  categories  under 
which  the  manifold  is  thought,  are  the  contribution  of  the 
human  mind. 

§  4.  Difficulties 

The  distinction  between  a  phenomenal  world  which  we  know 
and  a  world  of  things-in-themselves  which  we  do  not  know 
is  fundamental  to  Kant's  metaphysics.  It  enables  him  both 
to  explain  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  phenomenal  world, 

1  Compare  A  28  and  A  213  =  B  260. 

2  See  B  XXVII-XXVIII.  3  Compare  B  XXVIII. 


II  §  4]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  65 

and  also  to  justify  our  belief  in  God  and  in  human  freedom. 
Unless  we  adopt  this  distinction  as  a  provisional  hypothesis, 
we  cannot  hope  to  have  other  than  an  external  view  of  his 
philosophy.  The  understanding  of  Kant  has  been  hampered 
in  this  country  by  the  fact  that  when  he  began  to  be  studied 
here,  the  idealist  philosophy  of  Germany  had  discarded  the 
unknown  thing-in-itseif .  Hence  the  English  neo-Kantians  were 
apt  to  underestimate  or  ignore  this  side  of  his  philosophy,  and 
to  interpret  (or  misinterpret)  Kant  in  terms  of  Hegel. 

The  difficulties  of  the  Kantian  hypothesis  are  indeed  obvious. 
If  we  cannot  apply  our  human  categories  to  things-in-them- 
selves,  how  can  we  speak  of  things-in-themselves  in  the  plural? 
Is  not  number  for  Kant  bound  up  with  the  category  of  quantity, 
and  meaningless  apart  from  space  and  time  ?  How  can  we  say 
that  our  sensations  are  due  to  the  influence  of  things-in-them- 
selves ?  Is  not  'influence'  simply  a  word  for  a  special  case  of 
the  category  of  cause?  More  generally,  can  we  accept  an 
admittedly  unknown  reality  as  an  essential  part  of  any  intel- 
ligible explanation  of  the  world?  Above  all,  can  we  believe — if 
this  is  Kant's  doctrine — that  the  world  as  we  experience  it  is 
due  to  the  interplay  of  two  unknown  things-in-themselves,  one 
of  which  is  a  self,  while  the  other  is  perhaps  not  a  self  P1  It  is 
difficult  to  accept  one  wholly  unknown  factor.  It  is  almost 
impossible  to  accept  two.  If  they  are  wholly  unknown,  how 
can  they  be  distinguished  from  one  another  ?2 

Kant  holds  that  we  can  think  things-in-themselves,  although 
we  cannot  know  them,3  and  in  this  way  he  may  perhaps  hope 
to  avoid  some  of  these  difficulties.  But  such  a  view  introduces 
new  difficulties  of  its  own.  According  to  him  it  is  possible  for 
us  to  think,  that  is  to  entertain  a  concept,  without  being  able 
to  show  that  there  is,  or  even  can  be,  an  object  corresponding 
to  such  a  concept.  If  we  are  to  know  an  object,  and  not  merely 

1  Kant  is  willing  to  suppose  that  this  also  may  be  a  self,  or  at 
any  rate  a  monad ;  but  he  regards  such  a  supposition  as  mere  specu- 
lation. 

2  In  A  358  Kant  himself  suggests  the  possibility  that  there  may 
not  be  two  things,  but  only  one.

66  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  4 

to  think  it,  we  must  be  able  to  show  at  least  the  possibility 
of  an  object  corresponding  to  our  thought.  A  thought  or 
concept  is  possible,  that  is,  logically  possible,  if  it  is  not  self- 
contradictory.  It  does  not  follow  from  this  that  its  object  is 
possible.  The  real  possibility  of  the  object  must  be  shown  in 
other  ways.  We  may,  for  example,  be  able  to  think  or  conceive 
freedom  without  any  logical  contradiction,  and  yet  be  unable 
to  show  that  freedom  itself  is  really  possible.  In  such  a  case 
we  are  said  to  think  freedom,  but  not  to  know  it.1  We  can  also 
think  or  conceive  a  figure  bounded  by  two  straight  lines,  for 
this  involves  no  logical  contradiction.  But  we  cannot  know  such 
a  figure,  because  it  is  incompatible  with  the  nature  of  space, 
which  is  a  condition  of  our  experiencing  objects.2 

The  difficulties  of  such  a  distinction  do  not  concern  us  here, 
but  only  its  application  to  the  thing-in-itself .  Since  the  thing- 
in-itself  is  ex  hypothesi  real,  it  would  seem  to  be  ex  hypothesi 
possible ;  and  if  we  can  think  it,  and  think  it  truly,  how  is  such 
thought  to  be  distinguished  from  knowledge  ? 

Kant's  answer  is  that  such  thought  is  empty.  It  is  merely 
the  thought  of  an  unknown  something  which  is  neither  real 
nor  possible  in  the  same  sense  as  objects  of  experience  are  real 
or  possible.3  We  can  think  only  by  means  of  human  categories, 
but  these  categories  (including  the  category  of  actuality  or 
existence)  are  empty  apart  from  a  manifold  given  to  sense 
under  the  forms  of  space  and  time :  in  abstraction  from  sense 
they  cannot  give  us  knowledge. 

This  answer  gives  rise  to  fresh  difficulties.  The  categories 
on  this  view  cannot,  strictly  speaking,  apply  to  things-in-them- 
selves,4  even  although  we  are  unable  to  speak  or  think  of 

1  See  B  XXVIII. 

2  See  A  220-1  =  B  268.   Other  examples  will  be  found  on  the 
same  page  and  those  that  follow. 

3  For  this  sense,   see  the  Postulates  of  Empirical  Thought  and 
compare  Chapters  XLIX  and  L. 

4  Adickes  (Kant  und  das  Ding  an  sich,  p.  57)  maintains  that  Kant 
uses  the  word  'category*  in  two  senses,  (i)  as  synthetic  functions  of 
our  transcendental  unity  of  apperception,  and  (2)  as  the  most  uni- 
versal qualities,  connexions,  and  relations  of  things  which  are  created 
or  posited  by  these  functions;  and  that  categories  in  the  second 


II  §  s]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  67 

things-in-themselves  without  making  use  of  the  categories.  Such 
use  seems  to  be  mythological  and  devoid  of  intelligible  meaning. 
What  meaning  it  has  for  us  is  due  to  the  assumption  of  some 
sort  of  analogy1  between  things-in-themselves  and  objects  of 
experience;  and  this  assumption  is  illegitimate,  if  we  take  it 
as  a  basis  for  genuine  knowledge.2 

§  5.  Historical  Background 

Kant's  doctrine — like  any  doctrine  which  speaks  of  the 
unknown  and  unknowable — has  the  appearance  of  paradox, 
or  even  of  self-contradiction,  and  it  is  the  more  necessary  to 
understand  the  grounds  which  lead  men  to  hold  views  of 
this  type. 

The  doctrine  is  partly  due  to  the  history  of  philosophy 
during  the  eighteenth  century.  Of  the  two  schools  which  were 
active  at  that  period,  the  empirical  school  believed  that  the 
mind  was  a  tabula  ram,  which  received  passively  the  impres- 
sions of  sense;  and,  this  belief,  when  its  implications  are  thought 
out,  results  in  the  view  that  mind  can  never  penetrate  to  a  reality 
which  is  the  source  of  these  impressions.  This  consequence 
was  gradually  made  explicit  in  the  writings  of  Berkeley  and 
Hume.  The  rationalistic  school,  on  the  other  hand,  assumed 
that  pure  thinking  could  grasp  the  ultimate  realities;  for 
example,  that  it  could  demonstrate  the  existence  and  attributes 
of  God. -Kant  himself  had  been  brought  up  in  the  rationalistic 
view,  but  had  finally  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  pretensions 
of  pure  thought  to  know  such  ultimate  realities  are  unwarranted. 
He  continued  nevertheless  to  believe  in  these  realities,  and 

sense  can  be  applied  to  things-in-themselves.  This  seems  to  me 
mistaken,  but  he  is  right  in  saying  that  if  they  can  be  so  applied,  they 
must  be  unschematised  categories:  e.g.  causality  as  applied  to  things- 
in-themselves  involves  no  idea  of  temporal  succession. 

1  This  is  expressly  stated  by  Kant  in  A  696  =  B  724  and  A  698 
=  B  726. 

2  See  Chapter  LIV  for  Kant's  rejection  of  this  'transcendental 
use*  of  categories.  For  a  defence  of  'cognition  by  analogy* — as  opposed 
to    'theoretical    cognition' — see    Fortschritte    der   Metaphysik    (Phil. 
Bib.  46c,  p.  107),  and  compare  Kritik  der  Urteilskraft  §  59  (V  352). 


68  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  6 

therefore,  when  he  gave  up  rationalism,  he  was  forced  to  the 
view  that  things-in-themselves  are  unknowable. 

§  6.  Idealism  and  Science 

The  reasons  for  Kant's  view  are,  however,  deeper  than  this. 
In  his  thought  idealistic  and  realistic  tendencies  are  at  work, 
and  it  is  the  combination  of  the  two  which  produces  the  doctrine 
of  the  thing-in-itself . 

Idealism,  whatever  be  its  ultimate  value,  is  more  than  a  mere 
confusion  of  thought  or  a  temporary  aberration  of  the  modern 
mind.  It  is  partly  a  reaction  against  science,  an  attempt  to 
preserve  the  reality  of  human  values  in  a  mechanical  world; 
but  it  is  also  related  to  the  development  of  modern  science 
(especially  physics)  in  a  more  positive  and  intimate  way. 

The  natural  tendency  of  the  human  mind  is  realistic,  and  to 
common  sense  our  ordinary  world  of  tables  and  chairs  and 
houses  and  trees  is  the  real  world.  The  world  of  tables  and 
chairs  is,  however,  very  different  from  the  world  as  known 
to  physics.  The  development  of  physics  forces  on  our  minds 
the  contrast  between  appearance  and  reality,  between  the  world 
as  it  seems  to  common  sense  and  the  world  as  it  is  to  the 
scientific  observer.  This  in  turn  gives  rise  to  further  reflexions. 
If  what  is  obviously  real  to  common  sense  becomes  mere 
appearance  to  the  deeper  insight  of  the  scientist,  may  there 
not  be  a  still  deeper  insight  to  which  the  real  as  known  by  the 
scientist  is  merely  the  appearance  of  a  reality  beyond  ? 

The  view  that  the  scientist  deals  only  with  appearance  is  the 
view  which  Kant  holds;  and  it  rests,  not  on  a  mere  sceptical 
fancy  or  plausible  analogy,  but  on  a  criticism  of  science 
itself. 

Such  criticism  is  forced  upon  us  in  the  present  century,  even 
more  than  in  the  time  of  Kant.  Knowledge  is  developing  so 
rapidly  that  the  physical  world  as  it  appeared  to  science  the 
day  before  yesterday  is  very  different  from  the  physical  world 
as  it  appears  to  science  to-day.  Who  knows  how  it  will  appear 
to-morrow?  There  are  few  thinkers  who  would  claim  that 
modern  science  gives  us  adequate  knowledge  of  the  world 


II  §  6]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  69 

as  it  really  is ;  and  even  the  fundamental  concepts  of  physics 
are  being  subjected  to  criticism  and  revision.  The  scientists 
themselves  are  finding  paradoxes  and  inconsistencies  thrust 
upon  them — as  in  the  case  of  the  Quantum  Theory  and  the 
Theory  of  Relativity.  It  is  even  asserted  that  time  is  merely 
a  human  way  of  looking  at  things,  and  is  not  to  be  found  in  the 
physical  world ;  and  that  we  are  aware  only  of  our  own  measure- 
ments, but  have  no  idea  of  what  it  is  that  we  are  measuring. 
Such  assertions,  made  quite  independently  of  Kant's  influence, 
look  very  like  a  revival  of  the  Kantian  doctrine,  and  give  an 
added  interest  to  the  argument  of  the  Krtitk. 

No  doubt  it  may  be  said  with  justice  that  all  such  distinctions 
between  appearance  and  reality  are  made  on  the  basis  of 
knowledge  (or  presumed  knowledge)  of  reality,  and  therefore 
they  cannot  justify  a  distinction  in  which  reality  becomes  the 
unknown  and  appearance  the  known.  The  knowledge  of  reality 
required  for  the  distinction  may,  however,  be  of  the  most 
general  character,  such  as  the  knowledge  that  reality  must  be 
consistent  with  itself.  If  our  theories  of  reality  contradict  one 
another,  we  know  that  what  is  asserted  in  them  is  at  least 
partly  appearance  and  not  reality;  but  we  may  not  be  in  a 
position  to  construct  the  true  theory  which  would  describe 
reality  as  it  is.  The  knowledge  that  reality  is  self-consistent 
is  a  very  empty  kind  of  knowledge,  and  even  Kant  would 
perhaps-  admit  we  had  that  kind  of  knowledge  of  things-in- 
themselves.1  He  would,  however,  maintain  that  so  empty  a 
principle  does  not  enable  us  to  make  any  further  advance  in 
knowledge,  unless  things-in-themselves  are  given  to  us  in 
experience,  as  he  believes  they  cannot  be. 

At  any  rate  Kant's  doctrine  is  this,  that  scientific  thought 
can  penetrate  beyond  our  passing  sensations  to  a  common  and 
objective  world  of  substances  in  interaction,  but  that  this 
world  is  a  world  of  things  as  they  appear  to  human  minds,  and 
not  a  world  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.' It  would  be 
unreasonable  without  examining  his  arguments  to  dismiss  this 
theory  on  the  ground  that  it  is  a  contradiction  in  terms. 
1  This  seems  to  be  implied  in  the  Antinomies. 


70  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  7 

That  the  world,  even  as  it  is  known  to  science,  is  essentially 
an  appearance  to  human  minds  is  an  idealist  doctrine  (not  of 
course  the  only  idealist  doctrine).  It  is  because  Kant  is  in  a 
sense  a  realist  that  he  holds  this  world  not  to  be  a  creation  of 
human  minds,  but  to  involve  the  reality  of  things-in-themselves. 

§  7.  Kant's  Realistic  Tendencies 

Kant  is  trying  to  do  justice  to  different  sides  of  our  experi- 
ence. He  recognises  that  the  world  is  given  to  us,  and  is  not  the 
product  of  thinking  or  of  fancy.  There  is  a  kind  of  compulsion 
in  our  experience  which  is  different  from  the  intelligible 
necessity  by  which  the  conclusion  follows  from  the  pre- 
mises of  an  argument.  We  can  see  the  sky  only  as  blue,  and 
no  amount  of  thinking  will  alter  its  colour.  Kant  never  ceases 
to  believe  that  there  is  a  passive  element  in  our  experience, 
and  that  something  given  without  any  effort  on  our  part  is 
necessary  for  human  knowledge. 

It  does  not,  however,  appear  that  he  argued  from  the  exis- 
tence of  the  given  to  the  reality  of  things-in-themselves  as  its 
necessary  cause.  Such  an  argument  is  unconvincing  in  itself, 
and  doubly  unconvincing  for  a  philosophy  which  confines  the 
category  of  cause  to  the  world  of  appearances.1  Rather  he  would 
seem  to  regard  the  thing-in-itself  as  immediately  present  to  us 
in  all  appearances,  although  its  real  (as  opposed  to  its  apparent) 
character  is  to  us  unknown.2 

The  reality  of  things-in-themselves  is  not  considered  by 
Kant  to  be  in  need  of  proof.  It  would,  he  says,  be  ludicrous 
that  there  should  be  an  appearance  without  something  which 
appears.3  This  is  the  presupposition  both  of  common  sense 
and  of  realism,  and  it  is  neither  questioned  nor  doubted  by 

1  Compare  A  609  =B  637. 

2  Adickes  has  argued  this  view  with  great  force  in  Kant  und  das 
Ding  an  sick.  Compare  Vaihinger,  Commentary  ii,  pp.  no— ir. 

8  B  XXVII;  A  25 1-2.  Taken  as  an  argument,  such  a  statement  is 
unconvincing,  for  it  depends  on  the  term  *  appearance',  which  may 
be  inappropriate.  Nevertheless  it  expresses  one  of  the  fundamental, 
if  unreflective,  convictions  of  the  human  mind,  and  this  conviction 
is  shared  by  Kant. 


II  §  8]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  71 

Kant.  The  only  question  with  which  he  is  concerned  is  whether 
the  thing-in-itself  can,  or  can  not,  be  known. 

For  naive  realism  things  are  in  themselves  just  what  they 
appear  to  be.  The  philosophy  of  scientific  materialism  strips 
off  the  secondary  qualities  as  mere  appearances,  and  regards 
the  physical  body  as  the  thing-in-itself.  Kant  goes  a  stage 
further  and  strips  off  the  primary  qualities  also  as  appearances 
(although  appearances  of  a  different  kind).  He  is  then  left  with 
a  thing-in-itself  which  has  no  knowable  characteristics  other 
than  that  of  being  the  thing,  not  as  it  appears  to  us,  but  as 
it  is  in  itself. 

Kant  holds  that  the  retention  of  the  thing-in-itself  dis- 
tinguishes his  philosophy  from  idealism  as  previously 
understood,  and  especially  from  such  a  philosophy  as  that 
of  Bishop  Berkeley.1 

Although  Kant  nowhere  expressly  says  so,  it  seems  reason- 
able to  suppose  that  he  believed  the  reality  of  things-in-them- 
selves  to  be  necessary,  if  there  is  to  be  a  common  objective 
world  known  to  different  individuals.  Such  a  common  objective 
world  he  everywhere  assumes,  and  he  assumes  further  that 
it  is  the  object  of  scientific  knowledge.  Science  in  his  view  seeks 
to  get  beyond  the  merely  individual  point  of  view,  to  ignore 
what  is  due  to  the  individual's  sense-organs  and  position  in 
space,  and  to  discover  the  world  which  is  common  to  all  men 
who  take  the  necessary  trouble  and  perform  the  necessary 
measurements. 

The  existence  of  different  individual  knowing  minds  is  also 
assumed  by  Kant.  He  does  not  attempt  to  prove  it,  or  even  to 
discuss  our  reasons  for  believing  it. 

§  8.  Kant's  Arguments 

If  we  are  to  follow  Kant,  we  must  start  from  the  common- 
sense  assumption  that  there  are  real  things,  and  that  these  real 

1  See  ProL  §  13  Anmerk.  Ill  (IV  293).  It  must,  however,  be 
remembered  that  Kant's  belief  in  the  permanent  existence  (or  pheno- 
menal reality)  of  physical  substances  is  at  least  as  important  a  ground 
for  distinguishing  his  view  from  that  of  Berkeley.  See  the  Refutation 
of  Idealism. 


72  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  8 

things  appear  to  us.  The  hypothesis1  which  Kant  puts  forward, 
and  hopes  to  demonstrate  in  the  Kritik,  is  that  real  things 
never  appear  to  us  as  they  are  in  themselves ;  that  we  can  never 
know  things  as  they  are  in  themselves,  but  only  their  appear- 
ances, whose  character  is  affected  throughout  by  the  nature 
of  the  knowing  mind. 

I  have  expressed  this  in  a  negative  way,  and  the  negative 
side  of  Kant's  doctrine  is  of  importance.  Kant  hopes  to  prove 
the  uselessness  of  speculation  about  ultimate  reality,  and  also 
to  defend  religion  and  morality  against  attacks  by  showing  the 
incompetence  of  theoretical  reason  in  such  matters.2  The 
positive  side  of  his  argument  is,  however,  of  equal,  or  even 
greater,  importance.  If  metaphysics  will  only  cease  from  the 
pursuit  of  an  ultimate  and  unknowable  reality  and  will  concern 
itself  with  the  world  of  appearances,  then  it  will  be  able  to 
enter  on  the  sure  path  of  an  exact  science.3  We  must  give  up 
the  speculative  metaphysics  of  the  past  and  substitute  for  it 
a  metaphysic  of  experience.4  If  we  do  so,  we  shall  be  able  to 
acquire  with  little  difficulty  a  limited,  but  complete,  system 
of  infallible  knowledge.  The  Kritik  does  not  profess  to  offer 
us  such  a  system,  but  it  offers  us  the  complete  plan  of  such 
a  system,  and  there  remains  only  the  comparatively  easy  task 
of  filling  in  minor  details.5 

The  central  principle  of  Kant's  argument  is  the  revolutionary 
and  paradoxical  view  that  we  can  have  a  priori  knowledge  of 
things  only  in  so  far  as  what  we  know  of  them  is  imposed 
by  the  nature  of  our  own  minds.6  Kant  hopes  to  show  (i)  that 
we  do  possess  a  priori  (that  is,  universal  and  necessary)  know- 
ledge, and  (2)  that  there  is  no  explanation  of  such  knowledge 
unless  the  character  of  the  objects  as  known  is  determined 

1  Compare  B  XXII  n.  2  See  B  XXXI.          3  B  XVIII-XIX. 

4  So  we  may  suitably  describe  what  Kant  calls  (in  B  XVIII)  *meta- 
physics  in  its  first  part*.  This  is  dealt  with  in  the  Aesthetic  and 
Analytic.

put  into  them.'  The  roots  of  this  view  are  to  be  found  in  Leibniz, 
but  he  failed  to  draw  the  obvious  conclusions. 


II  §  8]  APPEARANCE  AND  REALITY  73 

by  the  nature  of  our  powers  of  knowing.  If  the  second  conten- 
tion is  true,  it  follows  that  our  a  priori  knowledge  is  knowledge, 
not  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves,  but  of  things  as  they 
must  appear  to  us.  We  must  give  up  hopes  of  attaining  a  priori 
knowledge  in  regard  to  ultimate  reality,  but  we  can  determine 
with  complete  accuracy  and  precision  our  a  priori  knowledge 
of  the  phenomenal  world.  It  is  not  the  least  of  Kant's  claims 
that  his  philosophy,  and  his  alone,  can  offer  a  justification 
of  our  a  priori  knowledge  in  mathematics,  and  can  determine 
the  a  priori  principles  presupposed  in  experimental  physics. 

Kant's  central  argument  may  be  said  to  differentiate  itself 
into  three  main  arguments.  These  are  concerned  with  intuition, 
understanding,  and  reason.  Intuition  involves  an  immediate 
relation  to  a  given  individual  object,  and  in  human  beings 
intuition  is  always  sensuous  and  not  intellectual,  which  means 
that  it  is  passive  and  not  active.1  Understanding  is  a  power 
of  thinking,  by  means  of  concepts,  the  objects  given  in  intuition. 
Reason  is  a  power  of  thinking  objects  which  can  never  be 
given  in  sensuous  intuition. 

In  the  Aesthetic  Kant  maintains  that  our  intuitions  of  space 
and  time  are  a  priori  intuitions,  and  are  therefore  due  to  the 
nature  of  our  sensibility.  Hence  our  a  priori  intuitions  of  space 
and  time  (the  only  a  priori  intuitions  we  possess)  cannot  give 
us  knowledge  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.  They  can, 
however,  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of  things  as  they  must 
appear  to  human  minds;  for  things  can  appear  to  human 
minds  only  if  they  are  given  to  a  sensibility  which  imposes 
spatial  and  temporal  form  on  all  the  empirical  intuitions 
it  receives. 

In  the  Analytic  he  argues  that  the  categories  of  the  under- 
standing (such  as  cause  and  effect)  are  a  priori  concepts,  and 
depend  therefore  on  the  nature  of  thought,  not  of  things ;  they 
are  meaningless  and  empty,  except  as  applied  to  temporal  and 
spatial  things,  that  is,  to  appearances  given  in  human  intuition. 
Hence  understanding  cannot  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of 
things-in-themselves,  but  only  of  appearances.

74  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [II  §  8 

In  the  Dialectic  (especially  in  the  Antinomies)  he  argues 
that  although  reason  must,  by  its  very  nature,  seek  to  go 
beyond  what  is  given  to  sense,  and  must  strive  to  pass  from 
the  conditioned  to  the  unconditioned,  nevertheless  it  falls  into 
hopeless  contradictions  when  it  supposes  that  our  human 
categories  apply  to  things-in-themselves.  These  contradictions 
are  solved,  if  we  distinguish  the  unknown  thing-in-itself  from 
its  appearances,  and  if  we  recognise  that  our  categories  apply 
to  appearances  alone. 

Therefore  neither  by  intuition,  nor  by  understanding,  nor 
by  reason,  nor  by  any  combination  of  these,  can  we  have 
a  priori  knowledge  of  things-in-themselves,  although  we  can 
have  such  knowledge  of  the  phenomenal  world. 

These  proofs  may  be  said  to  be  confirmed  by  the  fact  that 
when  we  accept  their  conclusions  on  purely  intellectual  grounds, 
we  are  able  to  justify  our  moral  and  religious  beliefs.  These 
are  unjustifiable  if  we  suppose  that  our  categories  apply  to 
ultimate  reality.  If,  for  example,  the  category  of  cause  and 
effect  applies  to  things-in-themselves,  freedom,  which  is 
necessary  to  morality,  becomes  a  manifest  impossibility.1 

The  value  of  each  of  these  arguments  has  to  be  considered 
on  its  own  merits.  In  the  present  book  I  am  concerned  only 
with  the  first  two  arguments,  but  it  must  be  remembered  that 
the  argument  of  the  Dialectic  is  of  equal  importance.  It  must 
also  be  remembered  that  although  we  know  nothing  of  things  as 
they  are  in  themselves,  we  do  know  how  they  appear,  and  must 
appear,  to  human  minds;  and  further  that  the  limitations  of 
our  theoretical  knowledge  are  to  a  certain  extent  overcome, 
according  to  Kant,  by  a  reasonable  faith  founded  on  our 
moral  experience.

CHAPTER     III 
SYNTHETIC   A   PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS 

§  i.  The  Copernican  Revolution 

Kant  is  attempting  to  make  a  revolution  in  philosophy. 
He  believes  that  there  comes,  in  the  sciences,  a  point  where 
some  one  introduces  a  complete  change  of  method,  and  by  this 
change  the  science  becomes  really  a  science :  it  ceases  to  be  a 
mere  'groping  about',  and  enters  upon  the  sure  path  of  steady 
progress.  Such  a  change  occurred  in  mathematics  when  demon- 
stration by  means  of  construction  was  introduced.  It  occurred 
in  physics  when  Galileo  and  Torricelli  developed  the  experi- 
mental method.  It  occurred  in  astronomy  when  the  Copernican 
hypothesis  was  first  propounded.  Kant  compares  his  own 
philosophical  revolution  with  that  initiated  by  Copernicus. 

At  first  sight  no  comparison  could  seem  more  inappropriate. 
Copernicus  substituted  a  heliocentric  explanation  in  astronomy 
for  the  existing  geocentric  explanation.  Kant  seems,  in  the 
sphere  of  metaphysics,  to  be  doing  almost  the  precise  opposite 
-—making  the  human  mind  the  centre  of  the  phenomenal 
universe,  so  that  things  must  conform  to  our  mind,  rather  than 
our  mind  to  things. 

Kant. himself,  however,  states  quite  clearly  the  precise  point 
of  the  analogy.1  Copernicus  explained  the  apparent  motions 
of  the  heavenly  bodies  as  due  to  the  motion  of  the  observer 
on  the  earth.2  Kant  similarly  .explains  the  apparent  character- 
istics of  reality  as  due  to  the  mind  of  the  knower.3  The  analogy 

1  B  XVI ;  B  XXII  n.  The  critics  who  condemn  him  on  this  point 
have  simply  failed  to  understand  what  he  says. 

2  We  shall  see  Kant's  comparison  most  easily  if  we  think  of  the 
fixed  stars  as  having  themselves  no  motion;  for  then  their  apparent 
motion  is  entirely  due  to  the  observer.  Similarly  we  must  regard 
things-in-themselves  as  neither  spatial  nor  temporal;  the  fact  that 
they  appear  to  be  so  is  entirely  due  to  the  nature  of  the  human  mind. 

8  Kemp  Smith  (Commentary,  p,  24)  supports  this  interpretation 
by  quotations  from  Copernicus,  De  Revolutionibus. 


76  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §2 

is  not  loose,  and  still  less  is  it  inappropriate:  it  is  absolutely 
precise. 

Kant  believes  that  the  task  of  knowing  the  mind  in  its 
cognitive  powers  is  comparatively  easy,  and  has  indeed  been 
largely  performed  by  the  existing  logic.1  If  the  fundamental 
characteristics  of  reality  as  it  appears  are  due  to  the  nature 
of  the  knowing  mind,  it  should  not  be  difficult  to  give  an 
exhaustive  account  of  them.2 

This  will  be  the  task  of  'the  first  part  of  metaphysics',  that 
is,  of  Kant's  own  positive  metaphysics,  which  is  concerned 
with  the  world  of  experience. 

§  2.  A  priori  Knowledge 

Kant's  main  ground  for  attempting  a  revolution  in  philo- 
sophy is  the  fact  that  we  possess  a  priori  knowledge.3  Either 
our  ideas  must  conform  to  things,  or  things  (as  known)  must 
conform  to  our  ideas.4  If  the  former  hypothesis  be  adopted, 
a  priori  knowledge  is  impossible.  Only  on  the  latter  hypothesis 
can  the  possibility  of  such  knowledge  be  understood.  This 
is  the  central  and  revolutionary  doctrine  of  the  Kritik. 

What  then  is  a  priori  knowledge?  It  is  knowledge  which 
is  independent  of  experience  and  of  all  sense-impressions.5 
Knowledge  which  is  derived  from  experience  or  sense-impres- 
sions6 is  empirical  or  a  posteriori. 

Kant  distinguishes  pure  a  priori  knowledge  from  knowledge 
which,  although  a  priori,  is  not  free  from  empirical  elements.7 

1  A  XIV.  2  A  XX;  B  XXXVI. 

8  Compare  Chapter  II  §  7.  Kant  is  really  thinking  only  of  synthetic 
a  priori  knowledge,  as  is  explained  in  §  4  below. 

*  BXVI-XVII;  A  92  =  B  124;  A  114;  A  128-9;  B  166. 

5  B  2.  Nevertheless  such  knowledge  begins  only  with  experience, 
and  indeed  can  be  separated  from  the  matter  of  sense-impressions 
only  by  a  skill  which  requires  long  practice;  see  B  1-2. 

6  B  3.    For  Kant  intuition,  and  therefore  sense-impressions,  are 
essential  to  human  experience. 

7  It  may  seem  at  first  sight  surprising  that  the  example  given  of 
a  priori  knowledge  which  is  not  pure  is  the  proposition  *  Every 
event  has  its  cause*.  This  is  explained  in  A  160  =  B  199-200.  Com- 
pare A  171  =  B  212-13  and  also  Chapter  XXXVI  §  3. 


Ill  §  3]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  77 

To  this  distinction  he  does  not  consistently  adhere,  and  'pure' 
is  commonly  used  as  synonymous  with  'a  priori9.1 

The  definition  of  a  priori  knowledge  is  negative,  but  this 
negative  definition  is  supplemented  by  a  positive  criterion. 
Necessity  and  universality2  are  the  criteria  or  marks  by  which 
we  distinguish  the  a  priori  from  the  empirical.  Experience  can 
give  us  only  generalisations  from  fact.  We  can  say  by  experience 
that  all  swans,  so  far  as  we  have  observed  them,  are  white; 
but  we  cannot  say  that  they  must  be  white,  or  that  there  can 
be  no  exception  to  the  general  rule.  When  we  say  that  all 
triangles  have  the  interior  angles  equal  to  two  right  angles, 
we  are  stating  what  is  necessary  and  universal.  The  merely 
'general'  admits  of  exceptions,  but  the  'universal'  does  not.3 

Kant  holds  that  if  we  possess  a  priori  knowledge,  we  must 
have  a  power  or  faculty  of  a  priori  knowledge.4  This  doctrine 
is  common  to  him  and  his  rationalistic  predecessors.  They 
believed,  however,  as  Kant  himself  did  for  long,  that  this 
power  of  a  priori  knowledge  (which  for  them  was  reason)  gave 
us  knowledge  of  things-in-themselves,  Kant  argues  that  if  we 
think  out  what  is  involved  in  the  possession  of  a  priori  know- 
ledge, we  shall  see  that  it  must  be  derived  from  the  nature 
of  mind,  and  not  from  the  nature  of  things.  This  doctrine 
must  be  distinguished  from  the  mere  assumption  that  we  have 
a  power  of  a  priori  knowledge. 

§  3.  Temporal  priority 

The  a  priori  does  not  involve  temporal  priority.  All  our 
knowledge  begins  with  experience,  and  there  is  no  knowledge 
which  precedes  experience  in  time.5  Yet  although  all  know- 
ledge begins  with  experience,  it  is  possible  that  some  knowledge 
is  not  derived  from  experience,  and  is  not  dependent  on 

1  Compare  B  i  (the  title  of  the  section). 

2  Prichard  suggests  that  these    are  ultimately  identical  (Kant's 
Theory  of  Knowledge,  p.  4  n.  3). 

3  In  B  3-4  Kant  distinguishes  comparative  or  empirical  univer- 
sality from  strict  (or  rational)  universality.  For  the  difference  between 
'general*  and  'universal',  see  Log.  §  84  Anmerk.  2  and  §21  Anmerk.  2

78  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §  3 

experience.  Experience  may  be  something  composite  ;  and  it 
may  be  that  sense  impressions  give  us  the  matter,  while  our 
powers  of  knowledge  give  us  the  form,  of  experience. 

This  doctrine  is  stated  emphatically  at  the  beginning  of  the 
Introduction  in  both  editions,  and  it  is  repeated  again  and 
again  in  the  Kritik  and  in  Kant's  other  writings. 

A  few  examples  will  make  this  point  clear.  Pure  concepts  are 
said  to  lie  already  prepared  in  the  human  understanding,  but 
they  are  developed  on  the  occasion  of  experience.1  We  can 
discover  in  experience  the  occasioning  causes  of  their  produc- 
tion.2 The  impressions  of  the  senses  supply  the  first  stimulus 
to  bring  experience  into  existence,  an  experience  whose  matter 
comes  from  sense,  and  whose  form  comes  from  pure  intuition 
and  thought.3  Without  data  even  the  elements  of  a  priori 
cognitions  would  not  be  able  to  arise  in  thought.4 

From  these  and  many  other  passages5  we  can  say  that  on 
Kant's  view  the  a  priori  is  at  work  in  experience  from  the 
start  —  there  is  no  experience  without  a  form  —  and  it  is  gradu- 
ally made  clear  to  consciousness  by  reflexion.  In  that  sense 
a  priori  knowledge  is  acquired  and  not  innate.  Kant  is  not 
concerned  with  the  question  of  how  experience  develops  —  that 
is  a  matter  for  psychology  —  but  with  what  is  contained  in 
experience,6  or  with  the  presuppositions  and  conditions  of 
experience.  He  does  not  suggest  that  in  infancy  we  begin 
by  knowing  space  and  time  and  the  categories,  and  then 
proceed  to  construct  a  world  of  colours  and  sounds. 

All  this  is  perfectly  familiar  to  Leibniz  and  his  school. 
Indeed  it  may  be  doubted  whether  the  crude  doctrine  that  the 
a  priori  is  also  temporally  prior  has  been  held  by  serious 
philosophers.  It  seems  to  be  attributed  to  rationalists  only 
through  the  misunderstandings  of  their  opponents. 

Nevertheless  Kant  habitually  uses  words  like  'before'  and 
precedes'  in  connexion  with  our  a  priori  knowledge,  where

Ill  §  3]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  79 

it  is  easy  to  suppose  that  he  is  speaking  of  temporal  priority. 
There  is,  however,  no  consistency  in  such  usage,  if  taken 
in  a  temporal  sense,  and  it  is  frequently  applied  to  the  empirical. 
Intuition  is  said  to  precede  thought.1  Knowledge  is  said  to 
start  with  the  senses,  to  proceed  thence  to  understanding,  and 
to  end  with  reason.2  On  the  other  hand  transcendental  truth 
is  said  to  precede  empirical  and  to  make  it  possible,3  and 
original  apperception  is  said  to  precede  all  particular  experi- 
ence.4 Where  two  things  reciprocally  condition  one  another, 
or  form  necessary  parts  of  a  wider  whole,  Kant  seems  to  use 
these  temporal  expressions  of  either  in  relation  to  the  other. 

In  certain  cases  the  a  priori  does  involve  temporal  priority. 
Thus  of  any  individual  circle  we  can  say,  before  we  have  ex- 
perienced it,  that  all  the  angles  subtended  by  any  arc  of  it  will 
be  equal.  We  might  even  make  discoveries  about  a  particular 
kind  of  geometrical  figure,  before  we  had  found  any  example 
of  that  figure  in  the  physical  world.  Furthermore,  if  space 
as  known  a  priori  is  due  to  the  nature  of  our  mind,  we  can  say 
that  our  mind  has  the  form  of  space  in  it  as  a  potentiality 
before  experience  begins.  Such  statements  Kant  certainly  makes, 
and  they  are  legitimate  statements.  Where  his  expressions 
can  be  interpreted  in  this  way,  it  seems  only  fair  so  to  interpret 
them.5 

It  is  possible  that  he  was  at  times  misled  by  these  legitimate 
statements  into  confusing  logical  and  temporal  priority,  though 
I  think  it  rash  to  affirm  that  he  was.  What  seems  to  me  certain 
is  that  such  confusion  is  no  part  of  his  essential  doctrine,  and 
would  have  been  indignantly  denied  by  him  if  the  question 
had  been  put  to  him  explicitly. 

Many  commentators  nevertheless  have,  to  a  greater  or  less 
degree,  put  a  temporal  interpretation  on  his  words,  and  have 
supposed  him  to  be  giving  an  account  of  psychological  develop- 
ment. To  adopt  this  view,  whether  in  a  crude  or  in  a  subtle

form,  is  to  reduce  Kant's  theory  to  absurdity.  An  interpretation 
which  has  this  result  is  prima  facie  an  unsatisfactory  interpreta- 
tion. It  seems  only  fair  to  Kant  to  see  whether  his  doctrines 
do  not  appear  more  convincing,  or  at  any  rate  more  plausible, 
when  interpreted  in  accordance  with  his  own  emphatic  state- 
ment, and  in  accordance  with  what  must  obviously  be  the 
truth,  if  the  existence  of  a  priori  knowledge  is  to  be  admitted 
at  all.1 

For  myself,  the  more  I  read  Kant,  the  more  I  am  convinced 
that  for  him  the  a  priori  is  the  logically,  or  as  he  calls  it  the 
objectively,  prior;  and  I  would  call  especial  attention  to  one 
passage  which  is  far  too  much  neglected,  a  passage  concerned 
with  time,  but  applying  also  to  all  other  a  priori  ideas.  Time, 
he  says,  is  objectively  prior  to  all  changes,  as  the  formal  condition 
of  their  possibility.  Subjectively,  that  is,  in  actual  consciousness, 
the  idea  of  time  is,  like  every  other,  given  only  through  the 
stimulus  (Veranlassung)  of  sense-perceptions.2  I  can  conceive 
no  clearer  statement  of  Kant's  fundamental  position. 

§  4.  Types  of  a  priori  Knowledge 

Do  we  actually  possess  a  priori  knowledge?  Kant  gives 
examples  to  show  that  we  do.3 

Ideas  of  space  and  substance  are  a  priori  ideas.  The  judge- 
ments of  mathematics  are  a  priori  judgements.  A  priori,  judge- 
ments are  to  be  found  even  in  common  sense,  as  for  example 
the  judgement  that  every  event  must  have  a  cause.  Unless  such 
judgements  are  true,  there  can  be  no  certainty  in  experience, 
and  no  basis  for  physical  science. 

Moreover  there  is  a  claim  made  by  metaphysics  to  possess 
a  priori  knowledge  going  beyond  experience,4  as  in  the  judge- 
ment that  the  world  has  no  beginning  in  time.  Such  a  claim 
demands  criticism,  but  the  necessity  for  criticism  is  overlooked 

1  On  this  point  of  interpretation  I  find  myself  consistently  at 
variance  with  Professor  Prichard,  though  I  believe  that  if  his  inter- 
pretation is  correct,  his  criticisms  are  unanswerable.

Ill  §4]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  81 

for  three  reasons.1  The  first  is  that  the  success  of  mathematics 
produces  an  expectation  of  equal  success  for  metaphysics. 
This  expectation  is  unfounded,  because  the  success  of  mathe- 
matics depends  upon  intuition,  and  there  can  be  no  intuition 
in  metaphysics — we  cannot  intuit  the  beginning  (or  absence 
of  beginning)  of  the  world.  The  second  is  that  in  metaphysical 
thinking  we  are  never  in  danger  of  being  contradicted  by 
experience.  And  the  third  is  that  a  great  deal  of  the  a  priori 
work  of  reason  consists  in  mere  analysis  of  our  concepts  of 
objects.  This  is  a  useful  task,  necessary  to  make  our  concepts 
distinct.2 .It  does  not  itself  extend  our  knowledge,  but  its  success 
encourages  us  to  imagine  that  by  the  activity  of  pure  reason  we 
can  extend  our  knowledge  without  any  help  from  experience. 

This  raises  the  question  of  the  distinction  between  analysis 
and  synthesis,  or  between  analytic  and  synthetic  judgements.3 

All  analytic  judgements  are  a  priori:  they  involve  no  appeal 
to  experience.  This  is  true  even  when  they  depend  upon 
analysis  of  empirical  concepts.  With  analytic  judgements  we 
have  no  concern  in  the  Kritik.  They  articulate  our  knowledge, 
but  do  not  add  to  it.  We  are  concerned  only  with  a  priori 
judgements  which  extend  our  knowledge,  and  these  are 
necessarily  synthetic. 

How  then  are  synthetic  a  priori  judgements  possible  ?  This  is 
the  central  question  of  the  Kritik. 

Synthetic  a  priori  judgements  are  to  be  found  in  mathe- 
matics, in  physics,  and  in  metaphysics.4  These  sciences  do  not 
advance  by  the  mere  analysis  of  concepts.  Hence  we  have  to 
consider  the  synthetic  a  priori  judgements  of  each  of  these 
sciences  in  turn,  and  to  ask  how  they  can  be  justified.  We  have 
no  right  to  assume  that  they  can  all  be  justified  in  the  same  way. 

This  gives  us  three  questions  to  answer.  Firstly,  how  is  pure 
mathematics  possible  ?  Secondly,  how  is  pure  physics  (or  the  pure 

1  A  4-6  =  B  8-10.  2  Compare  A  65  =  B  90. 

8  There  are  other  kinds  of  analysis  than  that  found  in  analytic 
judgements,  for  example,  analysis  of  intuitions.  The  analysis  of  which 
Kant  is  speaking  here  is  analysis  of  concepts  which  we  already  have 
of  objects — see  A  5  =  B  9.  In  so  far  as  we  judge  the  objects  on  the 
basis  of  such  analysis,  we  have  analytic  judgements.  4  B  14  ff.

part  of  physics)  possible  ?  And  thirdly,  how  is  pure  metaphysics 
possible  ? 

The  success  of  mathematics  and  physics  proves  that  they  are 
possible,  and  our  only  question  is  how  they  are  possible.  It  is 
otherwise  with  metaphysics,  which  has  behind  it  a  consistent 
record  of  contradiction  and  failure.  In  the  case  of  metaphysics 
we  have  to  ask  whether  it  is  possible,  and  only  if  we  get  an 
affirmative  answer,  need  we  ask  how  it  is  possible. 

In  regard  to  metaphysics  Kant  substitutes  two  other  ques- 
tions. Men  have  a  natural  disposition  towards  metaphysical 
thinking,  and  we  must  ask  'How  is  metaphysics  possible  as  a 
natural  disposition?'  We  cannot,  however,  be  satisfied  merely 
with  an  answer  to  this  question.  We  want  to  know  whether 
our  metaphysical  questions  can,  or  can  not,  be  answered. 
Hence  we  have  a  second  question,  'How  is  metaphysics  pos- 
sible as  a  science?' 

The  first  question  is  'How  is  it  that  the  problems  of  meta- 
physics necessarily  arise  in  our  experience?'1  The  second 
question  is  'How  can  these  problems  be  solved?' 

Kant  believes  that  his  Copernican  revolution  will  re-establish 
metaphysics  as  a  science.  It  will  introduce  a  new  kind  of  meta- 
physics, which  will  decide  whether  metaphysics  can,  or  can  not, 
deal  with  these  problems.  It  will  enable  us  with  confidence 
either  to  extend  the  use  of  pure  reason  or  to  set  it  definite  limits.2 

The  latter  alternative  is  the  actual  result  of  the  Kritik. 
Kant's  metaphysics,  as  we  have  seen,3  professes  to  give  us 
certain  and  a  priori  knowledge  within  the  limits  of  experience. 
If  we  seek  to  go  beyond  the  limits  of  experience,  we  must  do 
so,  not  by  knowledge,  but  by  faith. 

§  5.  Analytic  and  Synthetic  Judgements 

The  turning-point  of  this  discussion  is  the  distinction 
between  analytic  and  synthetic  judgements. 

At  first  sight  no  distinction  would  seem  to  be  simpler. 

1  This  is  not  for  Kant  a  psychological  question.  He  is  asking  why 
reason  must  necessarily  raise  certain  problems. 

2  B  22.  8  Chapter  II  §  8. 


Ill  §  5]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  83 

Either  the  predicate  B  belongs  to  the  subject  A  as  something 
which  is  contained  (covertly)  in  the  concept  of  A — this  is  an 
analytic  judgement :  or  else  the  predicate  B  lies  entirely  outside 
the  concept  of  A,  although  it  is  connected  with  it — this  is 
a  synthetic  judgement.1 

All  analytic  judgements,  as  we  saw  above,  are  a  priori.  It 
makes  no  difference  whether  the  subject-concept  is  itself 
empirical  or  a  priori  \  for  if  the  concept  is  given,  we  require 
no  further  appeal  to  experience  to  make  the  judgement.  Ex- 
amples of  analytic  judgements  are  'Gold  is  yellow',  and  'All 
triangles  are  three-sided  figures'. 

Synthetic  judgements  may  be  either  a  posteriori  or  a  priori. 
'Gold  is  found  in  Siberia'  is  a  synthetic  a  posteriori  judgement. 
'All  triangles  have  the  three  interior  angles  equal  to  two  right 
angles'  is  a  synthetic  a  priori  judgement.  In  both  cases  the 
predicate  adds  something  which  is  not  thought  in  the  concept 
of  the  subject,  but  the  second  judgement  is  characterised 
by  necessity  and  universality,  and  is  therefore  a  priori  as  well 
as  synthetic. 

Is  this  distinction  of  analytic  and  synthetic  a  subjective 
distinction,  so  that  what  is  analytic  for  one  man  would  be 
synthetic  for  another?  Kant's  language  in  places  might  suggest 
that  the  distinction  is  subjective;  but  this,  I  think,  is  true  only 
where  the  subject-concept  is  empirical.  Thus,  speaking  of 
empirical  concepts,  he  says  that  one  man  can  think  in  the 
concept  of  gold  a  quality  (such  as  not  rusting)  of  which  another 
man  may  know  nothing.2  This  is  obviously  true,  since  empirical 
concepts  are  derived  from  experience,  and  the  experience  of 
different  men  is  different.  Hence  it  seems  rather  artificial 
to  regard  as  a  priori  those  analytic  judgements  whose  subject- 
concept  is  empirical.  'Gold  is  yellow'  is  surely  no  more  a  priori 
than  the  judgement  'The  house  will  fall  in,  if  its  foundations 
are  undermined';  and  this  Kant  refuses  to  call  completely 
a  priori? 

1  A  6  =  B  10.  It  should  be  observed  that  in  B  19  Kant  claims 
his  distinction  to  be  a  novel  one.  2  A  728  =  B  756. 

3  B  2.  On  the  other  hand,  it  seems  not  unreasonable  to  say 
that  the  judgement  'All  bodies  are  extended*  is  an  analytic  judge- 


84  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §  6 

In  dealing  with  analytic  judgements  Kant  is  primarily 
concerned  with  those  in  which  the  subject-concept  is  itself 
a  priori.  Such  judgements  he  believes  to  be  of  real  importance 
in  philosophy.  Here  he  certainly  regards  the  concept  as  con- 
taining 'marks'1  which  cohere  through  the  nature  of  the  concept 
itself,  and  not  through  the  accident  of  the  individual's  ex- 
perience. 

We  must  presume  that  the  distinction  between  analytic  and 
synthetic  judgements  implies  a  difference  in  the  relation  of 
subject-concept  to  predicate-concept  which,  so  far  as  it  has 
any  importance,  does  not  differ  for  different  persons.  Kant 
does  not  mean  his  distinction  to  be  merely  a  subjective  one. 

§  6.  Analytic  Judgements 

The  analytic  judgement,  although  it  takes  place  by  means 
of  analysis  of  the  subject-concept,  is  not  a  judgement  about 
the  concept,2  but  about  the  objects  which  are  supposed  to  fall 
under  the  concept.  'All  bodies  are  extended'  is  not  a  judgement 
about  the  concept  of  body,  but  about  bodies  themselves.3 
Some  analytic  judgements  of  metaphysics  may  have  no  object, 
but  their  authors  intend  them  to  refer  to  an  object. 

Still  less  is  the  analytic  judgement  about  the  meaning 
of  a  word.  Words  unfortunately  do  not  contain  their  own 
meaning.  It  would  be  easier  to  learn  foreign  languages  if 
they  did. 

An  analytic  judgement  is  not  a  mere  tautology,  like  'Man 
is  man*.  Kant  sometimes  describes  the  relation  of  predicate 
to  subject  in  an  analytic  judgement  as  one  of  identity,  but  he 
does  not  mean  that  the  subject  and  the  predicate  are  the  same. 

ment.  We  could  not  know  bodies  at  all  without  knowing  that  they 
are  extended,  but  a  blind  man  might  know  gold  without  knowing 
that  it  is  yellow. 

1  'Merkmale*.  These  may  be  taken  as  'partial*  concepts  which 
together  constitute  the  whole  concept;  see  Chapter  IX  §  4. 

2  Hermann  Cohen  and  Kinkel  maintain  that  it  is,  but  this  seems 
to  me  both  false  in  itself  and  un-Kantian;  compare  A  736  ==  B  764. 

8  Compare  A  68-9  =  B  93-4.  The  example  there  is  'AH  bodies  are 
divisible'— an  analytic  judgement. 


Ill  §  6]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  85 

Analytic  judgements  make  explicit  in  the  predicate  what  is 
only  implicit  in  the  subject-concept.1 

The  difficulty,  however,  is  to  know  what  is  implicit,  and 
what  is  not  implicit,  in  a  concept.  It  might  seem  to  be  implicit 
in  the  concept  of  triangle  that  the  interior  angles  are  equal 
to  two  right  angles ;  but  this  Kant  would  deny  to  be  an  analytic 
judgement. 

It  might  be  thought  that  by  analytic  judgements  Kant 
meant  definitions,  or  at  any  rate  judgements  which  state  either 
the  essence,  or  part  of  the  essence,  of  a  thing.  Even  so,  there 
are  obvio.us  difficulties  as  to  what  constitutes  the  essence  of 
a  thing.  This  view  is,  in  any  case,  not  the  view  of  Kant  himself. 
He  resents  any  attempt  to  equate  his  distinction  of  analytic 
and  synthetic  judgements  with  the  distinctions  previously 
recognised  in  logic.2 

The  logic  of  the  time  recognised  the  following  distinctions.8 
The  essence  consists  of  certain  primitive  and  constitutive 
marks  called  strictly  essentialia.  The  attributes  have  their 
sufficient  ground  in  the  essence,  and  are  derivative  from  it.4 
The  modes  (inner  determinations)  and  relations  (external 
relations)  are  not  so  derivative.5 

1  Log.  §37  (IX  in).   It  should  be  unnecessary  to  observe  that 
analytic  judgements  are  made  by  the  analysis  of  a  concept  (the  subject- 
concept)  and  not  by  analysis  of  a  thing  (the  subject) ;  yet  I  find  con- 
fusion on  this  point,  not  only  in  beginners,  but  in  commentaries  on 
Kant.  It  is  by  synthetic  judgements  that  we  make  analyses  of  things. 

2  Streitschrift,  2.  Abschn.  (VIII  228  ff),  which  is  the  locus  dassicus 
for  this  question;  compare  also  B  19.  To  treat  this  distinction  as 
familiar  to  Kant's  predecessors — and  this  is  the  prevalent  view — is 
to  get  a  distorted  idea  of  Kant's  thinking. 

8  Compare  Log.  EM.  VIII  (IX  60-1);  Streitschrift,  2.  Abschn. 
(VIII  228  ff);  Metaphysik,  p.  24;  G.  F.  Meier,  Auszug  §  121 ;  Baum- 
garten,  Metaphysica  §  50  (XVII  37).  See  also  Chapter  XXXIX  §  3. 

4  The  essentials  in  the  strict  sense  and  the  attributes  are  sometimes 
described  together  as  essentialia  (or  ad  essentiam  pertinentia).  All 
other  marks,  whether  modes  or  relations,  are  described  as  extra- 
essentialia. 

6  If  the  essence  is  present,  the  attributes  must  be  present,  but 
the  modes  and  relations  need  not  be.  Thus  a  man  may  be  rational 
(the  essence)  without  being  either  learned  (a  mode)  or  a  master 
(a  relation). 


86  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §  7 

Although  all  attributes  have  their  sufficient  ground  in  the 
essence,  some  must  be  known  by  analytic,  and  others  by 
synthetic,  judgements.1  Thus  in  the  judgement  'All  bodies  are 
divisible',  divisibility  is  an  attribute  grounded  on  extension, 
which  is  part  of  the  essence  of  body.  Given  the  concept  of  body 
and  the  law  of  non-contradiction,  we  can  make  the  judgement, 
which  is  consequently  analytic.  On  the  other  hand  in  the 
judgement  'All  substances  are  permanent,'  permanence  is  an 
attribute  grounded  on  the  essence  of  substance,  but  it  is  not 
contained  implicitly  in  the  concept  of  substance.2  Given  the 
concept  of  substance,  we  cannot  assert,  merely  by  the  law 
of  non-contradiction,  that  all  substances  are  permanent. 
Hence  the  judgement,  although  a  priori ,  is  synthetic. 

The  distinction  between  analytic  and  synthetic  judgements 
therefore  cannot  be  made  by  reference  to  the  distinction 
between  essence  and  attributes. 

Kant's  theory  is  not  so  simple  as  it  looks,  and  the  nature 
of  analytic  judgements  is  not  altogether  clear.  Our  main 
concern  is,  however,  with  synthetic  judgements. 

§  7.  Synthetic  Judgements 

Of  synthetic  judgements  we  can  say  three  things.  Firstly, 
the  predicate  contains  more  than  is  contained,  even  covertly, 
in  the  subject-concept.  Secondly  (another  way  of  saying  the 
same  thing),  given  the  subject-concept,  we  cannot,  merely  by 
the  law  of  non-contradiction,  make  the  judgement.  Thirdly, 
to  make  a  synthetic  judgement  we  require,  in  addition  to  the 
subject-concept,  something  else  or  what  Kant  calls  a  third 
thing.  For  the  present  we  may  describe  this  as  intuition — 
empirical  intuition  if  the  judgement  is  a  posteriori,  pure  intuition 
if  the  judgement  is  a  priori?  The  third  point,  however,  cannot 

1  Kant  accordingly  speaks  of  analytic  and  synthetic  attributes. 

2  The  concept  of  substance  is  here  the  concept  of  the  ultimate 
subject  of  all  predicates.  In  A  184  =  6227  Kant  himself  says  that 
the  proposition  *  Substance  is  permanent'  is  tautological;  but  there 
presumably  he  has  in  mind,  not  the  pure,  but  the  schematised, 
category.  Compare  Chapter  XXXIII  §  4. 

8  We  shall  find  later  that  this  requires  qualification;  see  Chapter 
XXXV  §  4. 


Ill  §  8]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  87 

be  assumed  at  the  present  stage,  since  it  is  what  Kant  hopes 
to  prove. 

The  judgement  that  the  three  interior  angles  of  a  triangle 
are  equal  to  two  right  angles  is  a  synthetic  judgement,  because 
it  cannot  be  made,  according  to  Kant,  apart  from  intuition. 
It  states  a  necessary  attribute  of  all  triangles,  but  not  one 
which  can  be  discovered  by  analysing  the  concept  of  triangle. 

Whatever  be  the  difficulties  of  the  distinction,  it  can  hardly 
be  denied  that  we  make  synthetic  judgements,  and  some 
of  these  appear  to  be  a  priori.  If  so,  Kant  has  a  real  problem. 

We  might  indeed  raise  objections  of  a  more  fundamental 
kind.  Perhaps  it  is  a  false  view  to  regard  judgement  as  an 
advance  from  the  concept  of  the  subject  to  the  predicate 
either  by  analysis  or  by  synthesis.  Perhaps  every  judgement 
is  essentially  both  analytic  and  synthetic,1  necessarily  analysing 
a  whole  into  its  parts,  and  at  the  same  time  binding  together 
the  parts  in  a  whole.  Perhaps  it  is  only  in  material  operations, 
such  as  cutting  wood  and  building  houses,  that  analysis  and 
synthesis,  breaking  up  and  putting  together,  can  be  separated 
from  one  another.  These  and  similar  objections  are  highly 
relevant  to  a  theory  of  predication,  but  they  obscure,  rather 
than  illumine,  the  problem  which  presented  itself  to  Kant. 

§  8.  Kant's  Problem 

Kant's  central  problem  is  'How  are  synthetic  a  priori  judge- 
ments possible?' 

This  question  is  not  concerned  with  subjective  possibility. 
It  does  not  ask  how  we  come  to  make  such  judgements,  but 
how  such  judgements  can  be  made  truly.2  Truth  for  Kant 
implies  correspondence  with  reality,  and  his  question,  at  least 
in  regard  to  mathematical  judgements,  has  two  sides.  He  is 
asking  how  we  can  pass,  on  a  priori  grounds,  from  a  subject- 

1  I  hope  to  show  later  that  for  Kant  himself  both  analysis  and 
synthesis  are  present  in  all  judgements;  see  Chapter  XIV  §  i.  But  to 
say  this  is  to  use  the  words  in  a  different  sense. 

2  The  case  of  metaphysics  is  rather  different,  but  even  there  we 
do  not  ask  how  we  come  to  make  metaphysical  judgements — a  psycho- 
logical question. 


88  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §  8 

concept  to  a  predicate  not  contained  in  it — as  we  do  in  pure 
mathematics.  He  is  also  asking  how  such  synthetic  a  priori 
judgements  can  be  true  of  reality — how  for  example  mathe- 
matical judgements  can  apply  to  the  actual  world.  These  two 
questions  are  different,  but  are  not  always  distinguished  by 
Kant  with  sufficient  clarity. 

Kant  does  not  concern  himself  at  first  with  the  question 
how  synthetic  a  posteriori  judgements  are  possible.1  His 
explanation  is  that,  in  addition  to  the  subject-concept,  we  must 
have  something  else  which  justifies  us  in  ascribing  to  the  subject 
a  predicate  not  contained  in  the  subject-concept.  That  'some- 
thing else'  is  our  complete  experience  of  the  objecc  which  is 
referred  to  by  the  subject-concept. 

Such  is  the  common-sense  answer  to  the  question,  and  at 
this  stage  it  is  sufficient.  For  common  sense,  however,  the 
object  is  the  thing-in-itself .  When  Kant  argues  later  that  the 
thing-in-itself  cannot  be  an  object  of  experience,  it  becomes 
incumbent  upon  him  to  explain  what  an  object  of  experience 
can  be.  This  is  one  of  the  questions  with  which  Kant's  philo- 
sophy will  deal.2 

The  main  point  of  Kant's  problem,  however,  is  this.  In 
synthetic  a  posteriori  judgements  we  have  a  third  thing,  namely 
experience  of  the  object  (and  ultimately  empirical  intuition), 
which  justifies  us  in  making  our  synthesis  of  subject  and 
predicate.  Where  are  we  to  find  a  third  thing  to  justify  our 
synthetic  a  priori  judgements  ?  Such  a  third  thing  we  must 
have,  because  ex  hypothesi  we  cannot  pass  to  the  predicate 
by  mere  analysis  of  the  subject-concept.  And  clearly  the 
third  thing  cannot  be  experience;  for  experience  can  give 
us  only  matter  of  fact,  and  cannot  give  us  that  strict  necessity 
and  universality  which  is  asserted  in  a  priori  judgements. 
The  justification  of  synthetic  a  priori  judgements  in  mathe- 

1  A  8,  B  12. 

2  A  104  ff. ;  A  189  =  B  234  ff. ;   etc.    I   can   see   no   reason    to 
charge  Kant  with  inconsistency  because  he  does  not  deal  with  this 
problem  in  his  Introduction,  but  gives  us  a  common-sense  answer. 
It  happens  also  to  be  the  true  answer,  and  it  remains  true  even  when 
we  come  to  recognise  that  there  is  an  a  priori  element  in  all  experience. 


Ill  §  9]       SYNTHETIC  A  PRIORI  JUDGEMENTS  89 

matics,  in  physics,  and  in  metaphysics,  will  in  each  case  depend 
on  whether  or  not  we  can  find  this  third  thing  on  which  to 
ground  the  synthesis.  When  we  have  found  it  for  mathematics 
and  for  physics,  we  shall  have  a  deeper  insight,  not  only  into 
the  nature  of  synthetic  a  priori  judgements,  but  also  into  the 
nature  of  our  ordinary  experience. 

§  9.  The  Reality  of  Kant's  Problem 

The  only  way  to  deny  the  reality  of  Kant's  problem  is  to 
deny  the  existence  of  synthetic  a  priori  judgements,  and  to 
assert  that  judgements  which  seem  to  be  such  are  either  not 
synthetic  or  not  a  priori. 

Mathematical  judgements  certainly  seem  to  be  a  priori\ 
and  even  if  we  seek  to  overcome  the  absolute  antithesis  between 
a  posteriori  and  a  priori,  we  can  hardly  deny  that  there  is  a  real 
difference  between  mathematical  judgements  and  judgements 
of  the  type  'All  swans  are  white'.  Such  a  difference  requires 
investigation.  It  may,  however,  be  maintained  that  all  mathe- 
matical judgements  are  analytic.  This  view  is  the  predominant 
view  of  mathematical  logicians  at  the  present  time;  and  if  it 
is  true,  it  cuts  the  ground  from  under  Kant's  feet. 

As  regards  Kant's  second  type  of  judgement  (which  forms 
the  basis  of  physical  science)  a  different  line  would  have 
to  be  taken.  *  Every  event  has  a  cause'  is  certainly  not  an  analytic 
judgement.  If  we  are  to  reject  Kant's  starting-point,  we  must 
deny  that  it  is  an  a  priori  judgement,  and  assert  either  that 
it  is  false,  or  else  that  it  is  a  mere  hypothesis  or  postulate. 
Neither  of  these  views  is  to  be  lightly  dismissed,  but  each  has 
its  own  difficulties. 

The  third  or  metaphysical  type  of  judgement — e.g.  'The 
world  has  no  beginning  in  time' — is  of  less  importance  as 
a  starting-point,  but  it  obviously  is  not  analytic,  and  it  does 
not  rest  on  experience.  The  question  whether  such  a  judgement 
can  properly  claim  truth  is  an  important  question. 

The  nature  of  mathematical  thinking  and  its  relation  to  the 
empirical  world,  the  ultimate  presuppositions  of  physical 
science,  the  possibility  of  a  metaphysical  knowledge  trans- 


90  KANT'S  PROBLEM  [III  §9 

cending  our  finite  experience — these  are  three  fundamental 
problems,  which  still  are,  and  are  likely  to  remain,  of  the 
most  pressing  concern  to  philosophy.  Kant  professes  that  he 
is  able  to  solve  them,  and  it  would  be  foolish  to  quarrel  with 
the  terms  in  which  they  are  stated.  Our  task  is  to  see  what 
his  solution  is.  And  although  there  are  difficulties  about  his 
starting-point,  we  may  perhaps  still  claim  that  his  initial 
assumptions  are  sufficiently  plausible  to  justify  us  in  sub- 
jecting his  argument  to  further  examination.

CHAPTER    IV 
SENSE   AND    SENSIBILITY 

§  i .  The  Transcendental  Aesthetic 

The  Kritik  of  Pure  Reason,  as  a  transcendental  science, 
is  concerned  with  our  way  of  knowing  objects,  so  far  as  that 
is  possible  a  priori* 

Our  way  of  knowing  objects  is  by  means  of  sensibility  and 
understanding  (two  powers  which  may  have  a  common  root).2 
We  must  consider  whether  each  of  these  contributes  an 
a  priori  element  to  knowledge.  The  part  of  the  Kritik  which 
deals  with  the  a  priori  element  contributed  by  sense  is  the 
Transcendental  Aesthetic.  For  this  purpose  Kant  first  of  all 
isolates  sensibility  ;3  that  is  to  say,  he  excludes  from  considera- 
tion everything  contributed  to  our  knowledge  of  objects 
by  thought  or  understanding.  Secondly,  he  isolates  the  a  priori 
element  contributed  by  sensibility.  He  does  so  by  excluding 
everything  that  belongs  to  empirical  sensation.  This  method 
of  elimination  will  leave  us  with  pure  intuitions,  or  the  pure 
forms  of  intuition,  which  we  shall  find  to  be  space  and  time.4 

§2.  Intuition 

At  the  beginning  of  the  Aesthetic  Kant  gives  us  a  rather 
complicated  explanation  of  the  terms  which  he  employs. 
There  is  a  considerable  element  of  ambiguity  in  what  he  says, 
and  the  full  meaning  of  his  terms  can  be  grasped  only  from 
their  use  as  the  argument  develops.5  It  is  a  mistake  to  regard 

1  B  25.  It  excludes  from  its  consideration  such  a  priori  knowledge 
as  arises  from  mere  analysis  of  concepts,  and  it  examines  only  the 
sources  and  limits  of  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge. 

It  excludes  also  the  practical  synthetic  a  priori  judgements  of 
morality.  Compare  A  14-15  —  B  28-9  and  Grundlegung  (IV  420). 

2  A  15  =  B  29.

all  his  statements  as  premises,  and  a  still  greater  mistake 
to  suppose  that  he  is  setting  forth  complete  arguments.1  We 
must  take  what  he  says  partly  as  a  statement  of  what  he  intends 
to  prove;  and  this  cannot  be  completely  understood  on  the 
common -sense  level  on  which  we  might  naturally  be  supposed 
to  begin.2 

I  propose  to  deal  only  with  some  points  of  general  importance. 
For  Kant  sensibility  is  essentially  passive,  while  under- 
standing is  active.  The  former  is  a  receptivity  or  capacity;3 
the  latter  an  activity  or  power.4  Sensibility  alone  is  the  source 
of  intuitions,  while  understanding  is  the  source  of  concepts. 
An  intuition  is  a  singular  idea5  (repraesentatio  singularis)\ 
a  concept  is  a  general  idea  (repraesentatio  per  notas  communes) , 
an  idea  of  what  is  common  to  different  objects.6 

As  has  often  been  pointed  out,7  there  is  a  certain  ambiguity 
in  words  like  'intuition*.  'My  intuition'  may  mean  'my  intuiting* 
or  'what  I  intuit*.  This  ambiguity  is  to  be  found  in  Kant, 

1  In  particular  the  statement  that  the  form  of  appearances  (or  sen- 
sations) must  lie  a  priori  in  the  mind  (A  20  =  B  34)  should,  I  think, 
be  taken,  not  as  a  premise,  but  as  a  statement  of  what  is  to  be  proved, 
It  is  true  that  this  statement  is  supported  by  what  looks  like  an  argu- 
ment— 'that  in  which  alone  sensations  can  be  arranged  and  posited 
in  a  certain  form  cannot  itself  be  sensation*.  This  seems  to  me  to  be 
a  summary  of  the  main  argument  of  the  Aesthetic  rather  than  an 
attempt  to  establish  a  premise  for  that  argument.  If  we  regard  it  as 
establishing  Kant's  premises  it  is  hopelessly  inadequate. 

2  The  beginner  is  well  advised  not  to  linger  too  long  over  these 
preliminary  difficulties. 

3  Rezeptivitdt  or  Fahigkeit.  A  19  =  B  33. 

4  Spontaneitdt  or  Vermb'gen.  A  51  =  675.  The  use  of  Fahigkeit 
and  Vermb'gen  is,  however,  not  consistent.  There  seems  to  be  no 
general  term  which  covers  both.  For  the  general  term  either  may  be 
used,  although  I  think  the  latter  is  the  word  more  commonly  employed. 

6  Vorstellung.  This  is  a  general  term  which  covers  both  intuition 
(Anschauung)  and  concept  (Begriff).  I  usually  prefer  to  translate  it 
as  'idea*  rather  than  as  'representation'.  It  is  sometimes  used  for 
'my  intuiting*  or  'thinking'  as  well  as  for  'what  I  intuit'  or  'what  I 
think*.  Where  the  former  sense  seems  prominent  I  sometimes  use 
'representation*  as  more  suggestive  of  an  act.

7  Kant  himself  points  it  out  very  clearly  in  a  passage  the  reference 
to  which  I  have  unfortunately  lost. 


IV  §  2]  SENSE  AND  SENSIBILITY  95 

Thus  he  refers  to  'the  indeterminate  object  of  an  empirical 
intuition',1  where  'intuition'  would  appear  to  mean  'intuiting*. 
On  the  other  hand  he  speaks  of  space  and  time  as  intuitions  and 
not  concepts.  Here  he  must  mean  that  they  are  individual  things 
intuited  and  not  merely  common  characters  conceived.2 

There  is,  however,  a  special  reason  for  this  latter  usage. 
It  must  be  remembered  that  Kant  is  not  a  representative 
idealist  (except  in  so  far  as  he  considers  our  ideas  to  be  ap- 
pearances of  unknown  things-in-themselves).  Space  and  time 
have  for  him  no  reality  apart  from  human  minds.  They  are  not 
things-in-themselves,  which  happen  also  to  be  intuited.  Their 
whole  being  depends  on  our  intuiting,  and  calling  them  in- 
tuitions or  ideas  serves  to  bring  out  this  view.3 

Intuitions  in  human  beings  are  sensuous.  That  is  to  say,  they 
come  to  us  by  means  of  passive  sensibility.  They  are  not 
created  by  us  but  simply  received.  We  are  able  to  intuit  only 
so  far  as  an  object  is  given  to  us,  and  an  object  is  given  to  us 
only  so  far  as  it  affects  our  minds4  and  produces  a  sensation. 

This  statement  is  difficult  because  of  the  ambiguity  of  the 
word  'object*.  The  simplest  interpretation  is  to  suppose  that 
Kant  is  speaking  on  the  common-sense  level.  The  object  may 
be  taken  to  be  a  body,  such  as  a  chair.  It  is  given  to  us  so  far 
as  it  affects  our  minds  through  the  sense-organs  and  produces, 
for  example,  a  sensation  of  colour. 

As  we  have  seen,5  Kant  analyses  the  object  of  common  sense 

1  A  20  =*  B  33-4. 

8  Space  and  time  (individual  things)  must  be  distinguished  from 
spatiality  and  temporality  (the  common  characters  of  all  spaces  and 
times). 

3  Similarly  an  object  such  as  a  house,  when  viewed  transcendentally, 
is  said  to  be,  not  a  thing-in-itself,  but  an  appearance  or  idea.  See 
A  190-1  =  B  235-6.  I  have  not  attempted  to  avoid  using  'intuition* 
for  'what  is  intuited* — or  other  expressions  of  the  same  kind.  The 
attempt  to  do  so  in  a  detailed  exposition  of  Kant  would  produce  too 
many  complications. 

4  'Gemiit'  (mind)  is  a  colourless  word  which  Kant  uses  to  avoid 
the  metaphysical  implications  of  'Seele*  (soul).  It  is  equivalent  to 
'Vorstellungsfdhigkeit*  (a  capacity  for  ideas).  See  A  19  =  B  34.

into  the  thing  as  it  is  in  itself  and  as  it  appears  to  us,  or  in 
other  words  into  the  thing-in-itself  and  the  phenomenal  object. 
If  we  suppose  this  analysis  to  be  already  made,  Kant's  statement 
(that  an  object  affects  our  minds  and  produces  a  sensation) 
applies  both  to  the  thing-in-itself  and  to  the  phenomenal  object.1 
The  thing  or  object  which  is  given  to  us  is,  however,  given 
to  us  only  as  it  appears,  not  as  it  is  in  itself.  It  is  in  short  given 
as  a  phenomenal  object.  If  we  speak  strictly,  even  the  pheno- 
menal object  is  given  only  as  regards  its  matter.2  What  is  given 
to  us  is,  for  example,  a  colour.  We  think  that  it  is  the  colour 
of  a  chair.  Without  thought,  although  we  might  see  a  colour,3 
we  could  not  know  that  it  was  the  colour  of  a  chair,  or  indeed 
of  anything.4  This  is  what  Kant  means  when  he  says  that 
intuitions  without  the  concepts  of  thought  are  blind.5  Hence 
without  thought  there  is  no  determinate  object,  no  phenomenal 
object  in  the  strict  sense.  What  is  given,  namely  the  mere 
sensum,  may  be  called  the  indeterminate  object,6  the  object 
as  a  mere  appearance7  to  sense  apart  from  thought. 

1  For  the  non-temporal  causality  of  the  thing-in-itself,  which  does 
not  affect  our  sense-organ  but  our  mind,  see  Chapter  II  §  2.  This 
may  be  what  Kant  has  chiefly  in  mind  in  the  present  passage.  For 
the  causality  of  the  phenomenal  object,  see  Chapter  II  §  3.  Sensations 
are  the  product  of  a  double  causality. 

2  At  the  present  stage  the  'matter*  may  be  taken  as  the  sensum, 
the  seen  colour  and  heard  sound.  In  some  places  the  matter  is  said 
to  be  the  sensation,  and  in  other  places  it  is  said  (as  in  A  20  =  B  34) 
to  correspond  to  the  sensation.  Compare  Chapter  XXXVIII  §  i. 

3  Synthesis,  and  perhaps  thought,  may  be  necessary  even  to  see  a 
colour,  but  this  we  may  for  the  present  ignore. 

4  To  know  this  we  require,  not  only  the  empirical  concept  of 
chair,  but  also  the  category  of  substance  and  accident. 

5  See  A  51  =  B75. 

6  See  A  20  =  B  34.  The  indeterminate  object  is  the  thing  (always 
in  the  last  resort  the  thing-in-itself)  as  it  appears  to  mere  sense. 
The  phenomenal  object  is  the  thing  as  it  appears  to  sense  and  thought. 
The  latter  alone  is  an  object,  if  we  speak  strictly. 

7  Compare  A  92  =  B  125.  A  248-9  suggests  that  the  indeterminate 
object  (intuition  undetermined  by  the  categories)  should  be  called  an 
'appearance*    (Erscheinung),    and    the    determinate    or   phenomenal 
object  should  be  called  a  'phenomenon*.  This  distinction  is  usually 
neglected  by  Kant. 


IV  §2]  SENSE  AND  SENSIBILITY  97 

At  the  present  stage  Kant  is  not  in  a  position  to  explain  the 
part  played  by  thought.  In  any  case  the  phenomenal  object, 
if  it  is  to  be  a  phenomenal  object,  must  both  be  given  to  sense 
and  be  thought  by  understanding.1  Hence  it  is  not  incorrect 
to  say  that  the  phenomenal  object  must  be  given  to  sense: 
it  can  indeed  be  given  in  no  other  way. 

Intuition  itself  may  be  analysed  into  form  and  matter.  The 
matter  is  the  sensation  or  sensum,2  which  may  also  be  called 
an  impression.3  This  is  the  Effect'  of  the  object  which  'affects' 
our  minds.4  The  form  is  the  space  and  time  in  which  our 
sensations  are  arranged  and  is  due,  as  Kant  hopes  to  prove, 
not  to  the  thing  affecting  us,  but  to  the  nature  of  our  minds. 

Intuition  is  immediately  related  to  an  individual  object5  and 
is  distinguished  from  thought  or  conception  by  being  so  related. 
Thought  is  always  mediate  or  discursive,8  always  related 
to  its  object  by  means  of  intuition.  Here  again  the  word  'object' 
is  ambiguous,  and  Kant  may  be  speaking  on  a  common-sense 
level.  If  we  insist  on  distinguishing  the  thing-in-itself  from 
the  phenomenal  object,  his  primary  concern  would  seem  to  be 
with  the  latter.  It  must  be  sufficient  to  say  at  present  that  the 

1  I  pass  over  the  fact  that  we  may  know  phenomenal  objects  not 
given  directly  to  our  senses,  if  they  are  connected  by  means  of  the 
Analogies  with  objects  which  are  so  given.  See  A  225  =  B  272  ff. 

2  See  A  42  =  B  60,  A  167  =  B  209,  and  compare  Fortschritte  der 
Metaphysik  (Phil.  Bib.  46c,  p.  91).   I  pass  over  the  difficulty  that 
the  matter  of  an  appearance  is  said  to  'correspond  to'  sensation. 
See  A  20  =  B  34. 

8  'Eindruck*  (impressio) ;  see  Fortschritte  der  Metaphysik  (PhiL  Bib. 
46c,  p.  91). 

4  A  19  =  B  34.  The  *  object*  here  is  again  ambiguous.  It  may  be 
taken,  primarily  at  least,  as  the  thing-in-itself. 

6  The  fact  that  this  relation  is  said  (in  A  20  =  B  34)  to  be  'through 
sensation*  does  not  make  it  mediate,  for  sensation  is  not  separable 
from  intuition,  but  is  an  element  within  it.  It  may  be  asked  whether 
'intuition*  in  this  context  means  'intuiting*  or  'the  content  of  intuition*. 
On  the  whole  Kant  would  seem  not  to  distinguish  these  clearly  in 
such  assertions.  In  intuiting  we  are  directly  or  immediately  aware 
of  the  object,  and  the  content  of  the  intuition  is  the  quality  of  the 
object.  The  object  consists  of  such  contents  combined  together  in 
accordance  with  the  categories.  Indeed  the  whole  object  may  be 
described  as  (the  content  of)  one  intuition.  6  See  Chapter  X  §  7. 
VOL.  I  D 


98  SPACE  AND  TIME  [IV  §  3 

phenomenal  object  (such  as  a  chair  or  a  table)  is  directly  and 
immediately  given  to  intuition.  Whatever  be  the  part  played 
by  thinking,  when  we  feel  the  hardness  and  see  the  colour 
of  a  chair,  our  minds  are  in  an  immediate  relation  to  the  chair, 
and  the  chair  is  so  far  immediately  present  to  our  minds.1 

§  3.  Sense  and  Understanding 

It  is  an  essential  part  of  Kant's  doctrine  that  both  sense  and 
understanding,  both  intuition  and  conception,  are  necessary 
for  knowledge  of  objects.2  Through  sense  objects  are  given, 
and  through  understanding  they  are  thought.3  Thoughts 
without  the  content  of  intuition  are  empty,  and  intuitions 
without  the  concepts  of  thought  are  blind.4 

There  is  therefore  an  abstraction  involved  in  dealing  with 
sensibility  by  itself,  and  the  Aesthetic  is  a  provisional  and 
incomplete  account  of  our  knowledge  of  space  and  time. 
In  awareness  of  space  and  time  as  individual  objects  thought 
is  always  involved.5  Thought  gives  us  the  synthesis  without 
which  there  is  no  unity  in  any  object.  This  necessary  synthesis 
is  in  the  Aesthetic  ignored,  but  there  is  no  more  reason  to 
suppose  that  Kant  was  unaware  of  this  fact  here,  than  there 
is  in  the  corresponding  parts  of  the  Prolegomena.  The  pro- 
visional exclusion  of  the  part  played  by  thought  must  always 
be  borne  in  mind. 

1  I  pass  over  many  difficulties  here  :  for  example,  that  the  secondary 
qualities  may  differ  for  different  individuals,  and  also  that  if  we  are 
to  have  intuition,  there  must  be  present  an  element  of  synthesis,  and 
so  of  imagination. 

2  When  Kant  speaks  either  of  sense  or  of  understanding  as  if  they 
gave  us  knowledge  in  separation  from  one  another,  this  is  a  loose 
employment  of  the  term  *  knowledge*.  In  the  phrase  'knowledge  of 
objects'  the  word  Objects'  refers  to  phenomenal  objects.

as  an  'object',  strictly  speaking  neither  space  nor  time  is  an  object. 
An  object  must  be  an  appearance  of  things-in-themselves  and  must 
be  given  in  empirical  intuiti6n.  Space  and  time  are  only  conditions 
of  objects,  but  we  may  call  them  individual  objects  by  a  kind  of 
analogy.  See  A  291  =  B  347,  and  compare  B  147  and  A  156-7  = 
B  195-6. 


IV  §  4]  SENSE  AND  SENSIBILITY  99 

§  4.  Outer  and  Inner  Sense 

Sense  for  Kant  covers  both  outer  and  inner  sense.1  By  outer 
sense  (which  includes  sight,  hearing,  etc.)  we  are  aware  of 
objects  in  space.2  By  inner  sense  we  are  aware  of  our  own 
states  of  mind  in  time.  Both  inner  and  outer  sense  give  us  only 
phenomena,  and  not  things-in-themselves. 

The  doctrine  of  inner  sense  has  often  been  criticised.  It 
gives  rise  to  difficult  problems,  both  in  Kant's  system  and  in 
itself.  Yet  in  itself  it  is  by  no  means  unreasonable.  For  Kant 
an  immediate  cognitive  relation  to  an  individual  object  is 
possible  only  through  intuition,  and  intuition  is  given  only 
by  means  of  sensibility.3  As  we  have  clearly  such  an  immediate 
cognitive  relation  tq  our  own  individual  states  of  mind,  it  is 
not  improper  to  say  that  we  have  an  inner  sense. 

It  must  be  remembered  that  by  states  of  mind  Kant  does 
not  mean  the  seeing  as  opposed  to  the  seen.  All  the  stuff  or 
matter  of  inner  sense  (so  far  as  it  is  matter  for  knowledge] 
comes  to  us  from  outer  sense.4  The  stuff  of  inner  and  the  stuff 
of  outer  sense  overlap,  if  they  do  not  coincide.5  By  inner  sense 

1  A  23 ;  =  B  38. 

2  I  think  the  word  'outer*  may  imply  also  that  we  are  in  contact 
with  something  other  than  ourselves. 

3  A  19  =  B  33.  Compare  Log.  §  i  (IX  91). 

4  B  XXXIX  n. ;   B  67;   compare  A  34  =  B  50,  and  A  34  =  B  51. 
The  phrase  in  brackets  may  exclude  feelings  and  desires  (and  perhaps 
thoughts),  which  are  also  known  through  inner  sense  (A  357-8). 
By  'matter  for  knowledge*  Kant  seems  to  mean  'matter  for  knowledge 
of  objects'  (as  opposed  to  subjects).  In  B  66  the  feeling  of  pleasure 
and  pain  and  the  will  are  excluded  from  things  in  knowledge  which 
belong  to  intuition.  This  exclusion  may  perhaps  qualify  the  assertion 
in  B  67,  where  the  ideas  of  outer  sense  are  said  to  constitute  the 
proper  stuff  with  which  we  occupy  our  mind.  If  Kant  holds  that  the 
matter  of  feelings  and  desires  comes  from  outer  sense,  we  certainly 
require  a  fuller  explanation  of  this  view.    In  A  357  he  denies  that 
thought,  feeling,  inclination,  or  resolution  can  be  objects  of  outer 
intuition. 

5  See  for  example  A  98-9,  and  compare  A  34  =  851,  where  Kant 
says  that  by  means  of  inner  intuition  we  grasp  also  all  outer  intuitions 
in  our  mind.  This  is  confirmed  by  Anthr.  §  7  and  §  9  (VII  141,  142 
and  144).  E.g.  Kant  says  sense-perceptions  can  be  called  only  inner 


ioo  SPACE  AND  TIME  [IV  §  4 

we  are  immediately  aware,  not  only  of  our  feelings  and  desires, 
but  also  of  the  stream  of  ideas  which,  whatever  else  they  are, 
are  for  Kant  modifications  or  states  of  our  minds.  Even  if 
colours  are  things-in-themselves,  or  qualities  of  things-in- 
themselves,  they  modify  or  qualify  the  mind  in  the  sense  of 
coming  before  it  at  one  time  and  not  at  another.  Of  this  fact 
we  are  immediately  aware.  Others  may  infer  that  I  am  seeing 
a  red  pillar-box  now,  and  they  may  be  right.  But  I,  and  I 
alone,  can  have  immediate  knowledge  of  its  presence  to  my 
mind  at  the  moment.  Such  immediate  knowledge  is  for  Kant 
impossible  apart  from  sensuous  (or  passive)  intuition.  It  is 
concerned  with  something  internal  or  private  to  ourselves,1 
and  therefore  Kant  speaks  of  inner  as  opposed  to  outer  sense.2 

It  is  more  remarkable  that  just  as  space  is  the  form  of  outer 
sense,  so  time  is  the  form  of  inner  sense.  This  means  that  time 
cannot  be  intuited  outwardly,  any  more  than  space  can  be 
intuited  as  something  in  us.3 

The  use  of  the  words  'inside'  and  'outside'  in  regard  to  the 
mind  always  leads  to  confusion.  Space,  for  example,  is  certainly 
'in  us',  if  to  be  'in  us'  means  to  be  an  object  of  knowledge. 
It  is  also  'in  us'  as  well  as  outside  of  us,  if  to  be  'in  us'  means 
to  be  in  our  bodies.4 

Nevertheless,  if  we  may  put  Kant's  point  in  another  way, 
our  minds  seem  to  last  through  time,  as  they  do  not  seem  to 
extend  through  space.  We  are  immediately  aware  only  of 
colours  or  other  sensa,  and  perhaps  bodies,  as  in  space.  If  we 

appearances.  Compare  Die  falsche  Spitzfindigkeit  (II  60),  where  inner 
sense  is  said  to  be  the  power  of  making  one's  own  ideas  an  object 
of  one's  thought. 

1  In  the  sense  that  I  alone  have  immediate  knowledge  of  a  thing's 
presence  before  my  mind.  This  does  not  mean  that  the  thing  present 
to  my  mind  is  itself  necessarily  a  private,  and  not  a  common,  object. 

8  The  doctrine  of  'inner  sense*  is  to  be  found  not  only  in  Locke, 
Essay  II,  i,  Sect.  2  ff.,  but  in  Baumgarten,  Metaphysica  §  535  (XV  13). 
According  to  Erdmann  (Kriticismus,  p.  51)  it  is  also  to  be  found  in 
Tetens,  Philosophische  Versuche,  Bd.  I,  Versuch  I,  No.  VII. 

8  A  23  =  B  37.  Compare  Chapter  VII  §  2. 

4  In  A  373  'outside  us*  (when  it  does  not  refer  to  things-in-them- 
selves) means  simply  'in  space*. 


IV  §  s]  SENSE  AND  SENSIBILITY  101 

think  of  minds  as  being  in  space,  we  do  so  because  we  ascribe 
to  them  the  space  occupied  by  the  body  with  which  they  seem 
to  be  connected.  On  the  other  hand,  we  seem  to  be  immediately 
aware  of  our  minds  as  living  through  time,  or  at  least  to  be 
immediately  aware  of  the  stream  of  our  ideas  as  continuing 
through  time. 

Kant's  view  implies  that  we  are  immediately  aware  only 
of  our  own  mental  evolution  as  in  time,  and  that  we  have  not 
this  immediate  awareness  of  the  changes  in  the  physical  world. 
The  negative  side  of  this  contention  must  be  considered  later.1 

No  attempt  is  made  by  Kant  to  show  by  a  priori  reasoning 
that  there  must  be  inner  and  outer  senses,  or  that  there  must 
be  two  pure  forms  of  intuition  and  two  only.  This  has  simply 
to  be  accepted  as  a  fact.2  He  does,  however,  argue  that  other 
ideas — such  as  motion  and  change — which  belong  to  sensibility 
presuppose  something  empirical.3 

Kant's  theory  of  inner  sense  must  be  reserved  for  subsequent 
consideration.4  It  is  commonly  held  that  this  part  of  his  doctrine 
is  confused,  and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  ought  to  have 
received  fuller  treatment.  All  I  maintain  here  is  that  it  is  not 
to  be  dismissed  at  the  outset  as  obviously  unreasonable.5 

§  5.  The  Form  of  Intuition 

At  first  sight  Kant  seems  to  use  expressions  like  'form  of 
appearances',  'form  of  sensibility',  'form  of  intuition',  and  'pure 
intuition',  almost  as  if  they  were  interchangeable.6  It  is  im- 
portant to  distinguish  these  from  one  another,  even  if  in  so 
doing  we  make  Kant's  exposition  a  little  tidier  than  it  actually 
is.  We  are  here  concerned  with  the  meaning  of  these  expres- 
sions, not  with  their  justification  or  truth. 

Everything  that  appears  to  sense  must  be  capable  of  being 

1  See  Chapter  VII  §2.  2  B  146 

3  A  41  =  B  58;  B  3.  4  See  Chapters  LII-LIII. 

6  The  fact  that  there  is  no  physical  organ  of  inner  sense,  as  there 
is  of  the  outer  senses,  is  irrelevant.  The  characteristic  of  sense  for 
Kant  is  not  its  relation  to  a  physical  organ,  but  simply  its  passivity.

ica  SPACE  AND  TIME  [IV  §  5 

ordered  in  spatial  and  temporal  relations.1  Space  and  time  are 
the  conditions  of  such  ordering,  and  so  are  the  conditions  of 
the  possibility  of  appearances.  As  such,  space  and  time  are 
forms  of  appearances? 

As  forms  of  all  appearances  space  and  time  are  known  to  be 
necessary  and  universal.  Hence  we  may  say  that  our  ideas  of 
space  and  time  are  a  priori  or  pure3 — they  cannot  be  dependent 
on  experience  or  sense-perception,  which  can  never  give  us 
strict  universality  or  necessity.  On  Kant's  theory  such  ideas 
must  be  due  to  the  nature  of  the  knowing  mind,  in  this  case 
to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.  This  implies  further  that  the 
content  of  our  ideas,4  namely  space  and  time  themselves,  are 
due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.  They  are  forms  under 
which  alone  we  can  sense  appearances,  and  are  necessarily 
imposed  on  appearances  by  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.  This 
doctrine  is  expressed  in  the  statement  that  space  and  time  are 
forms  of  sensibility? 

On  this  view  space  and  time  are  potentially  present  in  our 
sensibility  even  before  experience  begins.  I  do  not  think  Kant 
believes  that  space  and  time  are  actually  present  to  our  minds 
before  experience  begins.6  But  the  expression  'form  of  sensi- 

1  634;  compare  A  20.   Such  relations  are  'outside'  and  'beside* 
for  space,  and  'before*  and  'after'  for  time.  It  is  difficult  to  be  sure 
whether   Kant   attaches   any  special   meaning   to  'capable  of  being 
ordered*  (geordnet  werden  kann).  This  is  peculiar  to  the  second  edition. 
It  is  perhaps  possible  that  he  is  alluding  vaguely  to  the  necessity  of 
synthesis  in  our  apprehension  of  objects  as  spatially  and  temporally 
related. 

2  'Appearances'  is  here  used  in  a  neutral  sense.  It  is  not  yet  implied 
that  appearances  are  mind-dependent. 

8  See  B  3-4  and  compare  Chapter  III  §2.  In  A  21  =  634  ideas 
are  said  to  be  pure  'in  the  transcendental  sense*  when  they  contain 
nothing  belonging  to  sensation.  This  takes  into  account  the  question 
of  origin,  but  only  in  a  negative  way.  The  statement  that  such  ideas 
are  due  to  the  nature  of  the  mind  is  a  further  step. 

4  As  we  saw  above,  Kant  himself  does  not  make  this  distinction, 
but  speaks  of  space  and  time  as  ideas. 

5  This  definitely  commits  us  to  the  subjective  character  and  origin 
of  space  and  time.  The  phrase  'form  of  appearance*  does  not  so 
commit  us,  though  when  we  think  it  out,  it  implies  this  conclusion.

bility'  has  a  certain  ambiguity.  It  may  be  applied,  not  to  space 
and  time,  but  to  that  characteristic  of  our  sensibility  in  virtue 
of  which  we  can  sense  things  only  in  temporal  and  spatial 
relations.  This  characteristic  does  exist  in  every  human  being 
even  before  experience  begins.1 

There  is  a  clear  distinction  between  'form  of  appearance' 
and  'form  of  sensibility',  the  latter  alone  implying  the  subjec- 
tivity of  space  and  time. 

'Form  of  intuition'  may  be  taken  as  equivalent  to  'form 
of  appearance',  so  far  as  'intuition'  is  equivalent  to  'appear- 
ance'. So.  far  as  'intuition'  means  'intuiting',  'form  of 
intuition'  is  akin  to  'form  of  sensibility'  (or  'form  of  sense'); 
it  has  then  the  same  subjective  implication  and  the  same 
ambiguity.2 

Form  is  essentially  the  form  of  matter,  and  when  we  speak 
of  space  and  time  as  'forms',  it  is  convenient  to  think  of  them 
as  the  relations  in  which  our  sensa  are  given.  We  might  perhaps 
even  say  that  they  are  the  whole  scheme  or  system  of  relations 
in  which  sensa  are  given.3  Sensa  are  given  as  outside  and 
beside  others,  and  before  and  after  others.  Space  and  time  are 
the  ultimate  system  of  relations  which  make  such  particular 
relations  possible.  They  are  thus  the  conditions  under  which 
alone  sensa  can  be  ordered  in  such  particular  relations.4 

§  6.  Pure  Intuition 

When  we  separate  the  form  from  the  matter,  that  is  to  say, 
when  we  abstract  the  spatial  and  temporal  relations  from  the 

1  *A  form  of  sensibility*,  when  used  in  this  second  meaning,  is 
the  source  of  space  and  time,  but  it  ought  not  to  be  equated  with 
space  and  time  themselves.  The  ambiguity  of  this  phrase  obscures 
Kant's  exposition,  if  it  does  not  confuse  his  thought. 

8  In  A  267  =  B  323  the  form  of  intuition  is  explicitly  referred  to 
as  a  subjective  characteristic  (Bescliaffenheit)  of  sensibility. 

8  The  objection  to  this  is  that  in  the  second  edition  (B  160  n.) 
Kant  speaks  as  if  the  form  had  no  unity.  The  unity  of  space  and 
time  comes  from  the  synthetic  activity  of  the  mind.  Compare  A  99- 
100,  B  137-8,  etc. 

4  Kant,  it  should  be  noted,  habitually  equates  'form*  and  'condition*. 


104  SPACE  AND  TIME  [IV  §  6 

objects  which  stand  in  these  relations,  we  have  pure  intuition. 
In  spite  of  occasional  ambiguities  of  language,  Kant  makes 
it  clear  that  we  obtain  our  intuitions  of  space  and  time  by 
abstracting  from  sensible  objects  or  by  the  elimination  of 
sensible  objects.1  Space  and  time  as  forms  of  appearances  are, 
as  it  were,  embedded  in  given  appearances.  In  pure  intuition 
they  are  known  in  isolation,  and  they  also  acquire  a  unity 
which  as  mere  forms  they  lack.2  This  unity  is  impossible 
without  thought — but  we  are  not  concerned  with  thought 
in  the  Aesthetic. 

The  reason  why  Kant  passes  so  easily  from  the  form  of 
intuition  to  pure  intuition  can  now  be  seen.  The  form  of  intuition 
is  or  contains3  the  relations  (or  system  of  relations)  in  which 
appearances  stand.  The  content  of  pure  intuition  is  these  same 
relations,  abstracted  from  sensible  appearances,  and  taken 
together  as  forming  one  individual  whole.  Space  and  time  are 
at  once  the  forms  of  appearances  and  the  content  of  pure 
intuition.  Indeed  a  necessary  and  universal  form,  if  it  is  known 
by  intuition,  must  be  known  by  pure  intuition;  and  a  pure 
intuition,  if  it  is  to  have  any  content,  must  find  its  content  ' 
in  pure  form  and  not  in  sensible  matter.4 

Kant  makes  his  doctrine  more  difficult  by  saying,  not  that 
space  and  time  are  the  contents  of  pure  intuitions,  but  that 
they  are  pure  intuitions.  This  phrase  serves,  like  the  phrase 

1  Note  especially  A  27  =  B  43  and  compare  Prol.  §  10  (IV  283).  In 
A  20- 1  =  B  35  we  get  the  pure  intuition  of  space  by  leaving  out 
of  the  idea  of  a  body  (i)  what  is  implied  by  thought  (substance,  etc.) 
and  (2)  what  belongs  to  sensation  (colour,  etc.).  The  same  method  is 
employed  in  B  5-6,  and  in  A  22  =  B  36  it  is  said  to  be  the  method 
of  Transcendental  Aesthetic  itself.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  second 
argument  in  the  Metaphysical  Exposition  (A  24  =  B  38-9  and 
especially  A  31  ==  B  46).  For  a  very  clear  statement,  see  Streitschrift 
(VIII 240).  a  B  160  n. 

8  In  B  67  the  form  is  said  to  contain  nothing  but  relations.  'Is* 
and  'contains*  are  habitually  used  by  Kant  as  meaning  the  same 
thing. 

4  Compare  Prol.  §  9  (IV  282)  and  §  10  (IV  283).  The  first  passage 
implies  that  pure  intuition  must  contain  nothing  but  the  form  of 
sensibility,  and  the  second  that  pure  intuitions  must  be  the  forms 
of  sensibility. 


IV  §  6]  SENSE  AND  SENSIBILITY  105 

'form  of  sensibility',  to  indicate  that  space  and  time  are  mind- 
dependent.1 

Pure  intuition  is  pure  or  a  priori,  because  it  eliminates  the 
empirical  element  ot  sense,  and  contains  only  the  necessary 
and  universal  relations  in  which  sensible  things  appear.  It 
should,  however,  be  noted  that  space  and  time  are  not  only 
necessary  and  universal  conditions  of  experience.  They  have 
in  themselves,  even  when  abstracted  from  experience,  a  certain 
necessity  and  universality ;  for  in  knowing  them  we  know,  apart 
from  experience,  what  all  their  parts  must  be.  Our  intuition  of 
them  is  pure,  inasmuch  as  it  is  intuition  of  a  whole  whose  parts 
can  be  known  independently  of  experience.  This  second  sense 
is  not  clearly  distinguished  by  Kant  from  the  first  sense.2 

Pure  intuition  is  intuition  (and  not  conception),  because 
it  involves  an  immediate  cognitive  relation  to  an  individual 
object3 — there  is  only  one  space  and  one  time.4 

Pure  intuition  is  said  to  contain  an  a  priori  manifold,  a 
manifold  which  is  not  a  manifold  of  sensa,  but  is  given  because 
of  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.5  This  manifold  is  composed 
only  of  relations  (spatial  and  temporal).6  It  is  at  once  the 
content  of  pure  intuition  and  the  form  of  (empirical)  intuition.7 

1  Nevertheless  in  the  Metaphysical  Expositions,  where  Kant  proves 
that  space  and  time  are  pure  intuitions,  he  is  not  arguing  that  they 
are  dependent  on  the  mind,  but  only  that  they  are  known  by  pure 
intuition. 

2  We  shall  see  later  that  these  two  senses  are  closely  connected 
with  one  another.  See  Chapter  VII  §  4. 

3  Space  and  time  are  objects  only  by  courtesy.  Compare  A  291 

=  B  347- 

4  Perhaps  it  is  also  intuition,  because  its  content  is  the  form  of 
sensible  appearances.  It  is  bound  up  with  our  sensuous  nature  and  is 
not  (like  the  categories)  a  product  of  understanding  alone.  Compare 
Chapter  VI II  §  i. 

5  Compare  A  25  =  B  39,  A  77  =  B  102,  A  77  =  B  103,  A  99-100. 

6  The  word  'manifold*  or  'manifoldness*  is  meant  to  indicate  a 
multiplicity  which  in  itself  has  no  unity.  Yet  when  we  speak  of  'a* 
manifold  or  multiplicity,  the  article  'a'  suggests  that  unity  which  we 
wish  to  deny. 

7  Compare  B  136  n.,  B  137,  B  160  n.  In  the  last  passage  the  form  of 
intuition  is  said  to  give  merely  the  manifold,  while  formal  (or  pure) 
intuition  gives  the  unity  of  the  idea.

Because  space  is  a  pure  intuition,  pure  geometry  is  possible ; 
because  space  is  the  form  of  intuition,  pure  geometry  must 
apply  to  the  sensible  world. 

Every  part  of  space  and  time  (and  therefore  every  geo- 
metrical figure)  is  also  a  pure  intuition.1  It  can  be  known  in 
abstraction  from  given  sensations.2

CHAPTER    V 

SPACE   AND    TIME— THE  METAPHYSICAL 
EXPOSITION 

§  i .  Kant's  Question 

We  are  now  in  a  better  position  to  understand  the  central 
question  of  the  Aesthetic.  Kant  believes  that  space  and  time 
are  the  necessary  condition1  under  which  alone  objects  can 
be  given  -to  our  senses,  and  that  they  are  due  to  the  nature 
of  our  human  sensibility.  This  has  to  be  proved,  and  cannot 
be  assumed.  He  therefore  asks  the  general  question  'What  are 
space  and  time  ?'  2 

The  question  suggests  three  possibilities.  Are  they  .(i)  real 
things  ?3  Or  (2)  are  they  only  (inner)  determinations4  or  (outer) 
relations  of  real  things — that  is,  of  things-in-themselves  ?  Or 
(3)  do  they  belong  only  to  the  form  of  intuition,  do  they  depend 
on  the  subjective  constitution  of  the  human  mind?  The  first 
view  was  held  by  Newton,  the  second  (or  something  like  it) 
by  Leibniz,  and  the  third  by  Kant. 

§  2 .  Metaphysical  and  Transcendental  Expositions 

There  is  a  difference  in  the  order  of  exposition  in  the  two 
editions  of  the  Kritik.  In  the  first  Kant  lumped  all  his  arguments 
together.  In  the  second  he  distinguishes  two  different  methods 
of  argument,  and  separates  the  Metaphysical  from  the  Trans- 
cendental Exposition.  He  fails  to  carry  this  out  consistently. 
In  the  case  of  time  the  transcendental  argument  is  allowed 
to  remain  in  the  middle  of  the  metaphysical  argument;5  and 

1  B  29.  He  changed  this  from  'conditions'  in  A  15,  but  carelessly 
retains   the   plural  in   B  30  =  A  16.    The   change   is  probably  due 
to  Kant's  desire  to  connect  space  and  time  together  as  the  condition 
under  which  all  objects  must  be  given.  See  Chapter  VII  §  i. 

2  A  23  =  B  37.  s  Wesen. 
4  'Determinations'  (Bestimmungeri)  are  here  contrasted  with  rela- 
tions, but  in  other  places  they  cover  relations,  e.g.  in  A  26  »  B  42. 

6  Argument  3. 


io8  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §  a 

transcendental  considerations  are  retained  at  the  end  of  the 
third  metaphysical  argument  for  space,  and  at  the  end  of  the 
fourth  metaphysical  argument  for  time. 

A  metaphysical  exposition  of  an  idea1  analyses  the  idea 
by  itself,  and  by  analysis  shows  it  to  be  given  a  priori?  A  trans- 
cendental exposition  of  an  idea  exhibits  it  as  a  principle  in  the 
light  of  which  the  possibility  of  other  synthetic  a  priori  cogni- 
tions can  be  understood.  It  shows  (i)  that  other  synthetic 
a  priori  knowledge  is  derived  from  the  idea,  and  (2)  that  such 
knowledge  is  possible  only  if  the  idea  is  explained  in  a  particular 
way3  (namely  as  given  a  priori).  In  the  present  case  synthetic 
a  priori  propositions  (especially  those  of  mathematics)  are 
shown  to  be  possible  only  if  space  and  time  are  explained 
to  be  a  priori  intuitions.4 

The  Metaphysical  and  Transcendental  Expositions  of  space 
and  time  are  roughly  parallel5  to  the  Metaphysical  and  Trans- 

1  B  38.  The  word  'Begriff  is  here  (as  frequently)  applied  to  space 
and  time,  but  'Begriff*  strictly  speaking  is  a  concept,  not  an  intuition. 
It  is  better  to  speak  of  space  and  time  as  'ideas',  for  'idea*  (Vorstellung) 
covers  both  intuition  and  concept.  'Vorstellung'  means  what  is  set 
before,  or  presented  to,  the  mind. 

2  I  take  this  to  mean  only  that  the  idea,  as  necessary  and  universal, 
is  not  borrowed  from*,  or  dependent  upon,  experience.  The  positive 
statement  of  its  origin  must  come  later. 

The  use  of  the  word  'metaphysical'  in  this  connexion  may  possibly 
have  suggested  itself  to  Kant  because  he  believed  that  the  chief 
value  of  existing  metaphysics  consisted  in  analysis  of  concepts  with- 
out any  reference  to  the  possibility  of  their  objects.  Compare  A  5-6 
=  B  9-10.  3  B  40. 

4  The  Transcendental  Exposition  of  space  (though  not  of  time) 
goes  further,  and  'explains*  that  space  must  be  in  the  subject  as  a 
form  of  sensibility.   Strictly  speaking,   a  transcendental  exposition 
ought  to  take  into  account  the  origin  of  the  idea,  but  for  the  sake  of 
simplicity  it  is  better  to  reserve  the  question  of  origins  for  the  'con- 
clusions'. In  some  ways  the  introduction  of  this  distinction  in  the 
second  edition  disturbs  the  natural  development  of  Kant's  argument. 
There  is  also  a  certain  awkwardness  in  speaking  as  if  a  part  of  the 
Aesthetic  were  transcendental  in  a  special  sense,  when  the  whole 
argument  of  the  Aesthetic  is  transcendental,  as  is  indeed  shown  by 
its  very  name. 

5  The  parallel  is  a  very  rough  one  indeed,  for  both  the  Metaphysical 
and  Transcendental  Deductions  deal  with  the  origin  of  the  categories, 


V  §  3]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  109 

cendental  Deductions  of  the  categories.  Kant  even  speaks1 
of  a  transcendental  deduction  of  space  and  time,  but  this  would 
appear  to  cover  the  whole  argument  of  the  Aesthetic,  including 
the  'Conclusions'.2 

§  3.  The  Metaphysical  Exposition 

In  the  Metaphysical  Expositions  Kant  fails  to  maintain  the 
precise  parallelism  between  space  and  time  at  which  he  aims. 
There  is  no  obvious  reason  for  the  variations  introduced,  and 
the  parallelism  is  sufficiently  close  for  us  to  consider  the  two 
expositions  together. 

The  Metaphysical  Exposition  falls  into  two  parts.  The  first 
part  is  intended  to  prove  that  space  and  time  are  not  empirical, 
but  a  priori ',  ideas.  The  second  part  is  intended  to  prove  that 
space  and  time  are  intuitions,  not  concepts.  Both  together 
would  then  prove  that  space  and  time  are  a  priori  or  pure 
intuitions. 

Kant's  argument  is  complicated,  and  obscured,  by  the  fact 
that  he  does  not  distinguish  clearly  between  'pure  intuition* 
and  'form  of  intuition',3  nor  between  two  different  senses 
of  'a  priori*  as  applied  to  our  ideas  of  space  and  time.  The 
first  part  is  concerned  primarily  with  space  and  time  as  forms 
of  appearance  (or  forms  of  intuition).  In  it  the  doctrine  that 
space  and  time  are  a  priori  ideas  means  that  they  are  known 
to  be  universal  and  necessary  conditions,  or  forms,  of  all 
possible  appearances.  In  the  second  part,  if  there  is  any  argu- 
ment to  show  that  space  and  time  are  not  only  intuitions,  but 

and  there  are  no  'Conclusions'  distinct  from  the  Deductions.  The 
Metaphysical  Deduction  may,  however,  be  said  to  consider  the 
categories  in  themselves,  and  the  Transcendental  to  consider  them  in 
their  relation  to  other  knowledge.  Even  this  distinction  must  not  be 
pressed  too  far  either  in  regard  to  the  categories  or  in  regard  to  space 
and  time.  Compare  also  Chapter  XI  §  10. 

1  A  87  =  B  119  and  Pro/.  §  12  (IV  285). 

2  Kant's  statement  can  have  no  reference  to  the  distinction  between 
a  Metaphysical  and  a  Transcendental  Exposition,  since  in  the  first 
edition  this  distinction  had  not  yet  been  made. 

8  See,  for  example,  the  fourth  argument  in  regard  to  time. 
A  31-2  =  647. 


no  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §4 

pure  intuitions — and  Kant's  language  might  suggest  that  there 
is — then  'pure'  (or  'a  priori'}  is  used  to  indicate  that  the  parts 
of  space  and  time  are  known  only  as  limitations  of  the  whole 
space  and  time.1  This  means  that  in  knowing  space  and  time 
we  can  know,  without  recourse  to  experience,  what  their  parts 
(spaces  and  times)  must  be. 

There  is  in  the  Metaphysical  Exposition  only  the  argument 
that  space  and  time  are  at  once  pure  intuitions  and  necessary 
forms  of  appearances  (or  forms  of  intuition).  The  view  that 
space  and  time  have  their  origin  in  the  mind,  and  that  conse- 
quently things  appear  to  us  as  different  from  what  they  are 
in  themselves — all  this  belongs  to  the  'Conclusions'  drawn 
later,  not  to  the  Exposition  itself. 

§  4.  Space  and  Time  not  Empirical  but  a  priori  Ideas 

The  first  part  of  the  Metaphysical  Exposition  contains 
two  arguments. 

The  first  argument  is  the  negative  one  that  space  and  time 
are  not  empirical  ideas,  while  the  second  argument  maintains 
positively  that  space  and  tirtie  are  a  priori  ideas. 

The  ideas  of  space  and  time  cannot  be  'derived'2  or  'bor- 
rowed'3 from  experience,  because  the  ideas  of  space  and  time 
are  presupposed  by  experience.4  If  sensa  are  to  be  related 
to  physical  objects  outside  my  body,5  and  even  if  they  are 
to  be  known  as  outside  and  beside,  and  before  and  after,  one 

1  Compare  Chapter  IV  §  6,  where  it  is  pointed  out  that  intuition 
is  pure  in  two  senses.  In  both  senses  the  word  'pure*  (or  'a  priori') 
implies  that  our  knowledge  is  independent  of  experience  and  has  no 
sensible  content.  2  A  23  =  B  38.  l abgezogerf .  8  'erborgt*. 

4  This  does  not  mean  that  our  ideas  of  space  and  time  are  neces- 
sarily explicit.  They  may  be  ' obscure*  (dunkel),  that  is,  not  imme- 
diately present  to  consciousness.  See  Chapter  XIX  §  8. 

5  Kant  refers  to  sensible  objects  (not  merely  to  sensa),  although 
the  nature  of  the  sensible  or  phenomenal  object  has  not  yet  been 
made  clear.  It  should  be  noted  that  although  all  appearances  (even 
those  in  dreams)  are  spatial  and  temporal,  it  is  only  objects  (in  the 
strict  sense)  which  have  a  determinate  position  in  one  common  time 
and  space.  This  distinction  is  not  made  clear  till  later,  and  then  not 
adequately.

another  (as  they  must  be  in  human  experience) — then  clearly 
space  and  time  are  already  presupposed,  whether  we  are  aware 
of  this  or  not.1  To  know2  things  (whether  sensa  or  objects) 
as  outside  and  beside  one  another  is  not  merely  to  know  quali- 
tative differences  in  them  :3  it  is  to  know  them  as  in  different 
places,  that  is,  in  different  parts  of  space.  Similarly  to  know 
things  as  simultaneous  or  as  successive  is  not  merely  to  know 
qualitative  differences  in  them :  it  is  to  know  them  as  occurring 
in  one  and  the  same  time  or  in  different  times,  that  is,  in  one 
part  or  in  different  parts  (or  moments)  of  time. 

Kant's  main  argument  is  that  the  particular  spatial  and 
temporal  relations  in  which  sensa  (and  consequently  objects) 
are  given  cannot  be  reduced  to  mere  qualitative  differences, 
and  that  space  and  time  are  presupposed  as  conditions  of  such 
particular  relations.4  There  may  also  be  a  suggestion  that  the 
ideas  of  space  and  time  are  not  abstracted  from  given  sensa 
(or  objects)  in  the  same  way  as  empirical  concepts  of  a  common 
characteristic  (like  redness  or  colouredness)  are  abstracted.5 
This  subsidiary  contention  is  by  no  means  clear:  it  ought  not 
to  be  interpreted  as  an  assertion  that  we  know  space  and  time 
before  experience  begins. 

So  far  Kant's  position  has  been  stated  negatively — space 

1  Just  as  all  thinking  presupposes  the  law  of  non-contradiction, 
whether  we  are  aware  of  this  or  not. 

2  Unfortunately  English  has   no  word  corresponding  exactly  to 
lvorstellen\  which  may  mean  either  to  intuit  or  to  think  or  to  do 
both  together  and  therefore  to  know.  Hence  unless  we  employ  an 
un-English  word  like  'represent',  we  are  compelled  to  make  more 
definite  what  in  German  is  left  vague. 

8  I  take  ' bloss  verschieden*  in  A  23  =  638  to  refer  to  qualitative 
differences.

5  For  the  different  kinds  of  abstraction,  see  §  9  below.  This  sug- 
gestion touches  upon  the  distinction  between  a  concept  and  a  pure 
intuition  which  is  dealt  with  later.  Our  ideas  of  space  and  time  are 
not  merely  concepts  of  common  qualities,  or  common  relationships, 
of  spatial  and  temporal  obiects. 


ii2  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §4 

and  time  are  not  empirical  ideas.  We  may  state  it  positively 
by  saying  that  space  and  time  (as  conditions  of  the  spatial  and 
temporal  relations  in  which  appearances  must  be  given)  are 
conditions  of  appearances.  We  cannot  know  appearances  apart 
from  space  and  time. 

The  second  argument  goes  further  and  maintains  that  we 
can  know  space  and  time  apart  from  appearances.  The  first 
argument  by  itself  is  not  enough  to  establish  the  logical  pri- 
ority of  space  and  time;  for  space  and  time  might  stand  to 
appearances  in  a  symmetrical  relation,  and  appearances  might 
be  the  condition  of  space  and  time  just  as  much  as  space  and 
time  are  the  conditions  of  appearances.1 

Space  and  time  are  necessary  and  a  priori  ideas.  The  reason 
for  this  is  that  we  can  think  away  objects  of  experience  from 
space  and  time,  and  still  have  space  and  time  left ;  but  if  we  try 
to  think  away  space  and  time  from  objects  of  experience,  we 
have  nothing  left.2  It  follows  that  space  and  time^  are  not 
'determinations'3  logically  dependent  upon  appearances;  they 
are  the  conditions  of  the  possibility  of  appearances  and  are 
logically  prior  to  them. 

This  argument  has  been  much  criticised  in  modern  times, 
but  Kant  is  trying  to  state  something  which  is  true.4 

If  we  attempt  to  think  of  any  object — whether  we  take 
as  our  example  a  colour,  or  an  object  proper  such  as  a  tree — 
if  we  try  to  think  of  it  as  having  no  spatial  or  temporal  character- 
istics, it  becomes  nothing  at  all.5  It  is  more  difficult  to  be  sure 

1  For  example  in  space-time  space  is  the  condition  of  time  and 
time  the  condition  of  space,  so  that  neither  is  prior  to  the  other 
(Kant  himself  in  such  a  case  would  probably  speak  of  either  as  prior 
to  the  other).  We  shall  see  later  that  matter  (or  sensation)  is  as  neces- 
sary to  experience  as  form,  but  that  this  fact  does  not  annul  the 
distinction  between  form  and  matter  or  between  the  a  priori  and 
the  empirical.  See  Chapter  VII  §  4. 

2  Kant  states  this  argument  more  clearly  for  time  than  for  space. 
8  'Bestimmungen.'  This  word  covers  both  internal  qualities  and 

external  relations.  I  have  sometimes  translated  it  as  Characteristics'.

V  §4]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  113 

that  we  can  have  an  idea  of  a  space  or  time  in  which  there  are 
no  objects.  Yet  even  here,  although  a  tree,  if  it  is  to  be  a  tree, 
must  occupy  space  and  last  through  time,  we  could  have  space 
and  time,  and  even  this  space  and  time,  if  this  tree  (or  all  trees) 
had  never  existed.  That  is  to  say  we  can  be  aware  of  space  and 
time  apart  from  any  individual  object,  though  we  cannot 
be  aware  of  any  individual  object  apart  from  space  and  time. 

Does  Kant  mean  we  can  be  aware  of  space  and  time  apart 
from  all  objects  of  experience?  Certainly  we  cannot  perceive1 
empty  time  or  empty  space;  he  insists  on  this  over  and  over 
again  in  the  Analogies  in  regard  to  time,2  and  the  same  doctrine 
is  set  forth  about  space  in  the  Metaphysische  Anfangsgriinde 
der  Naturwissenschaft.  To  perceive  time  and  space,  we  must 
perceive  things  in  time  and  space,  and  we  get  the  ideas  of 
absolute  or  empty  time  and  space  only  by  eliminating  or 
thinking  away  objects  in  time  and  space.3 

Newton  presumably  believed  that  we  could  be  aware  in 
some  sense  of  absolute  space  and  time,  and  even  that  absolute 
space  and  time  could  be  real  things,  apart  from  what  is  in  them. 
This  is  not  Kant's  doctrine.  What  he  holds  is  that  in  geometry 
we  can  study  space  as  an  individual  thing  in  abstraction  from 
the  empirical  objects  in  it,  and  that  something  similar  is  possible 
also  in  the  case  of  time.  We  do  so  by  constructing  geometrical 
figures  a  priori  in  pure  intuition,4  although  these  involve,  and 
are  even  said  to  be,  appearances  present  to  the  senses.5  We  can 
also  be  aware  of  space  and  time  as  unique  wholes,  and  say 
that  space  has  three  dimensions,  while  time  has  one;6  but  even 
such  fundamental  principles  would  have  no  meaning  (that  is,

no  objective  reference),  unless  we  could  exhibit  their  meaning 
in  relation  to  empirical  objects  -,1  and  our  idea  of  space  or  time 
would  be  a  mere  'schema'  apart  from  the  activity  of  repro- 
ductive imagination  in  calling  up  objects  of  experience.2 
However  much  we  can  think  of  space  or  time  as  empty  of  any 
particular  objects,  there  must  be  some  sort  of  reference  at  least 
to  possible  objects;  and  we  can  know  particular  spaces  and 
times  only  by  knowing  the  objects  which  they  contain. 

In  speaking  of  space  and  time  as  individual  wholes  we  are 
passing  to  the  second  part  of  Kant's  exposition,  which  is  con- 
cerned with  space  and  time  as  pure  intuitions  rather  than  as 
forms  of  appearances.  But  so  far  we  can  affirm  Kant  to  be  right 
in  saying  that  space  and  time  have  a  unique  status  in  experi- 
ence; and  this  status  is  described  not  improperly  in  the  assertion 
that  space  and  time  are  the  necessary  and  universal  conditions 
of  the  possibility  of  experience.  Apart  from  them  the  given 
manifold  of  appearance  could  not  be  arranged  in  those  relations 
of  outside  and  beside,  and  before  and  after,  in  which  it  always 
is  arranged — and  indeed  must  be  arranged,  if  we  are  to  have 
human  experience  at  all.  Space  and  time  are  thus  the  a  priori 
forms  of  all  appearances.3 

§  5.  Space  and  Time  not  Concepts  but  Intuitions 

The  third  and  fourth  arguments  (in  the  case  of  time  the 
fourth  and  fifth  arguments)4  are  directed  to  show  that  space 
and  time  are  not  concepts  but  intuitions. 

1  A  240  =  B29Q.  2  A  156  =  B  195. 

8  It  should  be  noted  that  Kant  himself  might  have  regarded  the 
first  two  arguments,  and  especially  the  second — compare  ProL  §  10 
(IV  283) — as  proving  not  that  space  and  time  are  forms  of  appear- 
ances, but  that  they  are  pure  intuitions.  In  that  case,  however,  we 
must  take  pure  intuition  to  mean  primarily  an  intuition  whose  content 
is  the  form  (or  formal  relations)  in  which  all  appearances  are,  and  must 
be,  given.  In  the  later  arguments  pure  intuition  is  considered  in 
abstraction  from  appearances. 

4  Where  we  deal  with  space  and  time  together,  it  is  simpler  to 
suppose  that  the  third  argument  on  time  has  been  removed  to  the 
Transcendental  Exposition,  and  the  fourth  and  fifth  arguments 
renumbered. 


V  §6]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  115 

A  concept,1  as  we  saw  above,2  is  a  general  idea  containing  the 
common  marks  of  different  individual  objects.  An  intuition 
is  a  singular  or  individual  idea,  that  is,  an  idea  of  an  individual 
object.  I  conceive  triangularity,  but  I  intuit  this  triangle. 

The  reasons  why  space  and  time  are  intuitions3  and  not 
concepts  are  (the  third  argument)  that  space  and  time  are  one, 
and  (the  fourth  argument)  that  space  and  time  are  infinite. 

These  two  arguments  are  not  sharply  distinguished.  Argu- 
ments used  in  connexion  with  the  oneness  of  space  are  used 
also  in  connexion  with  the  infinity  of  time. 

§  6.  Oneness  of  Space  and  Time 

The  first  argument  is  simple.  Different  spaces  are  all  parts 
of  one  space,  and  different  times  are  all  parts  of  one  time. 
Space  and  time  are  therefore  one  and  individual,  and  as  such 
must  be  known  primarily  by  intuition  and  not  by  conception.4 

In  regard  to  space  there  is  added  a  further  argument,  which 
must  apply  equally  to  time.5 

We  have  spoken  of  different  spaces  as  parts  of  one  all- 
embracing  space.  It  must  not  be  thought  that  we  know  these 

1  Log.  §  i  (IX  91).  Kant  objects  to  the  phrase  'general  concepts' 
(or  'common  concepts*),  because  this  applies  to  all  concepts.  Never- 
theless he  himself  has  to  speak  of  a  general  or  universal  concept 
(spatiality)  in  connexion  with  space,  because  he  sometimes  uses  the 
word  Concept*  (Begriff)  for  the  intuition  of  space. 

2  In  Chapter  IV  §  2. 

3  For  the  meaning  of  this,  see  Chapter  IV  §  2.  It  might  be  better 
to  say  that  our  'ideas'  of  space  and  time  are  intuitions  not  concepts. 
Kant  does  say  that  the  'idea  of  space'  is  an  intuition  (B  40),  but  he 
also  speaks  of  the  'idea  time*  (A  32  —  B  48). 

4  Kant,  as  usual,  speaks  of  space,  not  as  known  by  intuition,  but 
as  itself  pure  intuition  (A  24-5  =  B  39).  In  the  case  of  time  he  says 
that  the  idea  which  can  be  given  only  through  a  single  object  is 
intuition  (A  32  —  B  47).  Time  itself  he  describes  as  a  pure  form  of 
sensible  intuition. 

6  The  beginning  of  this  further  argument  may  be  regarded  as 
merely  expanding  and  explaining  what  is  already  said;  but  it  may 
be  taken  to  state  a  new  point — that  space  is  not  only  an  individual 
whole  of  parts  (which  must  be  known  by  intuition),  but  also  an 
individual  whole  which  is  logically  prior  to  its  parts  (and  therefore 
known  by  pure  intuition). 


ii6  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §6 

different  spaces,  so  to  speak,  in  themselves,  and  that  the  all- 
embracing  space  is  a  mere  aggregate  of  such  different  spaces. 
On  the  contrary,  these  different  spaces  must  be  thought  of 
as  in  the  one  all-embracing  space.  They  are  known  only  as 
limitations  of  the  one  all-embracing  space,  which  must  be 
presupposed  from  the  beginning.1 

It  is  not  so  clear  why  this  contention  should  lead  to  the 
conclusion  that  space  is  known  primarily  by  intuition.  This 
indeed  follows  from  the  fact  that  space  is  'essentially  one',2 
a  whole  which  is  logically  prior  to  its  parts ;  but  there  is  a  further 
point  to  be  made.  Kant  is  not  denying  that  we  have  a  concept 
of  spatiality,  a  concept  of  the  characteristics  or  'marks'  common 
to  all  different  spaces,  or,  as  he  calls  it,  'a  universal  concept 
of  spaces  in  general'.3  His  argument  seems  to  be  (i)  that  one 
common  mark  of  the  many  different  spaces  is  that  they  are 
necessarily  limited;  and  (2)  that  consequently  our  concept 
of  spatiality  is  derived  from  our  immediate  intuition  of  spaces 
as  necessarily  limited.4  The  intuition  of  spaces  as  necessarily 
limited  presupposes  a  pure  intuition  of  one  all-embracing 
space.  Hence  our  concept  of  spatiality  presupposes  a  pure 
intuition  of  one  all-embracing  space.  In  other  words,  one  pure 
intuition  of  space  must  underlie  all  our  concepts  of  spatiality.5 

1  I  do  not  think  that  Kant  means  that  we  first  know  the  all-embrac- 
ing space,  and  then  know  the  many  spaces.  I  think  he  means  that 
any  given  space  is  known  as  a  part  of  a  wider  space,  and  that  if  we 
think  this  out,  we  shall  find  that  every  given  space  implies  an  all- 
embracing  space  of  which  it  is  a  limitation.  The  all-embracing  space 
is  logically  prior  to  the  many  spaces. 

2  'wesentlich  einig.9  8  A  25  =  B  39. 
4  'The  manifold  in  space,  and  therefore  the  universal  concept  of 

spaces  in  general,  rests  only  upon  limitations.*  The  'manifold*  here 
is  the  pure  manifold. 

6  The  fact  that  Kant  uses  'space5  both  for  individual  space  and 
for  spatiality  makes  him  difficult  to  follow.  What  I  describe  as  con- 
cepts of  spatiality  are  called  in  A  'concepts  of  spaces'  (denselberi), 
and  in  B  'concepts  of  space9  (demselberi).  It  is  difficult  to  see  why 
'concepts'  is  used  in  the  plural — perhaps  because  space  has  many 
common  marks.  It  is  also  difficult  to  see  the  reason  for  the  change 
made  in  B,  since  the  concept  is  said  immediately  above  to  be  a  con- 
cept of  spaces  in  general  (as  indeed  must  be  the  case  if  it  rests  on 


V  §6]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  117 

This  second  argument  may  be  intended  to  show,  not  only 
that  our  knowledge  of  space  is  intuitive,  but  also  that  it  is 
a  priori.1  If  so,  our  knowledge  is  here  shown  to  be  a  priori,  not 
in  the  sense  of  being  knowledge  of  the  necessary  conditions 
of  appearances,  but  in  the  sense  of  being  knowledge  of  a  whole 
whose  parts  are  known  independently  of  experience.2 

In  this  respect  space  as  one  whole  of  parts  is  on  a  different 
footing  from  such  a  whole  as  the  totality  of  colours.3  The 
totality  of  colours  is  also  an  individual  whole,  but  it  is  so  only 
as  a  collection  or  aggregate  of  individual  appearances  with 
a  common  observed  characteristic  (colouredness) ;  and  it  can 
be  known  only  by  completing  the  series  of  empirical  intuitions 
of  these  appearances.  Space  is  a  different  kind  of  individual 
whole,  such  that  knowing  it  we  can  say  what  its  parts  must 
be.  Hence  it  is  known  by  pure  intuition,  not  by  a  series  of 
empirical  intuitions.4 


limitations).  Perhaps  the  change  was  made  through  the  proximity 
of  the  phrase  'in  Ansehung  seiner*  ('in  regard  to  space*). 

Vaihinger  (Commentar,  ii,  p.  223)  takes  Kant's  argument  to  be  that 
only  in  the  case  of  intuition  does  the  whole  precede  the  parts;  in 
the  case  of  the  concept  the  parts  always  precede  the  whole.  But 
Kant  does  not  here  make  this  view  of  the  concept  explicit.  The 
word  '  Bestandteile*  is  indeed  used  for  the  *  parts'  of  a  concept  in  Log. 
Einl.  V  (IX  35),  but  it  is  not  the  usual  technical  term. 

1  It  is  possible  that  the  third  and  fourth  arguments  of  the  Meta- 
physical Exposition  are  intended  only  to  prove  that  space  and  time 
are  intuitions.  Kant  certainly  asserts  as  his  conclusion  that  they  are 
pure  or  a  priori  intuitions,  but  he  may  consider  himself  entitled  to 
do  so  on  the  ground  that  he  has  already  proved  them  to  be  pure  or 
a  priori.  Nevertheless  the  second  sense  of  'a  priori*  is  so  clearly 
implied  in  his  arguments,  and  so  important  for  his  whole  doctrine, 
that  I  prefer  to  make  it  explicit. 

2  They  are  known  to  be  necessarily  limited  or  finite. 

8  By  the  totality  of  colours  I  mean,  not  the  colour  scale,  but  all 
the  individual  colours  in  the  world. 

4  We  cannot  even  construct  the  colour  scale  a  priori  though  per- 
haps we  might  fill  small  gaps  in  it  (compare  Hume,  Treatise,  Book  I, 
Part  I,  Section  i);  still  less  can  we  construct  the  totality  of  colours. 

The  fact  that  synthesis  is  necessary  in  order  to  know  space  must 
be  examined  later. 


u8  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §7 

§  7.  Infinity  of  Space  and  Time 

We  have  now  to  consider  the  arguments  from  the  infinity 
of  space  and  time. 

It  is  easy  to  see  that  the  argument  for  the  oneness  of  space 
is  also  an  argument  for  its  infinity,  and  it  is  so  used  in  regard 
to  time. 

The  infinity  of  time  is  said  to  mean  no  more  than  this — 
that  any  determinate  quantity  (or  part)  of  time  is  possible  only 
as  a  limitation  of  the  one  all-inclusive  time,  which  is  pre- 
supposed.1 As  this  is  true  of  all  quantities  or  parts  of  time,  the 
original2  idea  of  time3  must  be  given  as  unlimited,  or  as  infinite 
in  the  sense  indicated.  That  is  to  say,  our  idea  of  an  all-inclusive 
time  is  logically  prior  to  our  intuitions  of  different  times. 

The  next  step  is  intended  to  show  that  such  an  idea  must 
be  an  intuition,  not  a  concept.  This  would  follow  merely  from 
the  fact  that  time  is  one  and  individual,  but  Kant  makes  it 
follow  here  from  the  fact  that  time  is  infinite  in  the  precise 
sense  indicated. 

The  reason  why  it  thus  follows  is  stated  differently  in  the 
two  editions.  In  the  first  edition  the  idea  of  an  all-inclusive 
time4  cannot  be  given  through  concepts,5  because  the  parts 
of  a  concept  are  logically  prior  to  the  concept  itself.  This  is 

1  I  take  the  phrase  'zum  Grunde  liegende*  to  mean  that  the  all- 
inclusive  time  is  presupposed  as  a  condition. 

2  A  32  =  B  48.  'Original'  (ursprilnglich)  is  opposed  to  'derivative* 
(abgeleitet).  In  B  72  'original'  and  'derivative*  are  used  in  a  special 
sense :  the  ideas  of  space  and  time  are  said  to  be  'derivative'  and  not 
'original',  that  is,  they  are  due  to  a  dependent  sensibility  and  not  to 
a  self-sufficient  intellectual  intuition.  Compare  Metaphysik  d.  Sitten, 
Rechtslehre,  §  10  (VI  258)  and  Streitschrift,  i.  Abschnitt  (VIII  222-3) 
for  further  light  on  these  terms. 

3  Note  that  Kant  himself  says  'the  idea  time',  not  the  'idea  of  time*. 
As  usual  Kant's  transition  from  time  itself  to  the  idea  makes  the 
argument  difficult  to  follow.  Our  original  idea  of  time  is  an  idea  of 
something  infinite  or  unlimited,  and  this  idea  is  presupposed  by  our 
intuitions  of  finite  times. 

4  Kant  says  'the  whole  idea*. 

6  Here  again  it  is  difficult  to  see  why  Kant  refers  to  'concepts'  in 
the  plural,  unless  it  is  because  the  concept  of  temporality  contains 
different  'marks*. 


V  §7]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  119 

withdrawn  in  the  second  edition,  perhaps  because  the  statement 
is  not  true  of  concepts  of  reason  or  Ideas.1  The  reason  why  the 
idea  of  an  all-inclusive  time  cannot  be  given  through  concepts 
is  (in  the  second  edition)  because  concepts  contain  only  'partial 
representations** 

Kant's  argument  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  he  assumes 
both  time  and  parts  of  time  to  be  our  ideas.3  Our  idea  of  the 
one  all-inclusive  time  is,  so  to  speak,  an  idea  of  all  the  times 
that  there  are — it  contains  all  times  as  parts  of  itself:  hence 
all  finite  individual  times  are  parts  of  our  idea  of  one  all- 
inclusive  time.  If  our  idea  were  a  concept,  its  parts  could  not 
be  individual  times  (or  lengths  of  time);  for  the  parts  of  a 
concept  are  not  the  individual  instances  which  fall  under  the 
concept,  but  simply  the  common  characteristics,  or  common 
'marks',4  which  are  found  in  the  individual  instances.  Our  idea 
of  time  must  be  an  intuition,  since  its  parts  are  individual 
times ;  and  indeed  it  must  be  a  pure  intuition,  for  only  so  can 
it  be  the  idea  of  an  all-inclusive  time  whose  parts  (individual 
times)  are  known  only  as  limitations  of  the  whole. 

This  intuition  of  an  all-inclusive  time  is  not  only  prior 
to  our  intuitions  of  different  times:  it  is  also  prior  to  our 
concepts  of  temporality,  our  concepts  of  the  characteristics 
or  marks  common  to  different  times.  As  Kant  says,  it  'underlies* 
our  concepts.5  The  reason  for  this  is  presumably  that  already 
stated  in  connexion  with  the  oneness  of  space.  One  common 
mark  of  different  times  is  that  they  are  necessarily  limitations 

1  See  Log.  §3(1X92). 

2  *  Teilvorstellungen.'  These  seem  to  be  identical  with  the  'Teil- 
begriffe*  and  ' Partialvorstellungen'  of  the  lectures  on  Logic,  and  for 
the   present   purpose   may   be   equated   (as   in  A  43  =  B  60)   with 
'Merkmale',  that  is,  with  'marks'  (notae).  See  Log.  EinL  VIII  and 
§§  i  and  7  (IX  58,  91,  and  95).  Compare  also  Chapter  IX  §  4. 

8  At  present  this  should  not  mean  that  they  are  only  ideas. 

4  The  common  characteristics  or  marks  contained  in  the  concept 
of  temporality  are,  for  example,  continuity,  homogeneity,  unity  of 
dimension,  and  perhaps  limitation. 

6  B  48.  In  the  first  edition  he  seems  to  say  that  it  underlies  'our 
whole  idea',  whereas  it  really  is  our  whole  idea.  The  change  from 
'ihre*  to  'ihnen*  in  B  gives  better  sense. 


izo  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §  7 

of  the  one  time,  and  our  concept  of  temporality  must  be 
derived  from  our  intuitions  of  times  as  necessarily  limited. 
The  intuition  of  times  as  necessarily  limited  presupposes 
a  pure  intuition  of  one  all-inclusive  time,  and  therefore  this 
one  pure  intuition  must  underlie  all  our  concepts  of  temporality. 

The  arguments  from  the  infinity  of  space  are  somewhat 
different,  and  are  stated  with  greater  clarity. 

In  the  first  edition  Kant  argued  that  a  concept  of  spatiality, 
inasmuch  as  it  is  a  concept  of  what  is  common  to  spaces  of 
different  sizes,  cannot  determine  anything  about  quantity. 
The  inference  would  appear  to  be  that  since  infinity  is  a  quan- 
tity, our  knowledge  of  the  infinity  of  space  must  be  derived, 
not  from  the  concept  of  spatiality,  but  from  the  intuition 
of  space.1 

In  the  second  edition  Kant  recognises  that  a  concept  can 
involve  infinity,  in  the  sense  that  it  can  be  present  in  an  infinite 
number  of  possible  instances2  as  a  common  characteristic. 
That  is  to  say,  a  concept  can  have  an  infinite  number  of  in- 
stances under  it,  but  it  cannot  have  an  infinite  number  of 
instances3  in  it,  as  space  has  an  infinite  number  of  spaces  in  it. 
The  general  concept  is  spatiality,  and  although  spatiality  has 
an  infinite  number  of  instances  (spaces)  which  fall  under  it, 
to  speak  of  these  spaces4  as  in  it  would  be  ridiculous.  We  must 
not  confuse  our  intuition  of  infinite  space  with  the  concept 
of  spatiality. 

1  Note,  however,  that  it  is  only  because  of  the  absence  of  limits 
in  the  progress  of  our  intuition  that  we  obtain  the  principle  of  infinity. 

*  Kant  says  'ideas',  and  this  might  suggest  a  reference  to  the 
'partial  representations'  of  A  32  =  B  48.  I  doubt  whether  a  concept 
can  be  said  to  be  'in'  the  'partial  representations*  of  which  it  is  com- 
posed, whereas  it  is  said  to  be  contained  'in*  the  idea  of  the  things 
which  are  known  through  it.  See  Log.  §  7  (IX  95). 

8  Here  again  I  do  not  think  Kant  can  refer  to  the  'partial  represen- 
tations' or  'marks'  which  are  in  a  concept  as  its  parts.  It  may  be  true 
that  we  cannot  think  an  infinity  of  parts  in  a  concept,  but  that  is 
not  the  point.  I  am  not  even  sure  that  it  is  true.  If  the  'marks'  thought 
in  an  empirical  concept  are  not  infinite,  at  any  rate  we  can  always 
discover  more  of  them  in  experience.  See  Log.  §  103  (IX  141). 

4  Or  of  spatial  things. 


V  §7]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  121 

It  seems  obvious  enough  that  our  idea  of  the  one  infinite 
space  (or  time)  is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  concept  of 
spatiality  (or  temporality),  the  concept  of  what  is  common 
to  all  spaces  (or  times) ;  and  if  an  idea  of  an  individual  is  an 
intuition,  while  an  idea  of  a  common  character  is  a  concept, 
then  our  ideas  of  space  and  time  must  be  intuitions.  If  this  were 
the  whole  of  Kant's  contention,  there  would  be  no  need  to  say 
more:  but  he  is  also  arguing  that  the  intuition  of  an  all-inclusive 
space  (or  time)  (i)  is  logically  prior  to  intuitions  of  limited 
individual  spaces  (or  times) ;  and  (2)  is  for  this  reason  logically 
prior  to  Concepts  of  spatiality  (or  temporality),  which  are 
derived  by  abstraction  from  such  intuitions. 

If  we  insist  that  our  intuitions  of  space  and  time  are  para- 
doxical intuitions,  and  their  objects  paradoxical  objects,  Kant 
is  willing  to  agree.1  It  cannot,  however,  be  denied  that  we  are 
in  some  sense  aware  of  space  and  time  as  individual  wholes, 
and  there  are  at  least  plausible  grounds  for  saying  that  we  are 
aware  of  them  as  infinite  wholes.  To  say  this  is,  on  Kant's 
view,  to  say  that  they  are  objects  of  intuition,  and  indeed 
objects  of  pure  intuition,2  since  we  know  what  all  their  parts 
must  be. 

Kant  may  have  felt  that  there  was  more  difficulty  in  regarding 
time  as  a  pure  intuition  than  in  regarding  space  as  such.  In- 
tuition is  naturally  thought  of  as  an  apprehension  of  the  simul- 
taneous, and  the  parts  of  space  are  simultaneous,3  while  the 
parts  of  time  are  not.4  However  that  may  be,  he  endeavours 
later  to  strengthen  his  argument  that  the  idea  of  time  is  an 
intuition.  He  does  so  by  maintaining  that  all  temporal  relations 
can  be  expressed  in  outer  intuition,  namely  the  intuition  of 
an  infinite  line,  provided  we  remember  that  the  parts  of  an 
infinite  line  are  simultaneous,  while  the  parts  of  time  are 
successive.5  Such  an  argument  would  seem  to  belong  properly 
to  the  Metaphysical  Exposition  of  Time.

space  and  time  are  said  to  be  empty  intuitions  without  an  object. 

2  Or  in  Kant's  language  that  they  are  pure  intuitions.

122  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §  8 

In  the  second  edition  Kant  puts  this  contention  even  more 
strongly,  and  holds  that  all  temporal  relations  must  be  expressed 
in  outer  intuitions.1 

§  8.  Intuition  and  Conception 

That  both  intuition  and  conception  are  necessary  for  know- 
ledge of  any  object  is  an  essential  doctrine  of  the  Critical 
Philosophy.  Kant  has,  however,  said  that  our  ideas  of  space 
and  time  are  intuitions.  Is  not  this  a  flat  contradiction? 

We  must  remember  that  in  the  Aesthetic  Kant  is  'isolating' 
sensibility,  but  even  so  it  should  be  abundantly  clear  that 
he  is  not  denying  the  presence  of  concepts  in  our  knowledge 
of  space  and  time.  He  is  only  asserting  that  our  concepts  of 
spatiality  and  temporality  are  logically  derivative,  and  that  our 
pure  intuitions  of  space  and  time  are  'original'.  As  he  himself 
says,  space  is  'intuitus,  quern  sequitur  conceptus'.2 

This  doctrine  has  been  sufficiently  explained,  but  its  full 
bearings  are  seen  only  when  we  understand  how,  according 
to  Kant,  the  part  played  by  intuition  and  conception  varies 
in  different  kinds  of  cognition.3  In  knowing  a  colour,  the 
intuition  is  primary,  the  concept  derivative;  and  this  is  true 
of  all  empirical  concepts.  In  knowing  a  substance,  although 
intuition  is  always  necessary,  it  plays  a  secondary  part:  the 
concept  of  substance  is  primary  and  is  independent  of  intuition. 
The  same  holds  good  of  all  the  categories  or  pure  concepts 
of  the  understanding. 

Now  the  concept  of  spatiality  must  be  a  pure  concept, 
because  it  is  a  concept  of  what  is  common  to  different  pure 
intuitions.  The  unwary  may  suppose  that  it  is  therefore  on  the 
same  level,  and  of  the  same  nature,  as  a  category.  This  is  a 
mistake.4  The  concept  of  spatiality  resembles  empirical  concepts 
in  being  derivative  and  dependent,  although  unlike  them 

1  See  B  154,  6292. 

2  See  passage  quoted  by  Vaihinger,  Commentary  ii,  p.  233. 

3  This  can  be  fully  understood  only  when  we  have  grasped  the 
distinction  between  different  kinds  of  concepts.  See  Chapter  IX  §  5. 

*  Compare  Pro/.  §  8  (IV  282). 


V  §  8]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  123 

it  is  dependent  on  pure  intuition.  Our  knowledge  of  space 
is  primarily  intuitive,  and  not  intellectual.  Whatever  we  may 
think  of  Kant's  doctrine  about  the  categories,  as  regards  space 
and  time  he  is  surely  right. 

Furthermore,  until  Kant  has  explained  his  doctrine  of 
synthesis,  he  has  to  speak  as  if  the  unity  of  space  were  given 
in  intuition.  It  can,  however,  be  given  only  because  of  a  syn- 
thesis which  does  not  belong  to  sense.1  The  necessary  synthetic 
unity  of  space  (and  of  time)  depends  upon,  and  presupposes, 
the  pure  categories  of  the  understanding.2  All  this  is  omitted 
from  the  Aesthetic,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  such  an  omission 
is  defensible.  A  man  cannot  explain  his  whole  philosophy 
at  once. 

It  is  much  more  difficult  to  defend  the  statement  that  space 
is  'represented'  as  an  infinite  given  quantity.3  No  doubt  here 
also  the  fact  of  synthesis  has  to  be  ignored,  though  it  is  hinted 
at;  for  Kant  speaks  of  the  absence  of  limits  in  the  advance 
of  intuition  as  the  source  of  our  knowledge  that  space  is  infinite.4 
Moreover  the  word  'represented'5  may  cover  either  intuition  or 
thought  or  both  together,  and  a  little  later6  Kant  says  expressly 
that  space  is  thought  as  containing  an  infinity  of  parts  in  it. 
In  the  case  of  time  the  meaning  ascribed  to  'infinity'7  avoids 
the  suggestion  that  the  infinite  whole  is  given  as  complete:8 
the  'infinity*  of  time  means  that  any  determinate  quantity 
of  time  is  possible  only  as  a  limitation  of  the  whole,  and  on 
this  statement  the  argument  turns.9  I  think  also  we  are  entitled 
to  lay  stress  on  Kant's  insistence  that  our  pure  intuition  of 
space  (or  time)  underlies™  both  our  concepts  of  spatiality  (or

8  Nevertheless  the  original  idea  of  time  is  said  to  be  given  as 
unlimited. 

9  Compare  also  Kant's  own  defence  of  his  statement  about  space 
quoted  by  Vaihinger  (Commentar,  ii,  p.  255).  There  he  seems  to 
reduce  the  infinity  of  space  to  the  fact  that  all  spaces  are  possible 
and  thinkable  only  as  parts  of  the  one  space.  He  even  suggests  that 
what  is  given  is  the  possibility  of  all  spaces,  which  goes  ad  infinitum. 

10  'zum  Grunde  liegt.' 


124  SPACE  AND  TIME  [V  §  9 

temporality)  and  our  empirical  intuitions  of  spatial  (or  temporal) 
appearances.  Infinite  space  and  time  are  given  to  us,  not 
as  completed  wholes,  but  as  necessarily  presupposed  in  our 
experience. 

This  I  take  to  be  the  true  doctrine  which  Kant  is  attempting 
to  state.  Nevertheless  we  cannot  acquit  him  of  carelessness 
in  expression,  and  perhaps  not  even  of  confusion  in  thought. 
We  must  say,  not  only  that  infinite  space  and  time  are  not  given 
to  us  apart  from  the  synthesis  of  the  understanding,  but  that 
as  completed  wholes  they  are  not  given  to  us  at  all.1  Kant 
himself  speaks  of  absolute  space  elsewhere  as  a  concept  of 
reason,  a  mere  Idea.2 

Kant's  statement,  at  the  best,  must  be  taken  as  provisional 
and  liable  to  subsequent  correction.  At  present  we  can  maintain 
only  that  our  knowledge  of  space  and  time  as  infinite  depends 
primarily  on  our  pure  intuitions,  the  synthesis  of  which  from 
their  very  nature  can  never  be  completed.  For  the  purposes  of 
the  argument  this  is  enough. 

§  9.  Different  kinds  of  Abstraction 

I  have  said  that  we  have  pure  intuition  when  we  abstract 
the  spatial  and  temporal  relations  from  the  objects  which  stand 
in  these  relations.3  This  seems  to  me  the  natural  way  of  speaking, 
but  it  will  be  noticed  that  Kant  himself  says  only  that  we  have 
pure  intuition  when  we  abstract  from  the  objects.4  And  this 
raises  a  point  which  must  be  made  clear. 

1  In  K.d.U.  §  26  (V  254)  Kant  says  it  is  the  voice  of  reason  which 
makes  it  inevitable  that  infinite  space  and  time  should  be  thought 
as  wholly  given  (in  the  judgement  of  common  reason).   Does  this 
imply  that  the  statement  in  the  Aesthetic  is  of  a  popular  or  pro- 
visional character?  In  any  case  it  suggests  that  the  word  Represented* 
should  be  taken  as  meaning  'thought*.  We  do  think  of  space  and 
time  as  infinite  given  quantities,  though  our  pure  intuition  can  never 
be  a  completed  whole. 

2  M.A.d.N.  (IV  559).  Compare  also  op.  cit.  (IV  481).  I  am  here 
presuming  that  the  absolute  space  of  the  Newtonian  physicist  and 
the  infinite  space  of  the  mathematician  are  to  be  identified.  In  his 
casual  jottings  (which  cannot  have  the  authority  of  a  published 
work)  Kant  denies  space  to  be  a  concept  of  reason.   See  Nachlass 
4188  (XVII  450).  3  See  §  3  above.  *  A  27  =  B  43. 


V  §  Q]  THE  METAPHYSICAL  EXPOSITION  125 

It  is  one  of  Kant's  logical  doctrines  that  we  should  never 
speak  of  'abstracting  something*  but  that  we  should  speak  only 
of  'abstracting  from  something'.1  Thus  when  we  think  of  the 
red  colour  of  a  piece  of  cloth,  he  is  prepared  to  say  that  we 
abstract  from  the  cloth,  but  not  that  we  abstract  the  red  colour 
from  the  cloth. 

I  do  not  think  this  point  is  of  great  importance  for  our 
present  purposes.  What  is  of  importance  is  that  space  and  time 
are  not  abstracted  from  objects  in  the  same  way  as  red  colour 
is  abstracted.2 

Kant  is  .prepared  to  say  that  red  colour  is  given  in  roses  and 
cinnabar,  and  is  logically  extracted,  if  not  abstracted,  from 
them.3  By  this  I  take  him  to  mean  that  by  abstraction  we 
ignore  the  differences  in  the  given  objects,  and  consider  redness 
in  separation  as  their  common  'mark'.4  An  idea  thus  abstracted 
from  experience — to  use  the  common  idiom — is  a  concept  and 
is  not  independent  of  experience. 

If  space  and  time  were  abstracted  in  this  way,  we  should 
have  merely  the  concepts  of  spatiality  and  temporality,  and 
should  have  no  ground  for  regarding  them  as  independent 
of  experience.  For  this  reason  Kant  sometimes  denies  our 
ideas  of  space  and  time  to  be  the  results  of  abstraction.5  This, 
I  take  it,  is  the  false  doctrine  of  Leibniz  which  he  repudiates. 
The  whole  point  of  Kant's  doctrine  is  that  our  ideas  of  space 
and  time  are  not  concepts  of  the  features  or  relations  common 
to  different  sensible  objects,  such  as  their  'outsideness*  or 
'successiveness'.  A  thing  can  be  outside  another  only  if  both 
things  are  in  space.  It  can  be  after  another  only  if  both  things 
are  in  time.  In  knowing  space  and  time  we  are  not  abstracting, 
or  extracting,  the  common  relational  qualities6  (if  such  a  phrase

thought  they  were ;  see  A  40  =  B  56-7. 

8  When  the  idea  of  red  colour  is  logically  extracted  or  abstracted, 
it  is  used  as  a  common  'mark',  and  so  possesses  universality.  Compare 
Anthr.  §  3  (VII  131).  It  is  in  short  'redness*.

may  be  permitted)  of  things :  we  are  leaving  out  or  eliminating 
spatial  and  temporal  objects  ;x  and  we  are  then  left  with  space 
and  time  as  individual  wholes.  These  unique  individual  wholes 
we  know  to  be  infinite,  and  they  are  the  condition  of  all  such 
relational  qualities  as  being  outside  and  beside,  or  before 
and  after. 

This  doctrine  is  of  great  importance.  It  shows  that  our 
intuitions  of  space  and  time  are  'exhibited  in  their  purity'2 
only  by  an  act  of  abstraction  following  upon  the  perception 
of  empirical  objects  ;3  and  it  shows  that  the  method  of  abstrac- 
tion involved  in  such  pure  intuitions  is  different  from  the 
method  of  abstraction  involved  in  conception.4

and  'absondern'  as  practically  synonymous.  Compare  Log.  §  6  (IX  94).

SPACE    AND    TIME— TRANSCENDENTAL    EXPOSI- 
TION AND  CONCLUSIONS 

§  i.  Transcendental  Exposition  of  Space  and  Time 

In  spite  of  its  formidable  name  the  Transcendental  Exposi- 
tion is  comparatively  simple.  In  regard  to  space  it  amounts 
to  this,  that  the  judgements  of  geometry  are  synthetic  a  priori 
judgements.  In  order  to  be  synthetic  they  must  rest  upon 
intuition,  and  in  order  to  be  a  priori  they  must  rest  upon  pure 
intuition.  We  have  already  in  the  Metaphysical  Exposition 
shown  that  space  is  a  pure  intuition.  We  now  find  that  unless 
space  were  such  a  pure  intuition,1  geometrical  judgements 
could  not  have  the  necessity  and  universality  which  they  as 
a  matter  of  fact  have.  Unless  space  were  a  pure  intuition,  we 
could  not  say  that  there  is  only  one  straight  line  between 
any  two  points,2  nor  could  we  say  that  space  has  only  three 
dimensions.3  We  could  say  only  that  so  far  as  our  experience 
went,  we  had  found  it  to  be  so. 

A  similar  argument  is  used  in  regard  to  time,  except  that 
here  we  have  no  complete  science  comparable  to  geometry. 
We  are  simply  referred  to  certain  synthetic  a  priori  principles 
of  time  relations,  or  axioms  of  time  in  general.4  Such  axioms 
are  'Time  has  only  one  dimension';  'Different  times  are  not 
simultaneous  but  successive*. 

A  further  argument  is  added  in  the  second  edition.5  Apart 
from  time  as  an  a  priori  intuition  we  could  have  no  under- 
standing of  change  (including  motion,  which  is  change  of 
place).  The  understanding  of  change  involves  the  attribution 
of  contradictory  predicates  to  the  same  subject,  and  this  for 

1  That  is,  an  object  of  pure  intuition,  though  of  a  paradoxical 
kind.  Compare  B  160  n.

4  A  31  =  647.  5  648-9. 


128  SPACE  AND  TIMB  [VI  §  x 

thinking  by  itself  is  impossible.1  It  becomes  possible  only 
when  we  realise  that  contradictory  predicates  can  belong  to 
the  same  thing  at  different  times.  Time  is  therefore  the  necessary 
and  universal  condition  of  our  apprehending  change  and 
motion.  It  can  be  so  only  as  a  pure  intuition,  since  thought 
by  itself  cannot  supply  such  a  condition. 

Furthermore  this  view  of  our  idea  of  time  can  alone  explain 
the  'general  doctrine  of  motion',  which  Kant  regards  as  com- 
posed of  synthetic  a  priori  judgements. 

We  have  thus  two  contentions.  Time  must  be  pure  intuition, 
firstly  if  we  can  know  certain  axioms  about  time  itself,  and 
secondly  if  we  are  to  understand  the  concept  of  change  and 
the  general  theory  of  motion. 

Kant  is  making  an  effort  to  discover  a  synthetic  a  priori 
science  of  time,  corresponding  to  geometry  as  a  science  of 
space.  There  is  no  such  science.  Since  time  is  one-dimensional, 
the  science  of  time  does  not  advance  beyond  such  axioms  as 
Kant  has  himself  stated. 

To  remedy  this  he  has  to  bring  in  change  and  motion, 
but  change2  and  motion3  are  not  wholly  free  from  empirical 
elements,  and  are  not  on  the  same  footing  as  time  and  space. 
Furthermore  the  science  of  geometry  takes  account  of  space 
only,  and  not  of  time,  whereas  the  doctrine  of  motion  must 
take  account  of  both  space  and  time.  Since  time  is  the  form 
of  inner  sense,  a  pure  science  of  time  should  enable  us  to 
deal  a  priori  with  inner  states  (not  with  moving  bodies),  and 
should  offer  a  basis  for  psychology  rather  than  for  physics.4 

Nevertheless  if  time  as  a  pure  intuition  is  necessary  to 
explain  the  axioms  which  Kant  has  propounded,  we  should 
perhaps  be  prepared  to  accept  his  doctrine  of  time,  provided 
he  could  demonstrate  that  the  corresponding  view  of  space 
was  necessary  to  geometry. 

1  The  law  of  non-contradiction,  as  stated  in  Formal  Logic,  should 
have  no  reference  to  time.  See  A  152-3  =  B  191-2  and  compare 
Chapter  XXXV  §  2.  2  B  3.  '^41=658. 

4  The  precise  nature  of  the  'doctrine  of  motion*  is  a  further 
difficulty. 


VI  §  i]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  129 

So  far  the  Transcendental  Exposition  is  concerned  to  prove 
only  that  space  and  time  are  pure  intuitions — in  the  sense  that 
knowing  space  and  time  we  can  say  what  their  parts  must 
be.  For  example,  knowing  space  we  can  construct  geometrical 
figures  in  it  a  priori  in  accordance  with  a  concept,1  and  it 
is  this  which  enables  us  to  prove  geometrical  propositions. 
We  have  not  yet  maintained  that  pure  geometry  must  apply 
to  the  actual  world,  and  that  therefore  our  pure  intuition  of 
space  must  contain  the  form  of  all  appearances.  Still  less 
have  we  attempted  to  show  that  space  must  therefore  be  of 
subjective  origin.2 

Kant  introduces  both  these  points  in  the  third  paragraph 
of  the  Transcendental  Exposition  of  Space.3  It  may  be  argued 
that  this  ought  to  be  done,  if  the  exposition  is  to  be  strictly 
transcendental.  The  word  'transcendental'  usually  implies, 
not  only  that  we  show  a  cognition  to  be  a  priori,  but  also  that 
we  do  so  by  ascribing  its  origin  to  the  mind.4  Nevertheless 
these  points  are  not  introduced  in  the  Transcendental 
Exposition  of  Time,  and  for  the  sake  of  clarity  the 
subjectivity  of  space  and  time  ought  to  be  reserved  for  the 
'Conclusions'. 

The  Transcendental  Exposition  as  a  whole  is  stronger  in 
regard  to  space  than  in  regard  to  time,  for  the  temporal  science 
parallel  to  geometry  is,  at  the  best,  a  trifle  shadowy.  It  is  for 
this  reason  that  in  the  Aesthetic  space  is  more  prominent 
than  time.  The  exact  contrary  is  the  case  in  the  Analytic, 

1  Pro/.  §  7  (IV  281).  Kant  properly  does  not  himself  talk  of  con- 
struction till  he  comes  to  the  Analytic. 

2  I   think  it  legitimate  to  use   this  phrase;  compare  'subjective 
condition*  in  A  26  =  B  42   and  A  33  =  B  49.    Kant  himself    uses 
Subjective  origin*  for  the  way  in  which  the  individual  acquires  a 
cognition.  He  uses  'objective  origin'  for  the  sources  from  which  alone 
a  cognition  is  possible,  even  although  these  sources  are  to  be  found 
in  the  human  mind  as  such.  See  Log.  EM.  Ill  (IX  22).

(IV  293):  'The  word  "transcendental'*  which  with  me  never  means 
a  relation  of  our  knowledge  to  things,  but  only  to  the  faculty  of 
knowledge.  .  .  .' 

VOL,  I  E 


130  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VI  §a 

though  even  there  the  tendency  of  Kant's  thought  in  the 
second  edition  is  to  give  space  more  prominence  than  it  had 
in  the  first. 

§  2.  Synthetic  and  Analytic  Argument 

Kant's  argument  may  be  looked  at  in  two  ways.  He  may 
be  said  to  offer  a  justification  of  geometry  by  his  theory  of 
space  as  a  pure  intuition.  He  may  also  be  said  to  justify  his 
theory  of  space  on  the  ground  that  it  alone  is  consistent  with 
the  validity  of  geometry.  The  first  type  of  argument  Kant 
regarded  as  progressive  or  synthetic — it  passes  from  the 
condition  to  the  conditioned.  The  second  type  of  argument 
he  regarded  as  regressive  or  analytic — it  passes  from  the 
conditioned  to  the  condition.1  Taken  by  itself  the  Trans- 
cendental Exposition  belongs  to  the  second  type;  but  taken 
in  conjunction  with  the  Metaphysical  Exposition  it  can  be 
made  to  fit  into  an  argument  of  the  first  type.  The  Metaphysical 
Exposition  establishes  Kant's  theory  of  space  by  an  examination 
of  the  idea  of  space  itself:  the  Transcendental  Exposition 
shows  that  the  theory  thus  independently  established  is 
alone  able  to  account  for  the  possibility  of  geometrical 
science.  Hence  the  argument  as  a  whole  can  be  said  to 
move  progressively  or  synthetically  from  the  condition  to 
the  conditioned.2 

§  3.  Conclusions 

The  Metaphysical  and  Transcendental  Expositions,  if  they 
are  successful,  have  established  the  principle  that  space  and 
time  are  pure  intuitions  (in  the  sense  of  being  known  by 
pure  intuition).  These  pure  intuitions  are  for  Kant  the  condition 
of  all  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  space  and  time,  including 

1  The  distinction  is  as  old  as  Euclid.  See  Pappus  of  Alexandria, 
Collectio,  Book  VII  (Vol.  II,  p.  634  of  the  edition  of  Hultsch)  and 
Heath,  A  History  of  Greek  Mathematics,  Vol.  II,  p.  400. 

8  Broadly  speaking,  the  whole  argument  of  the  Kritik  aims  at 
being  progressive,  while  the  argument  of  the  Prolegomena  aims  at 
being  regressive.  Compare  ProL  Vorw.  and  §  4  (IV  263  and  274-5). 


VI  §  3]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  131 

not  only  general  axioms  but  detailed  propositions — such  as 
those  of  pure  geometry.  The  content  of  these  pure  intuitions 
is  the  formal  spatial  and  temporal  relations  in  which  all 
appearances  must  be  given  to  us ;  or  in  Kant's  language  space 
and  time  are  forms  of  appearances. 

We  have  now  to  take  a  step  forward,  and  to  argue  for  the 
subjectivity,  or  transcendental  ideality,  of  space  and  time.  This 
transcendental  ideality  may  be  expressed  by  saying  that  space 
and  time  are  forms  of  our  sensibility — that  they  are  due,  not 
to  the  nature  of  the  things  which  appear  to  sense,  but  to  the 
nature  of  the  human  sensibility  to  which  these  things  appear. 

As  usual,  Kant  fails  to  maintain  an  exact  parallelism  in  his 
different  accounts  of  space  and  time.  This  is  partly  due  to 
carelessness,  but  partly  also  to  the  fact  that  the  characteristics 
of  time  differ  in  certain  ways  from  those  of  space.1 

The  argument  may  be  put  briefly.  A  priori  knowledge2 — 
knowledge,  that  is  to  say,  which  as  necessary  and  universal 
is  independent  of  experience — cannot  be  derived  from  experi- 
ence.3 It  must  therefore  be  derived  from  the  knowing  mind. 
This  means,  for  Kant,  that  whatever  is  known4  a  priori  cannot 
be  given  from  the  side  of  the  thing  known,  but  must  be  contri- 
buted by  the  mind  itself.5  If  we  accept  the  view  that  space 
and  time  are  known  a  priori,  we  must  therefore  hold  that 
space  and  time  are  due  to  the  nature  of  the  mind,  in  this 
case  to  our  sensibility. 

1  Conclusions  (a)  and  (b)  for  space  are  roughly  parallel  to  con- 
clusion (a)  for  time,  and  conclusions  (b)  and  (c)  for  time  have  (apart 
from  the  first  sentence  of  (b))  no  parallels  under  space. 

8  This  covers  knowledge  in  the  full  sense  and  also  the  intuitions 
or  conceptions  which  are  elements  in  such  knowledge. 

8  On  the  other  hand,  it  could  not  arise  apart  from  experience,  and 
it  is  gradually  sorted  out  from  experience  (or  made  'clear'  to  the 
mind)  by  reflective  analysis;  see  B  1-2. 

4  Or  conceived  or  intuited  a  priori. 

6  Whatever  is  merely  given  in  the  thing  known  can,  Kant  believes, 
be  known  only  as  empirical  fact.  Since  in  knowledge  there  are  only 
two  factors  present,  the  thing  known  and  the  knowing  mind,  what 
is  known  a  priori  must  be  given,  not  in  the  thing  known,  but  in  the 
mind  which  knows. 


1 32  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VI  §4 

§  4.  The  Newtonian  View 

Kant  has  already,  it  will  be  remembered,  set  forth  three 
possibilities.1  Space  and  time  are  either  (i)  real  things,  i.e. 
things-in-themselves,  or  (2)  determinations  or  relations  of  real 
things,  or  (3)  forms  of  our  sensibility.  The  arguments  used  in 
regard  to  these  three  possibilities  must  be  expounded  briefly: 
criticism  is  reserved  till  later. 

The  first  of  these,  which  is  the  view  of  Newton,  Kant  does 
not  take  very  seriously.  He  fails  to  mention  it  here  in  connexion 
with  space.2  In  connexion  with  time  he  says  only  that  if  time 
were  something  existing  by  and  for  itself,  it  would  then  be 
something  which  without  a  real  object  would  none  the  less 
be  real.3  Clearly  he  regards  time  (and  presumably  space)  as 
nothing  apart  from  objects  in  time,  although  in  thought  we 
can  eliminate  sensible  objects  from  it  and  cognise  it  in  pure 
intuition.4  He  says  later  that  on  the  Newtonian  hypothesis 
space  and  time  would  be  two  eternal  and  infinite  self-subsistent 
nonentities  or  'unthings'  (Undinge),  which  are  there — without 
anything  real  being  there — merely  in  order  to  receive  every- 
thing real  into  themselves.5  He  adds  that  such  a  theory  can 
account  for  the  application  of  mathematical  truths  to  the  world 
of  appearances — he  does  not  say  whether  it  could  account  also 
for  the  possibility  of  pure  geometry — but  that  its  upholders 
become  embarrassed  when  understanding  seeks  to  go  beyond 
the  world  of  appearances6.  This  contention,  not  here  explained, 
may  perhaps  be  alluded  to  later,  when  he  says  that  to  make 
space  and  time  forms  of  things-in-themselves  is  to  make  them 
conditions  of  all  existence,  including  the  existence  of  God.7

cept of  which  is  self-contradictory;  see  A  292  =  6348.   In  A  291 
=  B  347,  where  Kant  is  stating  his  own  view,  space  and  time  are 
not  nonentities  but  imaginary  entities.  See  also  Diss.  §  14,  6  (II  401).

or  possibly  to  Malebranche,  see  Diss.  §  22  Scholion  (II  410). 


VI  §5]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  133 

A  further  criticism  is  to  be  found  in  the  first  two  Anti- 
nomies. 

It  can  hardly  be  denied  that  in  the  Aesthetic  Kant's  criticism 
of  this  view  is  inadequate.  He  seems  to  take  it  as  the  view  of 
physicists  who  have  never  thought  out  its  metaphysical 
implications.1 

§  5.  The  Leibnizian  View 

The  view  against  which  Kant's  arguments  are  mainly 
directed  is  the  Leibnizian  view.  In  it  space  and  time  are 
relations  of  appearances,  relations  abstracted  from  experience 
and  represented  confusedly  in  abstraction  ;2  indeed  our  whole 
sensibility  is  only  the  confused  representation  of  real 
things.3 

Kant  argues  later  against  making  the  difference  between  the 
sensible  and  the  intelligible  a  mere  logical  difference  between 
the  confused  and  the  distinct.4  It  is  on  the  contrary  a  trans- 
cendental difference,  that  is,  one  originating  in  different  powers 
in  the  mind  and  implying  a  difference  in  the  content.5  On  this 
point  I  imagine  few  would  support  the  Leibnizian  view 
to-day. 

In  the  passages  referred  to  as  *  Conclusions'  Kant  simplifies 
the  Leibnizian  view.  Ignoring  the  doctrine  of  Confusion',  he 
takes  this  view  to  assert  that  space  and  time  are  characteristics 
of  things  independently  of  the  subjective  conditions  of  our 
intuition.6  In  that  case,  he  argues,  our  knowledge  of  space 

1  Compare  Diss.  §  14,  5  and  §  15  D  (II  400  and  403-4). 

2  A  40  =  B  56-7.  'Relations'  here  would  seem  to  be  'relationships' 
or  relational  qualities,  and  our  ideas  of  space  and  time  to  be  concepts 
of  such  common  relational  qualities. 

8  A  43  =  B  60;  A  267  =  B  323 ;  A  276  =  B  332.  It  would  be 
better  to  say  that  our  sensing  is  only  a  confused  conceiving. 

4  A  43  =  B  60  ff.  *  A  44  =  B  61-2. 

6  This  is  the  more  general  case  of  which  the  Leibnizian  doctrine 
is  a  special  form.  'Characteristics'  or  'determinations'  (Bestimmungen) 
include  inner  qualities  and  outer  relations:  in  A  26  =  642  the 
former  are  called  absolute,  and  the  latter  relative,  characteristics. 
In  A  33  =  B  49  this  distinction  is  put  awkwardly  as  a  distinction 
between  'characteristic'  and  'order'. 


i34  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VI  §6 

and  time  would  be  a  mere  generalisation  from  experience.  We 
can  make  assertions  about  the  characteristics  of  things-in- 
themselves,  only  so  far  as  we  have  actually  experienced  the 
things.1  Hence  if  space  and  time  were  characteristics  of  things- 
in-themselves,  we  could  never  attain  the  apodeictic  certainty 
of  mathematics,  nor  could  we  assert  that  the  truths  discovered 
in  mathematics  must  hold  of  the  real  world.2 

If  this  contention  were  sound,  it  would  be  fatal  to  the  view 
that  space  and  time  are  characteristics  of  things  as  they  are  in 
themselves.  We  must  find  some  way  of  explaining  why  the 
physical  world  necessarily  conforms  to  the  discoveries  of  pure 
mathematics — provided  always  we  are  entitled  to  the  assump- 
tion that  it  must  so  conform. 

§  6.  The  Kantian  View 

Kant's  own  view  is  that  space  and  time  are  forms  of  human 
sensibility,  that  is  to  say,  they  are  due  to  the  nature  of  our 
sensibility.  They  are  forms  under  which  things  must  appear 
to  us,  not  forms  of  things-in-themselves.  What  is  given  to 
sense  still  implies  the  reality  of  things-in-themselves ;  appear- 
ances are  still  appearances  of  things-in-themselves;  yet  the 
universal  spatial  and  temporal  relations  of  the  given  can  be 
in  no  way  due  to  things-in-themselves,  but  only  to  our  sensi- 
bility. No  doubt  it  must  be  due  to  something  in  things-in- 
themselves  that  we  see  one  table  as  round  and  another  as 
square;3  but  if  things-in-themselves  are  not  spatial,  this  some- 
thing cannot  be  roundness  or  squareness,  and  its  real  nature 
must  be  to  us  for  ever  unknown4.  Things-in-themselves  do 

1  A  26  —  B  42 ;  A  33  =  B  49.  Kant's  doctrine  is  that  since  a  char- 
acteristic (of  whatever  kind)  is  logically  dependent  upon  the  object 
of  which  it  is  the  characteristic,  it  cannot  be  the  condition  of  such 
an  object;  consequently  we  cannot  intuit  it  except  in  so  far  as  the 
object  is  given  to  us,  that  is,  we  cannot  intuit  it  a  priori. 

a  A  40  =  B  57. 

8  This  view  of  Kant's  doctrine  is  commonly  denied,  but  it  seems 
to  me  the  only  view  which  can  make  his  theory  intelligible.  Compare 
§  8  below. 

4  The  real  characteristics  might  conceivably  be  thoughts  (A  359-60). 


VI  §6]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  135 

not  migrate  unchanged  into  our  minds.  As  they  appear  to  us, 
they  become  subject  to  the  spatial  and  temporal  forms  of  our 
sensibility.  We  know  them  only  as  they  appear,  and  not  as 
they  are. 

It  should  be  clearly  understood  that  Kant's  main  argument 
is  not  from  the  subjectivity  of  sensible  appearances  to  the 
subjectivity  of  space  and  time  as  intimately  bound  up  with 
sensible  appearances.1  It  is  precisely  the  reverse.  Since  space 
and  time  are  known  a  priori,  they  must  be  subjective  in  origin, 
and  therefore  the  sensible  appearances  of  which  they  are  the 
form  must  be  partly  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  mind. 
In  the  earlier  stages  of  the  argument  we  were  entitled  to  keep 
open  the  possibility  that  these  appearances  were  identical  with 
things-in-themselves  (or  rather  were  the  things-in-themselves, 
not  only  as  they  appear,  but  also  as  they  are).  That  possibility 
is  now,  on  Kant's  principle,  excluded;  and  henceforward  when 
we  say  that  space  and  time  are  forms  of  appearances,  we 
imply  that  these  appearances  are  things,  not  as  they  are  in 
themselves,  but  only  as  they  appear  to  us. 

If  we  ignore  the  fact  that  Kant's  argument  is  always  from 
necessity  and  universality,  we  are  bound  to  find  it  dogmatic 
and  even  incomprehensible.  We  may,  for  example,  fall  into 
the  common  mistake  of  supposing  that  his  whole  case  rests 
on  the  unexamined  assumption  that  relations,  and  especially 
spatial  and  temporal  relations,  cannot  be  given  along  with 
sensation.2  On  the  contrary,  Kant  always  assumes  that  sensa 
(and  so  objects)  are  always  given  to  us  in  spatial  and  temporal 
relations,  of  which  space  and  time  are  the  conditions.3  This 
is,  in  fact,  what  he  means  when  he  says  that  space  and  time 
are  forms  of  intuition  or  of  appearances.  His  argument  is 

1  In  places  (e.g.  B  68)  Kant  does  suggest  independently  that  the 
senses  can  never  give  us  the  qualities  of  things-in-themselves,  but 
this  is  rather  a  corroboration  than  a  premise  of  his  main  argument. 

2  Even  the  combinati  n  of  the  manifold  (though  it  belongs  to 
understanding,  not  to  sensibility)  is  given  along  with,  although  not 
in,  intuition;  see  B  161. 

3  Compare  Lindsay,  Kant,  p.  67:  'Kant  is  putting  space  and  time 
on  the  side  of  the  given.' 


136  SPACE  AND  TIME  VI  §  7 

not  at  all  that  relations  as  such  must  be  due  to  the  nature  of 
the  mind.1  His  argument  is  that  space  and  time,  as  the  universal 
and  necessary  system  of  relations  which  is  the  condition  of  the 
particular  relations  in  which  appearances  are  given,  must  be 
due  to  the  nature  of  the  mind.2  More  will  be  said  on  this  point 
later  on3. 

Kant  believes  that  the  difficulties  which  arise  when  we  regard 
space  and  time  either  as  things-in-themselves,  or  as  characteris- 
tics of  things-in-themselves,  will  disappear  when  we  regard 
them  as  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.  If  we  accept  his 
hypothesis,  'it  can  be  readily  understood'  both  how  the  form 
of  appearances  can  be  given  prior  to  all  actual  sense-perceptions, 
and  also  how  we  can  have  a  pure  intuition  whose  content  is 
this  form.  The  reason  for  this  assertion  is  that  our  sensibility, 
our  receptivity  or  capacity  to  be  affected  by  objects,  precedes 
all  intuition  of  these  objects.4 

§  7.  Temporal  Priority 

Here  our  capacity  to  be  affected  by  objects  precedes  in 
time  all  our  actual  intuitions.  It  may  be  argued  that  Kant 
must  therefore  have  supposed  our  pure  intuitions  of  space 
and  time  to  precede  all  our  actual  sensuous  intuitions.  This 
is  however  admittedly  false,  not  to  say  ludicrous,  and  it  is 


1  In  B  67  Kant  suggests  that  through  mere  relations  things-in- 
themselves  cannot  be  known,  but  this  is  a  quite  different  argument 
(and  also  a  sound  argument;  see  Chapter  LI  1 1  §  4).  It  is  in  any  case 
peculiar  to  the  second  edition. 

2  Kant  indeed  says  that  the  form  in  which  sensations  are  arranged 
cannot  itself  be  sensation  (A  20  =  B  34) ;  but  he  is  referring  (as  is 
perfectly  clear  if  we  analyse  his  complicated  assertion  in  detail),  not 
to  the  particular  relations  (or  empirical  forms)  in  which  sensations 
are  arranged,  but  to  the  universal  forms  of  space  and  time,  which  are 
the  condition  of  all  such  particular  relations  or  forms.  The  assertion, 
moreover,  should  not  be  taken  as  a  premise  of  his  argument,  but 
rather    as    a    provisional    statement    of   his    conclusions;    compare 
Chapter  IV  §  2.  8  See  §  8  below. 

4  Compare  conclusion  (b)  in  regard  to  space  (A  26  =  642),  and 
also  the  end  of  conclusion  (a)  in  regard  to  time  (A  33  =  B  49). 


VI  §8]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  137 

explicitly  rejected  by  Kant  elsewhere,1  so  that  it  is  not  only 
the  more  charitable,  but  also,  I  think,  the  truer  view,  to 
suppose  that  in  spite  of  his  terminology  he  means  nothing 
quite  so  crude.  We  can  indeed  say  that  any  human  being 
has,  on  Kant's  theory,  even  before  experience  has  begun, 
such  a  sensuous  nature  that  all  objects  must  appear  to  it  in 
space  and  time.  Since  the  phrase  'form  of  sensibility'  is  used 
ambiguously  (not  only  for  the  form  of  appearances  as  due 
to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility,  but  also  for  the  nature  of 
the  sensibility  to  which  this  form  is  due),2  we  can  even  say 
that  the  form  of  sensibility  (in  the  latter  sense)  precedes  all 
experience!  But  when  we  are  told  that  pure  intuition  must 
be  prior  to  all  experience,  we  must  take  this  to  mean  either 
that  it  is  logically  prior  to  experience,  a  condition  of  experience 
and  not  a  generalisation  from  it;  or  else  that  we  can  have 
this  pure  intuition  before  any  particular  experience  that  we 
care  to  name.3 

Such  an  interpretation  of  Kant  is  in  any  case  the  only  one 
which  can  have  any  chance  of  withstanding  criticism.  Whether 
it  offers  an  easy  solution  of  Kant's  difficulties  demands  further 
examination  than  he  has  given  it.  There  is  always  a  danger  in 
philosophy,  as  Kant  himself  recognises,  that  we  may  accept 
a  disproof  of  our  opponents'  theories  as  a  proof  of  our  own. 

§  8.  Form  and  Matter 

Kant  believes  that  it  is  possible  to  consider  form  and  matter 
in  abstraction  from  one  another.4  In  the  Aesthetic  he  considers 

1  For  example  Diss.  §  14,  5  and  §  15  Corollarium  (II  401  and  406); 
and  again  Streitschrift  (VIII  221).  I  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  Kant 
could  be  perfectly  clear  on  this  point,  both  in  1770  and  in  1790,  and 
yet  could  talk  nonsense  about  it  in  1781.  And  indeed  this  nonsense 
is  explicitly  repudiated  in  A  292  =  B  349. 

8  Compare  Chapter  IV  §  5. 

3  In  ProL  §7  (IV  281)  the  last  clause  *vor  alter  Erfahrung  oder 
einzelnen  Wahrnehmung*  perhaps  suggests  that  'before  all  experience* 
is  equivalent  to  'before  perceiving  the  individual  object  in  question*. 
Compare  the  last  sentence  of  the  following  subsection,  'How  can 
intuition  of  the  object  precede  the  object  itself?'

the  form  of  appearances  (space  and  time)  apart  from  the  matter. 
In  the  Anticipations  of  Sense-perception1  he  may  be  said — 
though  this  requires  qualification — to  consider  the  matter  in 
abstraction  from  the  form.2  The  whole  Kritik  of  Pure  Reason 
may  be  described  as  an  analysis  of  our  experience  into  its 
formal  and  material  elements.  An  analysis  of  this  kind  need 
not  imply  that  we  have  first  the  matter  and  then  the  form, 
or  first  the  form  and  then  the  matter ;  and  I  see  no  sufficient 
ground  for  attributing  such  a  mistaken  psychological  theory 
to  Kant. 

This  psychological  interpretation  of  Kant  is  the  source  of 
many  errors,  It  is,  I  think,  the  main  source  of  the  commonly 
accepted  view  that  Kant  took  over  Hume's  doctrine  of  sensa- 
tions as  isolated  and  unrelated  atomic  entities.  For  this  view 
I  can  find  no  sufficient  evidence.3  Kant's  psychology  seems  to 
me  closely  related  to  that  of  Baumgarten  and  Tetens,  and  in 
certain  respects  to  that  of  Leibniz,  rather  than  to  that  of 
Hume.  It  is  obvious  that  if  we  abstract  from  the  spatial  and 
temporal  form  of  intuition,  what  is  left  in  intuition  is  sen- 
sation which  can  have  no  extensive  quantity.4  It  is  equally 
obvious  that  if  we  abstract  from  the  unity  of  intuition 
(which  as  universal  is  for  Kant  due  to  the  mind),  what  is  left 
will  be  a  mere  'manifold'  without  unity.  Kant  certainly 
makes  both  these  statements;  but  this  does  not  justify  the 
interpretation  that  we  first  of  all  acquire  isolated  sensations, 
and  then  impose  upon  them  the  forms  of  space  and  time5

3  Compare  Lindsay,  Kant,  p.  15.  This  is  a  difficult  question,  and 
further  points  will  be  raised  in  Chapters  XIX  §  i,  XLII  §  i,  and 
XLVI  §  3. 

4  Compare  B  208. 

6  In  another  connexion  Kant  says  explicitly  that  empirical  intuition 
is  not  compounded  (zusammengesetzt)  out  of  appearances  and  space 
(sense-perception  and  empty  intuition).  On  the  contrary,  sense- 
perception  and  the  intuition  of  space  are  conjoined  (verbunden)  only 
in  one  and  the  same  empirical  intuition  as  its  matter  and  form.  See 
A  429  n.  =  B  457  n.  Although  this  is  a  note  to  the  antithesis  of  the 
First  Antinomy,  it  can,  I  think,  be  taken  as  expressing  Kant's  own 


VI  §  8]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  139 

and  the  unity  without  which  there  would  be  no  empirical 
objects.1 

This  psychological  interpretation  has  another  result,  which 
also  appears  to  me  to  be  erroneous.  It  is  generally  admitted 
that  Kant  offers  no  precise  statement  as  to  the  reason  why 
one  object  appears  to  us  as  square  and  another  as  round;  but 
it  is  commonly  held  that  all  such  differences  of  shape  must 
be  imposed  only  by  the  nature  of  our  minds.  The  ground  for 
this  would  seem  to  be  that  because  space  and  time  are  for  Kant 
imposed  wholly  by  the  mind,  therefore  squareness  and  circu- 
larity must  be  imposed  wholly  by  the  mind.2  If  sensa  are  not 
spatial,  how  can  they  be  round  or  square? 

This  contention  would  be  irresistible,  if  Kant  supposed  that 
sensations  could  really  exist  apart  from  space  and  time.  If  we 
refuse  to  accept  such  an  interpretation,  the  argument  loses  its 
force.  I  believe  that  the  empirical  differences  in  the  shapes 
and  sizes  of  objects,  like  their  empirical  qualitative  differences, 
must  be  ascribed  to  the  'influence'  of  things-in-them- 
selves. 

The  commonly  accepted  doctrine  destroys  the  distinction, 
upon  which  Kant  always  insists,  between  empirical  and  universal 
laws  and  between  empirical  and  universal  concepts.3  Only  what 
is  strictly  universal  is  imposed  by  the  mind  upon  objects. 

view.  Indeed  what  is  the  sense  of  talking  about  space  and  time  as 
the  conditions  under  which  alone  an  object  can  be  given,  if  what 
is  given  (namely  sensation)  is  given  quite  independently  of  these 
conditions  ? 

1  As  we  shall  see  later,  this  view  makes  havoc  of  the  Transcen- 
dental Deduction.  Compare  especially  Chapter  XXXI  §  4. 

2  By  parity  of  reasoning,  since  causality  is  wholly  imposed  by  the 
mind,  every  particular  causal  connexion  must  be  wholly  imposed  by 
the  mind;  but  if  so,  it  could  be  known  a  priori,  whereas  Kant  always 
insists  it  must  be  discovered  by  experience.  Similarly  since  degree 
is  imposed  wholly  by  the  mind,  every  particular  degree  must  be 
wholly  imposed  by  the  mind.  On  such  a  view  sensations  would  be 
given  without  degree  as  well  as  without  extension.  Could  absurdity 
further  go?  On  my  view,  though  causality  and  degreeness  are  imposed 
by  the  mind,  every  particular  causal  connexion  and  every  particular 
degree  is  determined  by  the  nature  of  things-in-themselves.

Empirical  differences  are  particular  determinations  of  the 
universal,  but  their  particularity  is  not  due  to  the  mind 
and  must  be  due  to  things.1  If  this  view  be  given  up, 
I  do  not  see  how  the  Critical  Philosophy  can  be  made  in- 
telligible. 

It  is  true  that  Kant  insists  upon  this  point  mainly  in  reference 
to  the  categories,  but  the  same  principle  must  hold  for  space 
and  time.  This  is  sufficiently  brought  out  by  Kant  himself.2 
'Empirical  laws,  as  such,  can  never  derive  their  origin  from 
pure  understanding,  any  more  than  the  inexhaustible  multi- 
plicity of  appearances  can  be  adequately  understood  from  the 
pure  form  of  sensuous  intuition.'  This  'inexhaustible  multi- 
plicity' might  be  thought  to  be  only  the  manifold  differences 
in  quality  of  sensation;  but  Kant  goes  on  to  say  that  all 
empirical  laws  are  particular  determinations  of  the  pure  laws 
of  the  understanding,  just  as  all  appearances  are  subject  to 
the  conditions  of  the  pure  form  of  sensibility,  whatever  be 
the  differences  in  their  empirical  form?  On  the  prevailing  view 
when  Kant  says  'empirical  form',  he  would  have  to  mean 
'matter'.  It  seems  to  me  that  he  is  referring  (at  least  partly) 
to  shape  and  perhaps  size;  and  if  this  form  is  empirical,  it 
must  be  known  through  sensation. 

There  can  be  no  doubt  that  Kant  distinguishes  the  mathe- 
matical triangle  constructed  in  pure  intuition  from  the  empirical 
triangle,  the  concrete  triangular  object  known  through  sense.4 

1  What  is  common  to  all  objects  is  imposed  by  the  mind.  The 
differences  in  objects  must  be  due  to  the  nature  of  things.  This  is 
implied  in  B  69;  see  Chapter  LI II  §  7.

all  knowledge  of  objects'  in  A  129,  where  it  is  also  called  'the  intel- 
lectual form'.

'The  figurative  synthesis  by  which  we  construct  a  triangle  in 
imagination  is  wholly  identical  with  that  which  we  exercise 
in  the  apprehension  of  an  appearance  in  order  to  make  for 
ourselves  an  empirical  concept  of  it.'1  This  statement  is  not 
unambiguous,  but  I  believe  it  to  mean  that  in  the  apprehension 
of  an  empirical  triangle  we  are  compelled  by  the  nature  of 
our  sensations  to  synthetise  the  given  in  the  form  of  a  triangle, 
such  as  can  also  be  constructed  a  priori.  In  the  Kritik  of  Judge- 
ment we  are  definitely  told  that  'in  the  apprehension  of  a  given 
object  of  sense  the  imagination  is  bound  to  a  determinate 
form  of  that  object';  and  that  the  object  can  give  'precisely 
such  a  form*  as  might  be  used  by  the  imagination  in  a  free 
synthesis.2 

As  we  have  already  seen,  Kant  holds  that  we  cannot  perceive 
space  apart  from  matter.3  He  goes  even  farther  than  this  and 
speaks  of  space — the  space  in  which  we  perceive  movements — 
as  'sensible',4  that  is,  as  'designated'  or  'symbolised'5  through 
what  can  be  sensed,8  and  so  as  empirical.  The  same  doctrine  is 
implied  by  his  continual  references  to  the  empirical  determina- 
tion of  time.7  In  abstraction  from  the  forms  of  sensibility 
and  the  synthesis  of  the  imagination,  given  sensa  can  have  no 
spatial  or  temporal  characteristics.  Nevertheless  they  are  given 
concretely  under  the  forms  of  time  and  space,  and  are  never 
given  otherwise.  Whatever  be  the  part  played  by  mind  and 
by  the  thing-in-itself,  sensa  must  be  given  in  our  experience

in  §  2 1  he  speaks  of  a  given  object  bringing  the  imagination  by  means

is  given  a  posteriori  in  experience.

as  outside  and  beside,  before  and  after,  one  another;1  they 
'designate'  the  particular  spaces  and  times  which  they  occupy; 
they  compel  the  imagination  to  synthetise  them  in  certain 
empirical  forms,  which  must  accord  with  the  universal  and 
necessary  forms  of  time  and  space ;  they  are,  in  short,  given 
concretely2  (through  the  co-operation  of  things-in-themselves 
and  human  minds)  as  having  certain  shapes  and  sizes  and  as 
lasting  for  a  certain  time.  This,  I  believe,  is  the  basis  of  Kant's 
analysis  of  appearances  into  matter  and  form,  and  is  in  no 
way  incompatible  with  this  analysis.3 

The  interpretation  which  I  have  put  forward  does  not  imply 
that  we  know  things-in-themselves.  On  any  possible  view  we 
know  that  things-in-themselves  are  such  that  to  human  minds 
they  appear  as  light  and  heavy.  On  my  view  we  know  also 
that  things-in-themselves  are  such  that  to  human  minds  they 
also  appear  as  square  and  circular.  There  is  no  more  difficulty 
in  the  one  case  than  in  the  other,  and  neither  view  supposes 
that  we  know  things  as  they  are  in  themselves. 

It  is  regrettable  that  Kant  does  not  make  his  position  so 
clear  as  to  be  beyond  dispute.  Nevertheless  I  submit  that  my 
interpretation  alone  can  make  the  Critical  doctrine  reasonable 
and  consistent,  and  that  it  has  definite  support  in  Kant's  own 

1  In  the  Dissertation,  §  14,  5  (II  400)  in  connexion  with  time,  Kant 
speaks  of  'relationes  s.  respectus  quoscunque,  quatenus  sensibus  sunt 
obvii*. 

2  As  I  have  said,  if  we  abstract  entirely  from  the  contribution  of 
the  mind,  the  'given*  is  a  mere  multiplicity.  But  this  is  an  abstrac- 
tion   never  found  in  reality.    That  which    is    concretely   given    in 
experience  is  due  to  the  co-operation    of   things-in-themselves  and 
the  human  mind.  For  the  use  of  'given*,  see  B  130,  B  134,  B  161, 
B  163;  also  Chapter  XXVIII  §  10. 

8  The  importance  which  Kant  attaches  to  empirical  form  and 
structure  seems  to  me  generally  overlooked  by  modern  commentators. 
It  is  all  the  more  satisfactory  to  find  this  stressed  by  the  Master  of 
Balliol,  Kant,  pp.  65,  66,  105,  114.  The  doctrine  I  have  maintained 
is,  I  think,  supported  by  two  passages  he  cites  on  p.  72,  A  43 1  =  B  459 
and  M.A.d.N.  (IV  507  11. 7-8).  The  first  passage  is  as  follows :  'Things, 
as  appearances,  determine  space,  that  is,  of  all  its  possible  predicates 
of  magnitude  and  relation,  they  determine  this  or  that  particular 
one  to  belong  to  the  real.' 


VI  §  9]  TRANSCENDENTAL  EXPOSITION  143 

statements.1  I  believe  that  for  Kant  form  and  matter  are 
separable  only  in  thought,  and  that  although  the  universal 
form  is  due  to  the  nature  of  our  minds,  the  particular  form  is 
determined  by  the  thing-in-itself  'affecting'  human  minds.2  It 
is  at  the  very  least  worth  while  finding  out  how  far  this  interpre- 
tation can  explain  the  argument  of  the  Kritik  as  it  develops, 
for  the  opposite  interpretation  attributes  to  Kant  a  view  which 
is  admittedly  indefensible. 

§  9.  Empirical  Reality,  Transcendental  Ideality 

Kant  sums  up  his  doctrine  in  the  phrase  that  space  and  time 
are  empirically  real,  but  transcendentally  ideal.3 

To  say  that  space  and  time  are  empirically  real  is  to  say 
that  they  are  objectively  valid  so  far  as  all  sensuous  experience 
is  concerned.4  Spatial  and  temporal  characteristics  (with  all 
that  they  imply)  must  necessarily  belong  to  all  objects  of 
human  experience,  whether  these  objects  be  regarded  as  mere 
private  sensa,  or  as  the  common  objects  which  these  private 
sensa  reveal  to  us.  If  we  consider  the  question  from  the  point 

1  A  detailed  criticism  of  the  alleged  evidence  on  the  other  side 
would  take  up  too  much  room.  I  would  insist,  however,  that  when 
Kant  speaks  of  the  form  of  appearance  in  A  20  =  B  34,  he  means  the 
universal  form,  which  admittedly  is  imposed  by  the  mind.  The 
universal  form  is  the  one  necessary  condition  of  sensations  being 
posited  or  arranged  'in  a  certain  form*,  that  is,  in  a  determinate  or 
empirical  form.  This  distinction,  which  I  think  is  also  to  be  found 
in  the  Dissertation,  must  always  be  kept  in  view.  The  Critical  argu- 
ment rests  always  on  the  strict  universality  of  the  form,  and  to  ignore 
this  is  to  throw  Kant's  whole  doctrine  into  confusion. 

a  A  rough  analogy  may  help  to  make  this  clearer.  If  we  are  wearing 
blue  spectacles,  the  blueness  of  things  is  imposed  by  our  spectacles, 
but  differences  in  the  shades  of  blueness  are  due,  not  to  the  nature 
of  our  spectacles,  but  to  the  influence  of  the  things.  Compare  Chap- 
ters VIII  §§  2-3  and  LIII  §§  7  and  9. 

3  A  28  =  B  44;  A  35-6  =  852.    It  should  be  noted  that   Kant 
later  describes  his  whole  philosophy  as  transcendental  idealism  but 
empirical   realism,   and   opposes   it  to   transcendental   realism.    See 
A  369  ff. ;  A  490  =  B  518  ff. ;  Prol  §  13  Anmerk.  Ill  and  §49  (IV  293 
and  337). 

4  I  use  Kant's  terminology.  It  would  be  better  to  say  that  the  ideas 
of  space  and  time  are  objectively  valid. 


144  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VI  §  9 

of  view  of  ordinary  experience,  all  the  objects  of  our  experience 
are,  and  must  be,  in  one  common  time  and  space. 

To  say  that  space  and  time  are  transcendentally  ideal  is  to 
say  that  they  are  nothing,  if  we  cease  to  regard  them  as  conditions 
of  sensuous  experience ;  we  cannot  class  them  with  things-in- 
themselves  either  by  regarding  them  as  substances  known 
through  pure  reason  or  by  regarding  them  as  determinations 
or  relations  of  such  substances.1  In  other  words,  from  the 
transcendental  point  of  view  spatial  and  temporal  charac- 
teristics belong  only  to  objects  of  experience,  not  to  things-in- 
themselves.2 

By  this  doctrine  Kant  is  able  to  avoid  the  disadvantages 
of  the  Newtonian  view  which  makes  space  and  time  forms 
of  things-in-themselves,3  and  consequently  conditions  of  all 

1  A  36  =  B  52.  As  a  result  of  his  argument  Kant  is  entitled  to 
assume  that  if  things-in-themselves  are  known  at  all,  it  must  be  not 
by  sensibility  but  by  pure  reason.  Compare  A  28  =  B  44. 

8  The  statement  that  space  and  time  are  'transcendentally  ideal' 
ought  to  mean  that  they  are  ideal  when  we  regard  them  from 
the  transcendental  point  of  view,  when  we  consider  that  (as 
universal  and  necessary)  they  must  have  their  origin  in  the  mind, 
and  therefore  are  nothing  apart  from  our  sensibility,  and  cannot 
apply  to  things-in-themselves.  I  am  not  sure  that  Kant  does  not 
mean  this — some  of  his  statements  support  such  an  interpretation. 
Nevertheless  he  identifies  'absolute*  and  'transcendental*  reality 
(A  36  =  B  53),  and  this  presents  a  real  difficulty.  It  might  indeed 
be  argued  that  a  thing  is  transcendentally  real,  that  is,  real  from  a 
transcendental  point  of  view,  when  we  ask  whether  its  reality  is  due 
to  the  nature  of  the  mind,  and  conclude  that  it  is  real  independently 
of  the  nature  of  mind,  and  so  absolutely  real.  But  Kant  may  be 
unconsciously  falling  back  on  an  older  meaning  of  'transcendental', 
and  it  is  perhaps  even  possible  that  he  may  be  confusing  it  with 
'transcendent*.  If  so,  his  looseness  of  terminology  is  regrettable,  but 
not  of  great  importance.  Only  a  very  ingenuous  kind  of  criticism  will 
regard  it  as  proving  that  this  passage  was  written  earlier,  or  even 
that  it  is  the  relic  of  an  older  view. 

Similar  difficulties  have  been  raised  about  Kant's  description  of 
his  philosophy  as  'transcendental  idealism'.  It  ought,  however,  to  be 
observed  that  in  two  passages  in  the  Prolegomena  Kant  asserts  that 
this  phrase  is  misunderstood,  and  that  'transcendental'  in  this  con- 
nexion has  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  'transcendent';  see  Prol. 
§  13  Anmerk.  Ill,  and  also  Anhang  (IV  293  and  373  n.).

existence,  even  of  the  existence  of  God.  He  is  also  able 
to  explain,  as  Leibniz  could  not,  how  pure  mathematics1  is 
possible,  and  how  its  results  must  necessarily  apply  to  all 
objects  of  experience.2

CHAPTER    VII 
SPACE  AND  TIME— KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS 

§  i.  Universality  of  Space 

If  space  and  time  are  to  serve  Kant's  purposes,  they  ought 
to  be  universal  and  necessary  conditions  of  all  objects  given 
to  sense.  It  can  hardly  be  maintained  that  Kant  has  shown 
space  to  be  such  a  condition,  and  at  the  very  outset  we  are 
met  with  difficulties.  Space  is  said  to  be  the  condition  of  outer 
experience  and  of  outer  intuitions.1  This  assertion  definitely 
restricts  or  limits  the  experience  of  which  space  is  said  to  be 
the  condition;  and  since  'outer'  means  'spatial',2  it  looks  like 
the  tautologous  statement  that  there  can  be  no  spatial  experience 
apart  from  space. 

Kant's  statement  is  not  really  tautologous:  his  contention 
is  not  merely  that  we  cannot  know  spatial  appearances  apart 
from  space,  but  also  that  we  can  know  space  apart  from  spatial 
appearances;  and  it  is  this  double  contention  which  entitles 
him  to  hold  that  space  is  the  condition  of  outer  experience.3 
Nevertheless  the  fact  remains  that  space  is  said  to  be  the  con- 
dition of  some  human  experience,  but  not  of  all. 

This  seems  to  me  to  be  a  real  difficulty,  and  one  which 
involves  Kant  in  continual  embarrassment  throughout  the 
Kritik.  There  can,  it  is  true,  be  universality  and  necessity 
with  a  limited  application,  as  in  geometrical  propositions  about 
triangles ;  and  space  may  be  said  to  be  universal  and  necessary 
within  its  own  sphere — the  sphere  of  outer  intuition.  But  the 
aim  of  Kant's  whole  discussion  is  to  determine  the  necessary 

1  A  23-4  =  B  38. 

2  I  think  it  implies  also  that  what  is  known  is  other  than  the  knower. 

3  Compare  Chapter  V  §  4,  and  also  §  5  below.  Colour,  for  example, 
is  not  in  the  same  sense  the  condition  of  coloured  appearances;  for 
although  we  cannot  know  coloured  appearances  apart  from  colour, 
we  have  no  power  of  knowing  colour  apart  from  coloured  appearances. 
Colour  is  simply  a  common  property  of  coloured  appearances,  not 
an  individual  and  intelligible  whole  which  can  be  studied  in  abstraction. 


VII  §  i]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  147 

conditions  of  all  human  experience;  and  although  in  the 
Principles  of  the  Understanding,  and  especially  in  the  Analogies, 
space  is  treated  as  such  a  necessary  condition,  this  treatment 
is  not  justified  by  the  argument  of  the  Aesthetic. 

There  are  indications,  even  in  the  first  edition,  that  Kant 
was  not  wholly  unconscious  of  this  difficulty.  There  he  asserts 
that  space  and  time,  taken  together,  are  the  pure  forms  of  all 
sensible  intuition;1  and  again  that  space  and  time  are  the 
necessary  conditions  of  all  (inner  and  outer)  experience.2  In 
the  second  edition  he  connects  space  more  closely  with  time, 
and  so  makes  it  look  more  like  a  condition  of  all  experience. 
The  whole  'stuff  of  our  experience  comes  to  us  from  outer 
sense.3  The  consciousness  of  my  own  existence  is  at  the  same 
time  an  immediate  consciousness  of  the  existence  of  other 
things  outside  me.4  It  is  only  through  outer  experience  that 
inner  experience  is  possible.6  We  need  not  merely  intuitions, 
but  always  outer  intuitions,  to  show  the  objective  reality  of 
the  categories.6  If  we  are  to  make  inner  changes  thinkable, 
we  must  do  so  through  outer  intuition,  representing  time  by 
means  of  a  line,  and  the  inner  changes  through  the  drawing 
of  the  line.7 

To  make  Kant's  doctrine  satisfactory  we  must  recognise 
that  space  and  time  are  ultimately  bound  up  together,  and 
that  space  is  the  mediate  condition  of  inner,  as  well  as  the 
immediate  condition  of  outer,  experience.  Kant's  thought  is 
tending  in  this  direction,  but — as  is  perhaps  inevitable  because 
of  the  time  at  which  he  wrote — his  treatment  of  the  subject, 
even  in  the  second  edition,  is  inadequate.  It  would  be  a  natural 
development  of  Kant's  doctrine  to  substitute  a  theory  of  space- 
time  for  separate  theories  of  space  and  time;  yet  such  a

view  is  already  present  in  the  Dissertation  of  1770,  §  15  Corollarium 
(II405). 


148  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §  2 

substitution  would  create  difficulties  in  regard  to  the  nature 
of  the  mind,  for  the  mind  seems  to  last  through  time,  but 
not  to  extend  through  space. 

§  2.  Universality  of  Time 

Similar  difficulties  might  be  raised  in  regard  to  time.  Time 
is  the  form  of  inner  sense  only,1  that  is,  of  the  intuition  of 
ourselves  and  of  our  inner  states ;  and  it  cannot  be  a  determina- 
tion of  outer  appearances.2 

It  seems  reasonable  enough  to  exclude  our  minds  and  inner 
states  from  space,  but  it  looks  paradoxical  to  exclude  outer 
appearances  from  time.  Why  should  time  belong  to  inner 
states  and  not  to  bodies  ?  Surely  change,  and  therefore  temporal 
position,  are  to  be  found  in  both  alike.  Motion  is  motion  of 
bodies,  and  apart  from  space  is  impossible.  As  Kant  himself 
says,  it  unites  the  two  elements  of  space  and  time.3 

His  paradox  is  supported  by  the  argument  that  time  belongs 
neither  to  shape  nor  to  position.  It  might  be  thought  from  this 
that  Kant  is  considering  only  the  characteristics  which  neces- 
sarily belong  to  everything  so  far  as  it  is  spatial.  This  restriction 
would  exclude  motion ;  for  the  concept  of  motion  presupposes 
empirical  perception  of  something  movable,  there  being  nothing 
movable  in  space  considered  in  itself.4 

Against  this  interpretation  we  have  to  set  the  statement  that 
time  cannot  be  outwardly  intuited.5  The  bald  assertion  that 
time  cannot  be  a  determination  of  outer  appearances  would 
seem  to  have  been  seriously  meant. 

Such  a  view  is  all  the  more  curious  because  the  whole 
argument  of  the  Analogies  turns  upon  the  supposition  that 
the  objective  time-order  of  events6  is  distinct  from  the  subjective 
time-order  of  our  apprehension.  In  the  Analogies,  however,  the 
objective  time-order  of  events  is  determined  by  thought  through 

1  A  33  =  B  49.  2  Compare  also  A  23  =  B  37. 

3  A4i  =  858.  In  A358  he  even  speaks  as  if  motion  were  given 
to  outer  sense.  *  A  41  =  B  58.  6  A  23  =  B  37. 

8  By  *  events'  Kant  means  primarily  physical  events. 


VII  §  2]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  149 

the  categories  of  substance,  cause  and  effect,  and  interaction. 
This  suggests  that  here  Kant  is  confining  himself  to  appearances 
so  far  as  they  are  immediately  intuited.  All  that  is  immediately 
given  to  us  in  time  is  the  stream  of  our  ideas  or  states  of  mind ; 
and  it  is  by  thought,  not  by  intuition,  that  we  ascribe  objective 
temporal  position  to  moving  bodies.  Hence  time  is  not  an 
immediate  determination  of  outer  appearances. 

If  this  is  Kant's  meaning,  it  is  strange  that  he  does  not  say 
so  more  explicitly. 

In  the  third  'Conclusio  we  getn'  a  little  more  light  on  this 
matter.  There  we  are  told  that  all  appearances,  that  is,  all 
objects  of  sense,  are  in  time,  and  necessarily  stand  in  time- 
relations.1  Time  is  the  formal  a  priori  condition  of  all  appear- 
ances.2 If  this  is  true,  time  has  in  human  experience  a  univer- 
sality which  would  save  it  from  the  difficulties  raised  above  in 
regard  to  space. 

The  justification  of  this  contention,  and  its  reconciliation 
with  the  previous  assertion,  is  left  in  some  obscurity.  Time, 
because  it  is  the  immediate  condition  of  inner  phenomena,  is 
also  the  mediate  condition  of  outer  phenomena.3  The  reason 
for  this  is  that  even  our  ideas  of  spatial  things  are,  if  we  take 
them  in  themselves,  determinations  or  states  of  our  minds, 
and  so  necessarily  in  time. 

This  supports  the  view  that  Kant  is  not  denying  time  to 
be  a  determination  of  outer  appearances,  but  only  denying  it 
to  be  an  immediate  determination  of  outer  appearances.  He 
appears  to  hold  that  outer  intuition  as  such  gives  us  only  the 
spatially  extended.  Our  awareness  of  a  changing  spatial  world 

1  A  34  =  851.  See  also  A  35  =  B  52. 

a  A  34  =  B  50.  Compare  Dissertation,  §  15  Corollarium  (II  405). 

8  Kant  also  says  (in  A  34  —  B  51)  that  by  means  of  inner  intuition 
we  grasp  also  all  outer  intuitions  in  the  mind.  I  take  this  to  mean 
that  if  we  are  to  be  aware  of  outer  intuitions  (and  certainly  if  we  are 
to  be  aware  of  outer  objects)  we  must  be  immediately  conscious  of 
these  outer  intuitions  as  present  to  the  mind  and  so  as  events  in  our 
mental  history.  I  see  no  reason  to  take  Kant  as  meaning  that  we 
first  of  all  are  aware  of  our  inner  states  and  proceed  to  infer  spatial 
objects. 


ISO  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §  a 

would  seem  to  be  dependent  on  our  awareness  of  outer  intuitions 
as  succeeding  one  another  in  our  minds.1 

Even  so,  the  doctrine  remains  full  of  difficulties.  Kant 
appears  to  be  distinguishing,  though  by  no  means  clearly, 
the  immediately  given  content  of  outer  intuition  from  the 
objects,  namely  bodies,  to  which  the  given  content  is  referred. 
These  objects  he  certainly  regards  as  standing  in  time-relations, 
but  the  recognition  of  such  objective  time-relations  is  not  an 
immediate  intuition.  It  is  the  result  of  thinking,  which  alone 
can  distinguish  between  our  mental  changes  and  an  objective 
physical  world;  and  this  distinction  is  impossible  apart  from 
inner  sense. 

Kant's  doctrine,  if  this  interpretation  is  correct,  can  be 
understood  only  in  the  light  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
of  the  Categories.  At  present  we  can  only  note  the  reason 
given  for  the  doctrine:  time  is  the  mediate  condition  of  outer 
phenomena  because  our  ideas  of  spatial  things  are  states  of  mind, 
and  so  must  necessarily  be  in  time.2  This  seems  to  assume  that 
because  our  ideas  are  in  time,  the  objects  to  which  they  refer 
must  also  be  in  time. 

If  Kant's  argument  is  to  be  valid,  there  must  be  an  additional 
premise:  that  the  ideas  in  question  are  appearances  given  to 
sense.  If  an  appearance  is  given  to  sense,  the  immediate  presence 
of  an  object  is  involved  (as  it  is  not  when  we  are  merely  thinking). 
Hence  we  might  maintain  that  if  our  ideas  are  sensa  which  come 
in  temporal  succession,  the  objects  to  which  they  refer  must 
also  be  in  time.3 

The  'object'  in  this  argument  must  be  the  phenomenal 
object,4  since  Kant  would  definitely  reject  any  such  contention 
as  applied  to  things-in-themselves.  The  complications  in  regard 

1  Since  for  Kant  animals  have  only  outer  intuition  and  not  inner, 
they  must  presumably  have  no  consciousness  of  change.  See  Chap- 
ter LII  §  z. 

2  The  argument  is  stated  at  greater  length  in  A  34  =  B  50. 

3  The  qualities  of  these  objects  may  be  simultaneous,  although 
they  appear  successively  to  us. 

4  In  A  34  =  B  51  the  objects  are  described  as  'appearances'  or 
'objects  of  the  senses'. 


VII  §  3]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  151 

to  the  phenomenal  object  cannot  be  here  unravelled,  but  if  we 
consider  the  matter  on  a  common-sense  level,  there  is  some 
plausibility  in  Kant's  view.  All  we  know  immediately  is  the 
time  at  which  an  idea  or  sensum  is  given,  and  this  is  the  same 
as  the  time  of  our  apprehension.1  We  know  immediately,  for 
example,  the  time  at  which  we  see  a  star;2  we  do  not  know 
immediately  the  time  at  which  it  is  where  we  see  it  to  be.  Yet 
the  fact  that  we  see  it  now  implies  that  it  is,  or  was,  at  some  time. 
No  doubt,  even  as  regards  space,  we  must  distinguish 
between  the  apparent  shape  and  position  of  an  object,  which 
we  grasp  by  immediate  intuition,3  and  the  real  shape  and 
position,  which  can  be  grasped  only  by  thought.  Nevertheless 
even  the  apparent  shape  is  the  shape  of  what  is  intuited,  not 
the  shape  of  our  intuiting.  The  case  of  time  is  different :  what 
we  know  immediately  is  the  time  at  which  the  intuition  is 
given  to  us  or  becomes  a  state  of  our  mind ;  and  this  is  the 
time  not  of  what  is  intuited,  but  of  our  intuiting.4  If  this  is 
true,  time  is  properly  described  as  the  form  of  inner  sense  alone. 

§  3.  Universality  of  Space  and  Time 

The  intimate  connexion  of  space  and  time  is  not  treated 
adequately  from  the  side  of  time  any  more  than  it  is  from  the 
side  of  space.  If,  however,  we  can  accept  the  view  that  time 
is  the  immediate  condition  of  inner  appearances  and  the  mediate 
condition  of  outer  appearances,  we  have  in  the  case  of  time 
that  universality  which  is  necessary  to  Kant's  argument.  If  we 

1  Apprehension  for  Kant  involves  a  present  given  intuition;  see 
A  99;  A  120;  A  201  =  B  246.  Compare  also  A  190  =  8235.  'The 
appearances,  in  so  far  as  they  merely  qua  ideas  are  objects  of  con- 
sciousness, are  not  in  any  way  distinct  from  their  apprehension.' 
I  take  this  statement  to  refer  primarily,  if  not  entirely,  to  the  time  at 
which  appearances  are  given  and  apprehended. 

2  That  is,  the  time  at  which  its  colour  is  given  or  appears  to  us. 

3  We  need  not  deny  that  there  is  some  thought,  or  at  any  rate 
some  imagination,  in  this  case. 

4  No  doubt  the  time  of  our  intuiting,  as  we  shall  see  in  the  second 
Analogy,  may  also  be  the  time  of  what  we  intuit,  if  we  are  observing 
an  objective  change ;  but  this  we  could  never  know  by  mere  intuition. 


iS2  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §4 

can  accept  the  further  view — difficult  as  its  implications  are — 
that  outer  intuition  is  necessary  for  the  apprehension  of  states 
of  the  self  and  of  changes  in  these  states,  then  we  can  say  also 
that  space  is  the  immediate  condition  of  outer  appearances 
and  the  mediate  condition  of  inner  appearances.  This  would 
perhaps  give  us  the  required  universality  for  space  as  well.1 

On  this  view  space  and  time  (both  separately  and  together) 
would  be  the  universal  conditions  of  all  appearances  to  sense 
(whether  inner  or  outer).  All  appearances  would  be  in  one 
space  and  one  time,  or  in  one  space-time. 

§  4.  Necessity  of  Space  and  Time 

Does  the  universality  which  we  have  now  provisionally  con- 
ceded to  space  and  time  involve  also  that  necessity  which  is 
required  if  we  are  to  regard  them  as  known  a  priori^ 

We  have  to  remember  that  something  more  than  a  matter 
of  fact  (or  empirical)  universality  is  demanded.  Change,  for 
example,  is  a  universal  feature  of  everything  that  we  know, 
yet  Kant  regards  it  as  derived  from  experience,2  and  not 
deducible  from  the  idea  of  time.3 

In  a  sense  space  and  time  are  just  ultimate  facts  which  we 
cannot  go  behind.4  Kant's  own  line  of  thought  does,  however, 
suggest  the  possibility  of  finding  some  necessary  connexion 
between  them,  which  would  leave  us  with  one  ultimate  fact 
instead  of  two.  Even  apart  from  this  possibility,  he  obviously 
regards  them,  not  as  characteristics  which  we  happen  to  find 
everywhere  in  experience,  but  as  necessary  conditions  of  experi- 
ence. Space  and  time  are  a  fact,  because  experience  is  a  fact : 
but  they  are  not  merely  one  of  the  many  facts  which  we  find 
in  experience;  they  are  the  condition  of  all  the  other 
facts. 

This  problem  of  the  relation  between  the  condition  and 
the  conditioned  is  a  difficult  one,  but  Kant  is  clearly  supposing 

1  Perhaps  it  would  be  necessary  to  go  even  further  and  regard 
mental  states  as  in  some  sense  spatial.  Compare  Professor  Alexander's 
view  in  Space,  Time,  and  Deity.

that  we  understand  space  and  time  to  be  necessary  to  the 
kind  of  experience  which  human  beings  have.1 

When  we  consider  any  sensum — to  take  the  simplest  example 
— we  understand  (if  we  understand  anything)  that  it  must 
be  given  as  outside  and  beside,  and  before  and  after,  another. 
'Outside'  and  'beside'  cannot  be  reduced  to  mere  qualitative 
differences  in  the  sensum,  they  mean  'in  different  places'  or 
'in  different  parts  of  space'.  Similarly  'before*  and  'after'  cannot 
be  reduced  to  qualitative  differences  in  the  sensum,  they  mean 
'at  different  times'.2 

Space  and  time  are  ultimate,  and  cannot  be  reduced  to,  or 
derived  from,  anything  else.  Kant  is  right  in  insisting  on  this 
point,  and  it  is  quite  independent  of  any  account  of  the 
psychological  process  by  which  we  become  aware  of  space 
and  time. 

It  seems  reasonable  to  hold  that  space  and  time  are  ultimate 
and  necessary  elements  in  human  experience — we  can  conceive 
no  human  experience  without  them.  But  this  might  be  said 
equally  of  sensation.  Matter  is  just  as  necessary  to  experience 
as  form,3  and  we  can  no  more  have  experience  without  sensation 
than  we  can  have  experience  without  space  and  time.  What  is 
the  special  kind  of  necessity  which  belongs  to  space  and  time, 
and  not  to  sensation  ? 

There  is  an  important  difference  between  the  two  cases. 
We  can  indeed  say  of  sensation  a  priori  that  it  must  have  a 
degree.4  Beyond  this  we  can  say  nothing  a  priori  of  sensation : 
we  must  just  wait  for  each  sensation  till  it  is  given.  Space  and 
time,  on  the  other  hand,  are  such  that  we  can  say  what  their 
parts  must  be.  They  are,  so  to  speak,  necessary  through  and 
through,  and  there  is  nothing  in  them  which  is  not  necessary. 
We  know  not  only  that  they  must  be  in  all  experience,  but 

1  A  23  =  B  38.  2  A  30  =  B46. 

8  Compare  the  reference  to  the  material  conditions  of  experience 
(sensations)  in  A  218  =  B  266.  There  is  an  interesting  corroboration 
of  this  view  (and  of  the  inseparability  of  matter  and  form)  in  the 
Opus  Postumum.  See  Vaihinger,  Commentar,  ii,  pp.  68-9.

matter  of  experience. 


154  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §4 

what  they  must  be  in  all  experience.  This  constitutes  a  real 
difference,  which  must  not  be  exaggerated,  but  cannot  be 
denied. 

It  is  because  of  this  special  kind  of  necessity  that  Kant 
asserts  space  and  time  to  be  a  priori  ideas  or  intuitions.  We 
have  already  noted  that  the  term  'a  priori'  is  applied  by  Kant 
to  space  and  time  in  two  senses.1  We  now  see  that  the  two 
senses  are  bound  up  with  one  another.  Space  and  time  are 
known  a  priori,  firstly  as  wholes  which  necessarily  determine 
the  character  of  their  parts,  and  secondly  as  necessary  conditions 
of  experience.2  If  they  were  not  a  priori  ideas  in  the  first  sense, 
they  would  not  be  a  priori  ideas  in  the  second  sense.3 

It  is  unfortunate  that  Kant  does  not  sufficiently  distinguish, 
and  explicitly  connect,  these  two  senses,  yet  it  is  the  real 
connection  between  them  which  is  at  the  root  of  his  ambiguous 
use  of  the  term. 

The  conclusion  of  the  whole  matter  would  seem  to  be 
this.  Space  and  time  are  necessary  for  Kant  only  in  relation 
to  human  experience,  but  by  this  he  means  more  than  that 
we  have  never  had  an  experience  without  them.  He  means  also 
(i)  that  we  cannot  conceive  experience  without  them;  (2)  that 
when  we  consider  them  in  themselves  (after  eliminating  in 
thought  the  objects  with  which  they  are  filled), we  can  determine 
their  nature  through  and  through;  and  (3)  that  in  this  way  we 

1  See,  for  example,  the  meaning  of  pure  or  a  priori  intuition  in 
Chapter  IV  §  3. 

2  These  two  senses  are  bound  up  with  the  possibility  of  pure 
mathematics  and  the  possibility  of  applying  pure  mathematics  to  the 
actual  world.  In  saying  that  space  and  time  are  wholes  which  neces- 
sarily determine  the  character  of  their  parts,  I  mean  that  in  knowing 
space  and  time  as  wholes  we  know  what  their  parts  must  be.  They 
have  thus  what  may  be  called  an  internal  necessity  as  pure  intuitions ; 
and  only  so  are  we  justified  in  regarding  them  as  necessary  forms  or 
conditions  of  sensuous  intuition.  Compare  Chapter  XXX  §  5. 

3  Sensation,  although  necessary  to  experience,  is  not  (in  abstraction 
from  experience)  a  whole  which  necessarily  determines  the  character 
of  its  parts.  Hence  it  can  be  known  only  by  experience,  that  is, 
a  posteriori.  It  is  necessary  to  experience  only  as  the  matter  (the 
empirical  or  conditioned  element),  not  as  the  form  (the  a  priori  or 
conditioning  element). 


VII  §  s]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  155 

can  determine,  independently  of  experience,  the  spatial  and 
temporal  conditions  to  which  all  objects  of  experience  must 
conform.  If  we  were  living  in  the  eighteenth,  or  even  the 
nineteenth,  century,  we  should,  I  think,  have  little  justification 
for  denying  these  assumptions  of  Kant's  subsequent  argument. 

§  5.  Modern  Mathematical  Theory 

Unfortunately  for  Kant  the  development  of  modern  mathe- 
matics, and  of  modern  mathematical  theory,  casts  grave  doubt 
upon  his  assumptions  in  regard  to  geometry,  and  threatens, 
if  it  does  not  undermine,  his  position.  This  fact  can  be  dis- 
cussed profitably  only  by  those  who  possess  expert  knowledge 
of  modern  mathematical  philosophy ;  but  it  cannot  be  ignored 
without  intellectual  dishonesty,  and  some  allusion  must  be 
made  to  it,  even  at  the  risk  of  displaying  misunderstanding. 
A  lucid  and  concise  account  of  the  new  theories  is  given  by 
Professor  Stebbing  in  A  Modern  Introduction  to  Logic  1  Although 
she  there  mentions  earlier  views  of  geometry,  she  ignores 
those  of  Kant. 

According  to  the  modern  view  mathematics  now  aims  at  so 
high  a  degree  of  generality  and  abstractness  that  it  has  ceased 
to  have  any  essential  connexion  with  quantity,  and  a  fortiori 
with  space.  The  result  is  that  formal  logic,  mathematical  theory, 
and  pure  mathematics,  are  all  merged  into  an  indivisible  whole; 
and  this  whole  is  described  as  pursuing  an  analytical  method. 

It  is  not  clear  to  me  whether  this  theory  is  dealing  with  the 
same  subject,  or  using  words  in  the  same  sense,  as  Kant. 

The  logic  which  is  said  to  be  identical  with  mathematics 
is  not  the  Formal  Logic  of  Kant.  Although  it  professes  to  deal 
only  with  pure  forms  (as  did  his),  it  brings  in  what  he  would 
regard  as  matter.2  Furthermore  the  analysis  which  is  spoken 

1  See  especially  Chapter  X  §4  and  Chapter  XXIII  §  4  of  that 
work.  An  article  in  Mind,  N.S.  Vol.  XXXVIII,  No.  149,  p.  i  (January 
1929),  by  Professor  Hardy  can  also  be  consulted  with  advantage.  It 
mentions  other  theories  than  those  prevailing  in  England,  but  it  is 
hard  to  relate  to  the  Kantian  doctrine  even  those  theories  which 
insist  on  an  element  of  intuition. 

8  See  Chapter  X  §  4  of  this  book. 


1 56  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §  5 

of  is  different  from  Kant's  analysis ;  it  is  more  than  an  analysis 
of  concepts,  and  Kant  seems  to  be  right  in  denying  that 
mathematics  is  a  mere  analysis  of  concepts.  This  fact  is 
important  for  Kant's  criticism  of  metaphysics,  and  it  means 
that  mathematical  propositions  are  not  analytic  in  his 
sense.1 

Again,  the  'deductive  development*  discussed  and  created 
by  the  new  theories  is  not  primarily  a  method  of  producing 
conviction,  nor  is  it  a  method  of  discovery,2  nor  is  it  even 
important  as  a  method  of  proof.8  The  method  ot  analysis 
cannot  be  applied  at  all,  except  when  a  branch  of  mathematics 
has  already  developed  a  considerable  way.  As  Kant  is  talking 
only  of  the  method  by  which  such  a  branch  of  mathematics, 
namely  Euclidean  geometry,  has  developed,  it  is  difficult  to 
see  what  is  the  relation  between  his  statements  and  the  modern 
theories.  They  seem  to  begin  where  he  leaves  off. 

Nevertheless  we  must  assume  that  the  modern  theories  deny 
his  main  contention,  that  pure  intuition  is  necessary  for  mathe- 
matics. 'Mathematics  can  be  exhibited  as  a  completely  logical 
structure,  so  that  no  element  of  intuition  enters  into  a  mathe- 
matical proof'.4  Curiously  enough,  the  only  intuition  considered 
is  empirical  intuition,  and  the  geometry  of  which  Kant  speaks 
is  regarded  as  empirical  geometry6 — a  hard  saying,  and  one 
for  which  Miss  Stebbing  offers  no  reason. 

On  the  modern  view  a  pure  mathematical  science  is  a 
deductive  system  which  consists  of  primitive  concepts,  primi- 
tive propositions,  and  deductions  from  these.6  The  primi- 
tive concepts  are  taken  as  undefined  and  intelligible  without 
definition.  The  primitive  propositions  are  assumed  and  not 
demonstrated.7 

We  have,  however,  to  establish  the  consistency  of  our  primi- 

1  If  Mr.  Bertrand  Russell  means  to  deny  this  when  he  says  that 
mathematical  propositions  are  'tautologous  generalisations*  (Mind, 
N.S.  Vol.  XL,  No.  160,  p.  477),  the  inexpert  can  hardly  but  ask 
whether  this  assertion  is  due  to  a  special  insight  into  the  nature  of 
mathematics  or  to  a  logic  which  has  lost  its  way.

VII  §  6]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  157 

tive  propositions,  and  for  this  'interpretation*  is  necessary.1 
Indeed  apart  from  interpretation  there  can  be  no  question 
either  of  consistency  or  of  truth.2  To  interpret  the  undefined 
concepts  is  apparently  to  find  objects  for  them,3  and  indeed 
to  find  objects  which  fit  into  a  system.4 

It  is  just  this  finding  of  objects,  and  of  a  system  of  objects,5 
which  Kant  would  consider  to  require  the  intuitional  element 
necessary  both  to  the  truth  and  to  the  consistency  of  mathe- 
matics, and  fatally  lacking  in  the  metaphysics  which  he  set 
out  to  criticise. 

A  further  question  I  should  like  to  ask  is  whether  any 
system  of  objects  does  not  in  the  last  resort  involve  space  and 
time.  I  should  also  like  to  ask  whether  this  highly  abstract 
mathematics,  if  it  is  to  give  us  geometrical  conclusions,  must 
not  be  so  interpreted  that  its  objects  are  spatial  figures  which 
can,  in  Kant's  language,  be  constructed  a  priori  in  pure 
intuition. 

§  6.  Kant's  View  of  Algebra 

There  is  another  point  to  be  noted.  Hitherto  we  have  spoken 
of  geometry,  which  is  most  prominent  in  the  Aesthetic.  Kant, 
however,  believed  that  arithmetic  and  algebra  also  demanded 
intuition,  and  pure  intuition.  This  is  discussed  on  an  elementary 
level  and  in  inadequate  detail,  but  he  seems  to  be  moving  in 
the  direction  of  that  greater  abstractness  and  generality  which 
the  modern  theories  demand,  although  he  does  not  go  so  far 
as  to  escape  from  the  idea  of  quantity. 

Kant  maintains6  that  algebra  constructs  quantity  (quantitas), 
not  quanta  as  in  geometry.  It  abstracts  entirely  from  the 
character  of  the  object  which  is  to  be  thought  under  its  concept 
of  quantity,  and  chooses  a  notation  for  all  constructions  of

8  Ibid.  p.  179.  4  Ibid.  p.  207. 

5  If  they  fit  into  a  system,   I  presume  they  must  constitute  a 
system. 

6  A  717  =  B  745.  The  meaning,  and  even  the  text,  is  in  places 
uncertain.  Compare  also  Chapter  XXXVII  §  8. 


158  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §  7 

quantities1  in  general — that  is  to  say,  it  uses  signs  for  such 
operations  as  addition,  subtraction,  extraction  of  roots,  and  so 
on.  It  also  uses  signs2  for  the  different  relations  involved  in 
the  concept  of  quantities3 — I  suppose  such  signs  as  =,  <,  >. 
The  'quantities'  are  presumably  indicated  by  signs  such  as 
x,  y,  and  z,  and  perhaps  by  numerals.  Then — and  this  is  the 
point — it  exhibits  in  intuition,  in  accordance  with  certain  universal 
rules,  every  operation*  through  which  quantity  is  produced  and 
altered.  Thus  there  is  in  algebra  a  symbolical  construction,  which, 
equally  with  the  ostensive  constructions  of  geometry,  can  give 
us  results  unattainable  by  mere  analysis  of  concepts.  This 
symbolical  construction,  or  construction  by  means  of  signs,5 
also  involves  intuition. 

It  is  unfortunate  that  this  is  so  obscure.  Kant  fails  to  make 
clear  the  nature  of  the  intuition  involved — it  would  seem  to 
be  primarily  a  pure  intuition  of  time,6  and  perhaps  also  of 
space.7  I  mention  the  passage,  not  as  offering  a  satisfactory 
account  of  algebra,  but  simply  as  showing  that  for  Kant  the 
reduction  of  geometry  to  algebra  does  not  mean  that  pure 
intuition  ceases  to  be  necessary. 

§  7.  The  Necessity  of  a  priori  Construction 

I  do  not  know  whether  or  not  Kant  is  right  in  saying  that 
algebra  exhibits  its  operations  in  pure  intuition,  although  I 
think  that  his  doctrine  deserves  consideration.  If  we  set  this 

1  These  'quantities'  or  quantitates  (if  the  word  may  be  pardoned) 
are  opposed  to  quanta:  they  are  numbers  as  opposed  to  figures  or 
durations;  see  A  724  =  B  752.  2  'bezeichnet.' 

3  'The  concept  of  quantities'  is  presumably  the  same  as  the  con- 
cept of  'quantity'  or  'quantitativeness'. 

4  It  is  interesting  to  observe  that  the  modern  view  regards  the 
primitive  concepts  as  symbols  upon  which  we  operate  by  means  of 
the  primitive  propositions  (Stebbing,  p.  178). 

6  Compare  A  734  =  B  762. 

6  This  view  seems  to  rest  on  the  ground  that  counting  is  always 
successive;    see   A  142-3  =  B  182   and  Prol.   §  10   (IV  283).    Some 
qualification  of  this  is  suggested  in  a  letter  to  Schulz  of  November, 
1788  (Xs3o).  Compare  also  K.d.U.  §26  (¥251  ff.). 

7  Nachlass  6314  (XVIII  616). 


VII  §  7]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  159 

doctrine  aside,  and  consider  only  Euclidean  geometry,  it  is 
clear  that  Kant  believed  geometrical  proof  to  depend  through- 
out on  intuition  of  spatial  figures,  whereas  on  the  modern 
theory  the  intuitional  element  occurs  only  at  the  beginning, 
when  we  are  establishing  the  consistency  of  our  primitive 
propositions. 

If  we  suppose  the  modern  theory  to  give  a  true  account 
of  modern  mathematical  method,  there  is  no  reason  why  we 
should  suppose  that  it  therefore  gives  a  true  account  of  the 
method  of  Euclid.  On  the  contrary,  the  method  of  Euclid  is, 
it  seems  to  me,  explained  correctly  by  the  theory  of  Kant.1 
If  we  take  the  concept  of  triangularity,  we  can  analyse  it  till 
we  are  blue  in  the  face,  but  unless  we  construct  a  triangle  in 
intuition,  we  shall  never  advance  a  step  beyond  our  original 
definition  of  the  concept ;  we  shall  never  discover,  for  example, 
that  the  three  interior  angles  are  equal  to  two  right  angles.2 

This  does  not  mean  that  geometrical  proof  depends  upon 
empirical  intuition.  How  could  the  empirical  intuition  of  one 
triangle  give  us,  or  even  seem  to  give  us,  that  apodeictic 
certainty  which  Euclid  undoubtedly  claims  ?  We  may  be  obliged 
to  draw  a  triangle  on  paper  in  order  to  help  our  imagination, 
but  we  are  not  thinking  about  the  seen  triangle.3  We  are 
thinking  about  a  triangle  whose  characteristics  are  determined 
only  by  the  principle  of  its  construction.  In  Kant's  language 
we  are  thinking  about  a  triangle  which  we  construct  a  priori 
in  pure  intuition  in  accordance  with  the  concept.  This  language 
may  possibly  be  naive  from  the  modern  point  of  view.  It  is 
nevertheless  expressive  of  a  truth  which  may  be  in  need  of 
reinterpretation,  but  which  cannot  reasonably  be  ignored. 

1  I  believe  that  Kant's  theory  is  very  closely  akin  to  the  theory 
of  Plato.  See  Republic,  5iod,  and  compare  Aristotle,  Metaphysics, 
A  6,  9870,141!.  See  also  Adam's  edition  of  the  Republic,  Book  VII, 
Appendix  I.  2  A  716  =  B  744. 

3  Or  at  least  we  are  thinking  about  it,  not  as  a  seen  triangle, 
but  as  having  characteristics  entirely  determined  by  the  principle 
of  its  construction.  On  these  characteristics  the  whole  proof  depends. 
This  is  what  Kant  means  when  he  speaks  (A  240  =  B  299)  of  figure 
as  an  appearance  present  to  the  senses,  although  created  a  priori. 


160  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VII  §  8 

I  believe  that  the  same  doctrine  holds  in  arithmetic,  although 
there  it  is  not  so  obvious.  We  can  analyse  the  concepts  of  7  and 
of  5  and  of  addition,  but  such  analysis  will  never  teach  us 
that  7+5=12,  unless  we  construct  the  numbers  in  pure  intui- 
tion. Here  again  we  make  use  of  empirical  intuition  to  help 
us,  but  we  are  not  thinking  about  the  dots  we  put  on  paper, 
or  the  beads  on  the  counting-board,  with  all  their  irrelevant 
and  empirical  characteristics.1  We  are  thinking  about  numbers 
which  we  can  construct  a  priori  in  pure  intuition  by  adding 
unit  to  unit,  and  the  characteristics  of  these  numbers  are 
determined  only  by  the  principle  of  their  construction.2 

If  we  may  summarise  Kant's  doctrine — all  mathematical 
knowledge  depends  on  the  'construction  of  concepts',  by 
which  he  means  exhibiting  a  priori  the  intuition  corresponding 
to  the  concepts.3  For  this  purpose  we  may  use  empirical 
intuition;  for  example,  we  draw  a  triangle  on  paper.  In  so 
doing,  however,  we  consider  only  the  act  of  construction,  to 
which  much  in  the  empirical  figure  is  indifferent,  as  for  example 
the  size  of  the  sides  and  angles.  Since  we  can  abstract  from 
these,  the  individual  figures  can  express  the  concept  without 
impairing  its  universality.  Mathematics  deals  with  the  uni- 
versal as  manifested  or  expressed  in  individual  instances.4 
This  is  something  quite  different  from  a  mere  analysis  of 
concepts. 

I  am  not  unaware  of  the  fact  that  I  am  treading  upon 
treacherous  ground,  but  I  am  convinced  that  whatever  errors 
there  may  be  in  my  contention,  there  would  be  a  still  greater 
error  in  supposing  that  there  is  no  shadow  of  reason  in  the 
doctrine  of  Kant. 

§8.  Modern  Geometries 

A  still  more  serious  difficulty  for  Kant  is  the  development 
of  non-Euclidean  geometries.  Kant  himself,  when  younger,

VII  §  8]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  161 

had  flirted  with  the  idea  that  there  might  be  different  kinds 
of  space  with  other  dimensions,  and  had  connected  it  with 
Leibniz's  speculations  in  regard  to  a  plurality  of  different 
worlds.1  In  the  Kritik  he  assumes  geometry  to  be  Euclidean, 
and  assumes  also  that  Euclidean  geometry  is  necessarily  true 
of  the  physical  world. 

We  are  now  told  that  there  are  different  kinds  of  geometry 
and  different  kinds  of  space.  Such  a  view  is  not  in  itself  fatal 
to  Kant's  doctrine  that  our  knowledge  of  space  is  a  priori ; 
for  a  priori  knowledge  may  be  acquired  gradually  and  may  at 
any  stage  be  'confused'  or  'indistinct'.2  The  possibility  of  new 
mathematical  concepts  is  certainly  not  excluded  by  Kant's 
theory,3  but  on  his  suppositions  every  different  kind  of  space 
would  seem  to  imply  a  different  kind  of  pure  intuition.  This 
view  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  unless  there  can  be  one 
fundamental  intuition  of  space  (or  of  space-time)  such  that 
all  others  are  intelligible  only  in  relation  to  it.  It  is  hard  indeed 
to  believe  that  the  different  kinds  of  space  are  unconnected 
with  one  another ;  and  if  a  set  of  propositions  in  one  geometry 
can  be  replaced  by  a  different,  though  corresponding,  set  of 
propositions  in  another  geometry,  there  would  seem  to  be 
some  sort  of  underlying  unity  whose  nature  deserves  investiga- 
tion. Modern  theory,  so  far  as  I  understand  it,  denies  that  any 
one  kind  of  space  is  more  fundamental  than  any  other.  Above 
all  it  denies  that  Euclidean  space  is  more  real  or  fundamental 
than  any  other.  If  Kant's  theory  is  to  be  maintained  in  a  modern 
form,  we  should  have  to  hold  that  there  is  a  pure  intuition

2  For  example,   the  analysis  of  given  a  priori  concepts,  such  as 
categories,  may  be  'indistinct'.  The  concept  may  contain  'obscure' 
ideas  which  we  pass  over  in  our  analysis,  and  we  can  never  be  certain 
that  even  the  most  careful  analysis  of  such  concepts  is  complete.

because  they  are  'arbitrary*  inventions  (which  must,  however,  be 
compatible  with  the  nature  of  space)  and  contain  an  arbitrary  syn- 
thesis which  admits  of  a  priori  construction.  See  A  729-30  =  B  757-8,

of  space-time  in  the  light  of  which  all  the  different  geometries 
are  intelligible.1 

The  difficulty  of  defending  Kant's  doctrine  becomes  even 
more  acute,  if  only  one  of  these  geometries,  and  that  not  the 
Euclidean,  applies  to  the  actual  space  of  the  physical  world.2 
On  such  a  view  it  looks  as  if  the  application  of  geometry  to  the 
physical  world  is  a  purely  empirical  question.  Nevertheless 
even  in  that  case  one  of  the  pure  geometries  does  apply  to 
the  physical  world,  and  it  seems  to  be  assumed  that  one  of 
them  must  so  apply:8  we  appeal  to  experience  only  to  discover 
which.  If  one  of  the  many  geometries  does  apply,  and  still 
more  if  one  must  apply,  to  the  physical  world,  we  have  Kant's 
problem  before  us  in  a  more  subtle  form:  it  can  hardly  be  a 
mere  coincidence  that  some  highly  abstract  system  of  geometry 
holds  of  the  actual  world ;  and  it  is  the  duty  of  philosophy  to 
ask  for  an  explanation.  The  same  problem  would  arise  in  a  form 
still  closer  to  Kant's  assumptions,  if  what  we  may  call  physical 
space  could  be  interpreted  in  terms  of  all  the  different  geo- 
metries, even  if  one  were  very  much  more  convenient  for  the 
purpose  than  others. 

It  must  be  added  that  the  advance  of  modern  physics  involves 
changes  also  in  our  views  about  time,  but  this  does  not 
necessarily  imply  that  our  knowledge  of  time  is  empirical, 
even  although  it  is  experience  which  has  led  us  to  make  new 
discoveries.  If  the  physicist  still  presupposes  that  we  know 
something  of  what  the  parts  of  time  must  be  to  be  parts  of 
time,  or  even  that  we  know  something  of  what  the  parts  of 
space-time  must  be  to  be  parts  of  space-time;  and  if  the  philo- 
sopher can  still  say  that  all  our  ideas  must  be  either  simultaneous 
or  successive ;  then  time,  like  space,  has  still  in  some  sense  its 
doubly  a  priori  character,  and  we  need  no  more  for  the  purposes 
of  Kant's  argument. 

1  Mr.   Braithwaite  seems  to  suggest  that  there  is  one  absolute 
space-time;  see  Mind,  N.S.  Vol  XL,  No.  160,  p.  498. 

2  I  understand  that  this  view  is  no  longer  held  by  Einstein. 

8  This  need  not  mean  that  the  same  geometry  must  apply  to  every 
bit  of  space,  but  only  that  some  kind  of  geometry  must  do  so. 


VII  §  8]  KANT'S  ASSUMPTIONS  163 

Kant's  doctrine  is  altogether  too  simple  in  the  light  of 
modern  discoveries.  We  must  recognise  that  many  propositions 
which  he  (and  his  contemporaries)  were  prepared  to  assert 
a  priori  of  the  actual  world  are  definitely  untrue.  Above  all 
we  must  recognise  that  no  sufficient  account  of  space  and 
time  can  be  given,  if  we  isolate  them  from  one  another.  For 
my  own  part,  though  I  speak  as  the  merest  amateur  in  these 
matters,  I  do  not  see  why  it  should  be  impossible  to  re-state 
Kant's  assumptions  so  as  to  fit  in  with  modern  physical  doctrine. 
It  seems  to  me  at  least  possible  that  space-time  is  the  condition 
or  form  of  all  appearances  given  to  sense;  that  we  can 
gradually  sort  it  out,  by  a  special  kind  of  abstraction,  from  the 
appearances  of  which  it  is  the  form,  and  study  it  mathematically 
as  an  individual  whole  which  is  intelligible  through  and  through ; 
and  that  in  so  doing  we  can  discover  laws  to  which  the  world 
of  appearances  must  conform.  Such  suggestions  are,  however, 
hazardous  and  must  be  left  to  the  expert.  For  the  purpose  of 
understanding  Kant  we  must  place  ourselves  at  the  point  of 
view  of  the  eighteenth  century;  and  from  that  point  of  view 
I  would  urge  that  Kant's  assumptions  are,  in  the  main,  sound. 


CHAPTER    VIII 
SPACE  AND  TIME-KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS 

§  i.  The  Connexion  of  Space  and  Time  with  Sensibility 

We  must  now  assume,  for  the  purposes  of  the  argument, 
that  our  ideas  of  space  and  time  are  pure  intuitions  whose 
content  i&  the  necessary  form  of  all  appearances  given  to  sense. 
This  doctrine,  as  I  have  explained  it,  contains  nothing  to 
alarm  even  the  most  suspicious  of  realists;  yet  Kant  finds 
in  it  grounds  for  asserting  that  space  and  time  are  necessarily 
subjective  in  origin,  due  not  to  the  nature  of  things,  but  to 
the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 

There  is  no  further  argument  to  connect  space  and  time 
with  sensibility  rather  than  with  understanding.  We  must 
suppose  the  connexion  with  sensibility  to  be  established  by 
the  previous  arguments;  but  it  is  not  altogether  clear  whether 
this  connexion  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  space  and  time  are 
pure  intuitions  or  by  the  fact  that  they  are  forms  of  sensible 
appearances. 

It  may  be  maintained  that  if  space  and  time  were  connected 
with  understanding,  our  ideas  of  them  would  (like  the  categories) 
be  given  as  concepts  originally,  whereas  Kant  has  argued  that 
in  their  case  the  concept  is  derivative  and  the  intuition  original. 
If  space  and  time  are  one  and  individual,  our  knowledge  of 
them  must  be  intuitive,  and  therefore  it  must  be  sensuous; 
for  we  have  no  power  of  intellectual  intuition.1 

1  It  may  be  objected  that  intuition  normally  implies  a  real  object 
given  to  sense  by  the  'influence'  of  things-in-themselves ;  and  that 
since  pure  intuitions  imply  no  such  object,  they  might  seem  not  to 
involve  sense.  It  is  hardly  an  answer  to  this  objection,  if  we  say  that 
we  could  not  acquire  these  pure  intuitions  or  make  them  *  clear* 
to  ourselves,  unless  our  senses  were  affected;  for  the  same  is  true 
of  the  categories,  which  do  not  originate  in  sense.  Compare  A  86 
=  B  118,  A  96,  and  A  196  =  8241.  The  answer  must,  I  think,  be 
that  our  pure  intuitions  are  connected  with  sense  primarily  because 
they  contain  the  forms  of  sensible  appearances,  and  in  a  lesser 


VIII  §  2]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  165 

It  may  also  be  maintained  that  the  connexion  with  sensibility 
is  shown  by  the  fact  that  space  and  time  are  conditions  of 
objects  being  given  to  sense,  and  not  conditions  of  their  being 
thought.  We  simply  see  red  as  extended,  and  so  as  spatial, 
while  we  think  that  it  is  a  quality  of  a  substance.  Similarly  we 
are  immediately  aware  of  sensa  as  before  and  after,  while  we 
think  that  events  are  connected  as  cause  and  effect. 

There  is  no  reason  why  we  should  not  regard  both  these 
grounds  as  establishing  the  connexion  of  space  and  time  with 
sensibility.  We  should  have  been  grateful  to  Kant,  if  he  had 
given  a  fuller  treatment  to  this  question,  but  on  the  whole 
he  seems  to  have  a  good  case.  If  space  and  time  are  to  be 
regarded  as  subjective  in  origin,  it  is  reasonable  to  find  their 
origin  in  sensibility  rather  than  in  understanding. 

§  2.  The  Subjectivity  of  Space  and  Time 

What  are  we  to  say  of  Kant's  more  fundamental  doctrine 
that  because  space  and  time  are  known  a  priori,  they  must 
have  a  subjective  origin? 

In  the  first  place  we  must  be  clear  what  the  doctrine  means. 
It  does  not  mean  that  space  and  time  are  mental;  for  space 
at  least  is  a  predicate,  not  of  the  mind,  but  of  things  as  they 
appear  to  us,  that  is,  of  objects  of  sensibility.1  Even  time  is 
a  condition  of  all  appearances  (inner  and  outer),  and  whatever 
Kant  may  mean  by  saying  that  it  is  not  a  determination  of 
outer  appearances,2  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  for  him  all 
objects  of  the  senses  must  be  in  time.3  The  objects  of  the 
senses  are,  in  his  view,  appearances  of  things  whose  character 
and  existence  is  entirely  independent  of  the  nature  of  our 
minds.  None  the  less  the  spatial  and  temporal  characteristics 

degree  because  only  sense  can  give  us  what  is  individual.  The  reason 
why  pure  intuition  has  no  real  object  is  simply  that  its  content  is  the 
form,  not  the  matter,  of  given  appearances. 

1  A  27  =  B  43.  When  Kant  speaks  of  space  as  a  predicate,  he  must 
mean  the  general  concept  of  spatiality.

166  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  2 

of  sensible  objects  belong  (so  far  as  we  know)  only  to  the 
things  as  they  appear  to  us,  not  to  them  as  they  are  in  them- 
selves. We  human  beings  cannot  apprehend  things  except  as 
spatial  and  temporal,  but  we  have  no  reason  to  believe  that 
the  things  as  they  are  in  themselves  are  either  spatial  or 
temporal;  for  space  and  time  are  imposed  on  appearances 
by  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 

It  is  impossible  to  invent  any  exact  parallel  for  this  revolu- 
tionary doctrine,  but  if  we  looked  at  everything  through  blue 
spectacles,  we  could  say  that  the  blueness  of  things,  as  they 
appeared  to  us,  was  due,  not  to  the  things,  but  to  our  spectacles. 
In  that  case  the  spectacles  offer  a  very  rough  analogy  to  human 
sensibility  in  Kant's  doctrine.1 

In  the  second  place  we  must  be  clear  about  the  nature  of 
Kant's  argument.  His  argument  does  not  rest  merely  on  the 
ground  that  we  cannot  conceive  any  experience  except  as 
spatial  and  temporal.  It  rests  on  what  I  have  called  the  doubly 
a  priori  character  of  our  ideas  of  space  and  time.  Its  ground 
is  (i)  that  we  can  determine  the  nature  of  space  and  time 
through  and  through  independently  of  experience;  and  (2) 
that  in  this  way  we  can  determine,  independently  of  experi- 
ence, the  spatial  and  temporal  conditions  to  which  all  objects 
of  experience  must  conform.2 

Kant's  contention — however  unplausible  it  may  seem  at 
first  sight — is  that  if  things  appeared  to  us  just  as  they  are  in 
themselves,  we  could  not  legislate  for  them  independently  of 
experience.  We  could  recognise  that,  so  far  as  we  had  experi- 
enced them,  they  possessed  certain  characteristics,  and  we 
might  anticipate  that  they  would  continue  to  do  so.  We  could 

1  It  may  be  noted  incidentally  that  although  the  blueness  of  things 
would  be  imposed  by  our  spectacles,  (i)  we  should  not  first  of  all 
see  things  as  non-blue,  and  then  see  them  as  blue ;  and  (2)  the  differ- 
ences in  the  shades  of  blueness  would  be  due,  not  to  our  spectacles, 
but  to  things.  These  obvious  facts  may  perhaps  help  to  make  clearer 
my  contentions  in  regard  to  form  and  matter — see  Chapter  VI  §  8. 

2  Compare  Chapter  VI  §  5.  All  this  is  implied  in  the  statement 
that  space  and  time  are  pure  intuitions  whose  content  is  the  necessary 
form  of  appearances. 


VIII  §2]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  167 

say,  for  example,  that  every  triangle  hitherto  measured  had 
its  interior  angles  equal  to  two  right  angles;  and  we  might 
expect  other  triangles  to  have  the  same  characteristic,  just  as 
we  might  expect  any  swan  we  see  to  be  white.  But  we  could 
not  assert  that  the  interior  angles  of  every  triangle  must  be 
equal  to  two  right  angles,  and  that  this  law  must  necessarily 
apply  to  every  triangle  that  we  see.  Still  less  could  we  work 
out  a  necessary  system  of  geometry  to  which  all  experienced 
objects  must  conform. 

If  we  can  determine  the  nature  of  space  and  time  indepen- 
dently of  experience  and  thereby  legislate  for  all  possible 
objects  of  experience,  this  can  only  be  (according  to  Kant) 
because  space  and  time  are  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 
No  other  explanation  can  account  for  the  fact  that  our  abstract 
knowledge  of  space  and  time  possesses  apodeictic  certainty 
and  also  applies  to  all  objects  of  experience.  Kant's  theory  is 
not  merely  possible  or  probable.  It  claims  to  be  absolutely 
certain.1 

If  space  and  time  are  due  entirely  to  the  nature  of  our 
sensibility,  it  is  obvious  that  we  can  have  no  ground  for  sug- 
gesting that  nevertheless  they  might  also  belong  to  things  as 
they  are  in  themselves.  It  is  equally  obvious  that  the  empirical 
qualities  revealed  in  our  sensa,  although  they  are  due  to  the 
'influence'  of  independent  things,  cannot  be  qualities  of  these 
things  as  they  are  in  themselves ;  for  such  empirical  qualities 
are  necessarily  spatial  and  temporal.2  Indeed  the  latter  point 
is  hardly  in  need  of  argument,  since  the  sensa  vary  from  indivi- 
dual to  individual  (as  the  spatial  and  temporal  characteristics 
when  scientifically  determined  do  not).  This  means  that  they 
depend  partly  upon  something  other  than  the  thing  of  which 
they  are  the  appearances.3 

1  A  48-9  =  B  66. 

2  It  seems  meaningless  to  say  that  a  thing-in-itself  has  a  colour 
which  neither  extends  through  space  nor  lasts  through  time. 

3  According  to  Kant,  as  I  understand  him,  although  differences 
in  the  secondary  qualities  (and  also  in  shapes,  sizes,  and  durations) 
depend  on  the  nature  of  things-in-themselves,  this  does  not  imply 


168  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  3 

§  3.  A  Rough  Analogy 

The  precise  character  of  Kant's  view  of  space  and  time 
may  perhaps  be  made  clearer  by  contrasting  it  with  the  rough 
analogy  of  the  blue  spectacles  suggested  above.  Suppose  we 
were  all  born  with  something  like  blue  spectacles  on  our  eyes, 
how — it  may  be  asked — could  we  determine  whether  the  blue- 
ness  of  things  really  belonged  to  things-in-themselves  or  not  ? 

We  must  assume  for  this  purpose  that  our  only  sense  is 
sight,  so  that  the  blueness  of  things  is  as  universal  as  their 
spatial  and  temporal  characteristics.  We  must  also  assume  that 
it  would  be  as  impossible  for  us  to  imagine  an  object  which 
was  not  some  shade  of  blue  as  it  is  to  imagine  an  object  which 
does  not  occupy  some  space  and  last  for  some  time.  So  far 
the  cases  are  parallel,  but  there  is  nevertheless  a  fundamental 
difference  between  them. 

We  could  recognise  blueness  as  a  common  characteristic  of 
all  experienced  objects ;  that  is  to  say,  we  could  have  a  concept 
of  blueness:  but  if  we  had  such  a  concept,  what  more  could 
we  do  with  it  ?  There  is  no  way  of  studying  the  necessary  laws 
of  blueness  in  abstraction,  and  thereby  determining  a  priori 
the  character  of  all  possible  objects.1  Hence  we  could  never 
have  any  ground  for  deciding  whether  blueness  belonged  to 
things  in  themselves  or  depended  on  the  nature  of  our  eyes. 

that  we  have  knowledge  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.  It  implies 
only  that  we  have  knowledge  of  things  as  they  appear  to  us. 

We  might  indeed  object  that  differences  and  likenesses  in  appear- 
ances must  imply  some  sort  of  differences  and  likenesses  in  the 
thing,  or  things,  that  appear;  but  we  have  no  means  of  knowing  the 
respect  in  which  things-in-themselves,  or  their  qualities,  differ  from, 
or  resemble,  one  another.  We  do  not  even  know  that  there  is  a 
plurality  of  such  things,  or  that  things-in-themselves  can  have 
qualities,  although  we  must  think  of  them,  by  analogy,  as  a  plurality 
and  as  having  qualities.  In  such  circumstances  a  statement  of  their 
differences  and  likenesses  is  too  vague  to  convey  positive  meaning. 

1  We  might  indeed  determine  that  the  degrees  of  blueness  are 
necessarily  continuous,  and  that  every  object  must  have  a  degree  of 
blueness.  But  in  that  case  Kant  holds,  consistently,  that  the  degree- 
ness  (though  not  the  blueness)  must  be  imposed  a  priori  by  the 
nature  of  the  mind.  See  the  Anticipations  of  Sense-Perception. 


VIII  §4]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  169 

This  point  may  be  put  in  another  way.  By  abstraction  we 
could  think  the  concept  of  blueness,  but  we  could  never 
intuit  the  one  infinite  blue  of  which  all  blues  are  necessarily 
parts;  yet  unless  we  can  do  so,  blue  is  not  really  analogous 
to  space.  Or  if  it  be  supposed  that  we  could  intuit  the  one 
infinite  blue  (on  the  ground  that  the  only  objection  to  this 
is  the  difficulty  of  intuiting  the  infinite,  a  difficulty  which 
applies  equally  to  space),  then  the  intuition  would  be  empirical. 
We  could  see  no  necessity  why  every  blue  area  as  such  should 
be  a  part  of  a  wider  blue  area.  We  could  indeed  see  the  necessity 
why  every  area  should  be  part  of  a  wider  area,  but  this  would 
have  nothing  to  do  with  its  blueness.1  Our  intuition  of  space 
would  still  be  a  priori,  we  could  still  determine  the  laws  of 
space  independently  of  experience,  and  thereby  determine  the 
laws  governing  all  sensible  objects.  The  intuition  of  blue  would 
give  us  no  such  power,  and  we  should  have  no  sufficient 
ground  for  attributing  it  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 

The  status  of  space  and  time  in  experience  is  unique,  and 
it  is  because  of  this  unique  status  that  Kant  holds  they  must 
be  attributed  to  the  nature  of  the  mind. 

§  4.  Subjectivity  and  Knowledge  of  Necessity 

Kant's  Copernican  revolution  is  intended  to  account  for  a 
necessity  which  we  are  assumed  to  know — the  necessity  that 
objects  of  experience  should  conform  to  the  mathematical  laws 
of  time  and  space.  Is  it  intended  also  to  account  for  our  know- 
ledge of  this  necessity  ? 

At  first  sight  it  would  seem  that  there  is  no  such  intention, 
in  the  case  of  the  categories  Kant  does  indeed  believe  that 
by  tracing  them  to  their  origin  in  the  human  understanding 
we  make  it  possible  to  know  what  the  categories  must  be. 
What  reason  produces  entirely  out  of  itself  cannot  be  concealed,2 
and  the  'clue'  to  the  categories  is  to  be  found  in  the  forms  of 

1  The  same  criticism  would  apply  to  any  argument  that  force, 
matter,  or  reality  (which  are  supposed  to  fill  the  whole  of  space) 
must  be  known  through  pure  intuition  in  the  same  way  as  space  itself.

judgement  which  are  known  a  priori  in  Formal  Logic.  Never- 
theless Kant  does  not  regard  the  human  mind  as  transparent 
in  itself,  or  as  more  easily  understood  than  the  physical  world.1 
He  certainly  does  not  believe  our  sensibility  to  be  so  transparent 
to  reflexion  that  we  can  understand  why  it  must  involve  the 
two  factors  of  space  and  time.* 

There  is,  however,  a  sense  in  which  the  Critical  doctrine 
is  put  forward  to  explain  our  knowledge  of  necessity,  and  not 
merely  to  explain  the  necessity  which  we  know.  Kant,  as  I 
have  insisted,  is  not  arguing  only  that  if  space  and  time  are 
due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility,  this  would  explain  why 
all  objects  must  be  spatial  and  temporal.  Such  a  hypothesis 
would  explain  the  assumed  facts,  but  it  could  hardly  be  put 
forward  as  the  only  possible  hypothesis.3  The  two-fold 
character  of  the  argument  ought  never  to  be  overlooked. 
What  Kant  is  attempting  to  explain  is  why  our  abstract  know- 
ledge of  the  necessary  characteristics  of  pure  space  and  time 
should  be  also  a  knowledge  of  the  laws  to  which  objects  of 
sense  must  conform.  His  contention  is  that  such  know- 
ledge is  possible  only  if  the  pure  intuition  by  which  we 
know  space  and  time  is  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility 
alone.4 

It  can  hardly  be  denied  that  Kant's  doctrine  offers  a  possible 
explanation  of  the  facts,  if  we  assume  that  these  facts  are

(IV  280)),  and  the  schematism  of  the  understanding  (A  141  =  B  180-1) 
are  hidden  deep  in  the  human  mind.    Imagination  is  said  to  be  a 
blind  but  indispensable  function  of  the  soul  of  which  we  are  seldom 
conscious  (A  78  =  B  103).  Compare  also  A  834  =  B  862. 

2  Compare  B  146.  In  this  passage  Kant  appears  even  to  deny  that 
we  understand  why  we  must  judge  only  through  certain  forms  of 
judgement.  This  seems  to  be  an  overstatement  of  his  case,  but  we 
have  certainly  no  means  of  knowing  the  nature  of  our  sensibility 
except  by  knowing  the  nature  of  its  objects.  Compare  Fortschritte 
der  Metaphysik  (Phil.  Bib.  46c,  p.  92). 

8  It  would  be  parallel  to  the  contention  that  a  universal  blueness 
must  be  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.

established  by  the  previous  Expositions,  and  in  particular  by 
the  Metaphysical  Exposition.  The  question  to  be  decided  is 
whether  it  offers  the  only  possible  explanation. 

§  5.  The  Arguments  against  Leibniz  and  Newton 

The  arguments  by  which  Kant  seeks  to  justify  his  'Con- 
clusions' consist  largely  of  objections  to  the  theories  of  Leibniz 
and  Newton.  This  is  natural  enough,  since  his  business  is 
to  dispose  of  alternative  explanations;  but  there  is  always  a 
danger,  in  this  kind  of  argument,  that  some  other  real  possi- 
bility may  be  overlooked. 

Kant  claims  that  if  the  doctrines  he  has  set  forth  in  the 
Expositions  are  true,  they  are  incompatible  with  any  doctrine 
of  the  Leibnizian  type.  If  space  and  time  are  forms  or  conditions 
of  appearances ,  and  so  of  sensible  objects,  they  cannot  be 
mere  characteristics1  (whether  qualities  or  relations)  of  such 
objects ;  for  the  object — at  any  rate  if  it  is  regarded  as  a  thing-in- 
itself — is  logically  prior  to  its  characteristics.2  And  if  our  ideas 
of  space  and  time  are  'originally'  pure  intuitions,  they  cannot 
be  reduced  to  mere  concepts  (whether  distinct  or  indistinct) 
of  the  common  characteristics  of  things-in-themselves.3 

These  two  arguments  are  not  unconnected  any  more  than 
the  assumptions  on  which  they  rest  are  unconnected.  Kant's 
entire  theory  rests  on  the  view  that  while  we  cannot  know 
appearances  apart  from  space  and  time,  we  can  know  space 
and  time  independently  of  experience,  as  wholes  which  neces- 

1  * Bestimmungen.'  These  may  be  taken  to  cover  both  qualities  and 
relations  as  in  A  26  =  B  42,  where  qualities  are  referred  to  as  absolute, 
and  relations  as  relative,  characteristics  (or  determinations). 

2  See  A  26  =  B  42  and  A  33  =  B  49.  For  the  parenthesis,  see  also 
A  267  =  B  323  and  compare  A  276  =  B  332. 

8  This  argument  is  put  less  clearly  in  the  'Conclusions*.  Kant 
insists  merely  that  the  characteristics  of  things,  inasmuch  as  they 
are  essentially  dependent  upon  things,  cannot  be  intuited  a  priori. 
We  can  conceive  such  characteristics  only  by  an  abstraction  from 
empirical  intuitions.  For  the  argument  against  making  the  difference 
between  the  sensible  and  the  intelligible  a  logical  difference  between 
the  distinct  and  the  indistinct,  see  A  43  =  B  60  ff. 


172  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  5 

sarily  determine  the  nature  of  their  parts.1  This  is  the  ground 
of  his  contention  that  space  and  time  (i)  are  the  form,  not 
the  matter,  of  appearances,2  and  (2)  are  known  by  pure  intuition. 
It  is  also  the  ultimate  ground  of  his  contention  that  space 
and  time  (i)  cannot  be  mere  characteristics  of  things,  and  (2) 
cannot  be  known  by  mere  conception. 

Furthermore,  if  Kant  is  right  in  holding  that  the  judge- 
ments of  geometry  are  synthetic  a  priori  judgements,  space 
and  time  must  be  known  by  pure  intuition :  the  mere  analysis 
of  concepts — and  we  can  do  nothing  with  concepts  except 
analyse  them — could  never  give  us  such  judgements. 

I  must  confess  that  I  find  it  extremely  difficult  to  estimate 
the  force  of  these  arguments.  Kant  seems  to  me  to  be  altogether 
sound  in  denying  that  intuitions,  whether  empirical  or  pure, 
can  be  reduced  to  indistinct  concepts.  I  believe  he  is  also  sound 
in  maintaining  that  our  knowledge  of  space  and  time  is  primarily 
intuitional  and  not  conceptual,  and  that  we  cannot  regard  the 
spatial  and  temporal  characteristics  of  objects  as  on  an  equal 
footing  with  other  characteristics.3  But  the  question  arises 
whether  we  cannot  abstract  from  observed  objects  the  system 
(or  systems)  of  relations  in  which  they  stand,  and  discover 
in  such  a  system  a  necessity  which  must  govern  all  objects 
standing  in  these  relations.  Or  rather — since  it  is  Kant's  conten- 
tion that  we  can  do  this  in  the  case  of  space  and  time — why 
should  we  maintain  that  such  knowledge  of  necessity  is  intelli- 
gible only  on  the  supposition  that  the  system  of  relations  must 
itself  be  imposed  on  objects  by  the  mind  which  knows  them  ? 

The  question  is  the  more  pressing  because  modern  logic, 
as  I  understand  it,  claims  to  abstract  various  systems  of  relation 
and  to  find  in  them  a  necessity  which  gives  us  a  priori  know- 
ledge of  all  objects  standing  in  these  relations.  Spatial  and 
temporal  relations  then  become  only  a  species  of  a  more 

1  By  this  I  mean  that  we  know  the  parts  only  as  limitations  of 
the  whole,  and  that  knowing  the  whole  we  know  what  the  parts 
must  be.  2  See  Chapter  VII  §  4. 

8  The  spatial  and  temporal  characteristics  seem  to  be  relational 
characteristics  and  therefore  so  far  distinct  from  qualities. 


VIII  §  5]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  173 

abstract  system  of  relations  which  can  be  dealt  with  adequately 
and  sufficiently  by  formal  logic.  Unless  we  hold  that  all  relations 
as  such  must  be  imposed  by  the  mind — and  I  do  not  think 
this  is  Kant's  position — why  should  not  spatial  and  temporal 
relations  be  real  relations  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves  ? 
Why  should  we  not  be  content  to  recognise  that,  granted 
certain  relations,  we  can  grasp  a  necessity  in  them  as  we  cannot 
in  mere  qualities?  And  why  should  we  seek  to  explain  our 
knowledge  of  this  necessity  on  the  ground  that  whatever  con- 
tains this  necessity  must  be  imposed  by  the  mind  ? 

To  deal  with  these  questions  adequately  would  take  me  far 
beyond  the  limited  purposes  of  this  book.  I  would  only  say, 
provisionally,  that  I  think  Kant's  doctrine  has  to  be  accepted 
or  rejected  in  the  light  of  the  answer  to  these  wider  questions. 
This  means  definitely  that,  taken  in  themselves,  his  arguments 
are  not  so  conclusive  as  he  imagines.  Nevertheless  I  am  inclined 
to  suspect,  though  I  recognise  this  may  be  due  to  ignorance, 
that  space  and  time  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  logical  system 
of  relations.1  They  look  to  me  like  individual  wholes  which 
are  known  by  pure  intuition,  and  this  pure  intuition  seems 
to  me,  as  it  did  to  Kant,  to  underlie  all  our  concepts  of  the 
relations  which  they  contain.  I  am  also  inclined  to  suspect 
that  space  and  time  have  a  unique  status  in  our  experience, 
and  that  we  shall  make  no  progress  in  our  philosophy  till  this 
essentially  Kantian  doctrine  is  recognised. 

Kant  is  attempting  to  do  justice  to  this  unique  nature  of 
space  and  time,  and  only  by  recognising  this  can  we  appreciate 
his  theory.  He  maintains  that  Leibniz  failed  to  account  for 
the  essential  individuality  of  space  and  time.  We  have  no 
business  to  explain  this  away;  and  the  only  way  in  which  we 
can  uphold  this  essential  individuality  is  to  regard  space  and 

1  If,  for  example,  we  say  that  in  an  army  there  are  various  relations 
of  subordination  and  co-ordination,  then  (setting  aside  the  point 
that  such  relations  always  presuppose  space)  it  is  quite  untrue  to 
say  that  ordination  stands  to  subordination  and  co-ordination  as 
space  stands  to  left  and  right  or  up  and  down.  Ordination  is  merely 
a  concept  of  common  characteristics:  space  is  an  individual  whole 
within  which  alone  certain  relations  are  possible. 


174  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  5 

time  as  individual  wholes  given  to  the  mind  (on  the  occasion 
of  sense-perceptions)  through  the  nature  of  our  own  sensi- 
bility. The  alternative  is  to  treat  space  and  time  as  things-in- 
themselves,  and  this  Newtonian  doctrine  Kant  believes  to  be 
inconceivable. 

When  we  turn  to  Kant's  treatment  of  Newton,  the  funda- 
mental question  we  must  ask  seems  to  be  this :  Granting  that 
by  means  of  our  pure  intuitions  of  space  and  time  we  can 
know  a  priori  the  conditions,  or  forms,  of  all  appearances, 
why  should  not  space  and  time  be  real  things  which  are  at 
the  same  time  conditions,  or  forms,  of  things,  not  only  as  they 
appear  to  us,  but  as  they  are  in  themselves  ? 

It  is  a  weakness  in  Kant's  argument  that  he  pays  too  little 
attention  to  this  possibility.  If  we  set  aside  the  theological 
objection — that  such  a  view  makes  space  and  time  the  condition 
of  God's  existence1 — we  are  left  with  the  plea  that  the  theory 
is  inconceivable,  inasmuch  as  it  is  self-contradictory.2  When 
Kant  asserts  that  on  the  Newtonian  hypothesis  space  and  time 
are  nonentities  (Undinge),  he  implies  that  the  very  concept 
of  them  contradicts  itself.3  He  appears  to  consider  this  so 
obvious  that  it  needs  no  argument  in  its  defence.  He  may 
mean  that  space  and  time,  taken  as  things,  have  the  contra- 
dictory character  of  being  systems  of  relations  which  relate 
nothing;4  or  he  may  find  their  contradictory  character  in  the 
puzzles  connected  with  infinity  which  are  dealt  with  in  the 
first  two  Antinomies. 

The  Newtonian  idea  of  absolute  space  and  time  is  now 
generally  abandoned,  so  that  perhaps  we  need  not  be  greatly 

1  This  seems  to  assume  the  strict  universality  of  space. 

2  The  most  important  passages  are  A  39-40  =  B  56-7  and  B  70-1. 
The  former  passage  is  quoted  in  Chapter  VI  §  4.  The  latter  passage 
maintains  that  on  this  view  space  and  time  must  be  two  infinite 
things  which  are  not  substances,  but  which  are  also  not  anything 
which  really  inheres  in  substances  (as  a  common  quality  or  relation- 
ship), yet  which  exist,  and  are  the  necessary  condition  of  the  existence 
of  all  things,  although  they  remain  over  when  all  existing  things  are 
cancelled  or  annulled  (aufgehoben).  Compare  also  A  32  =  B  49  and 
A  292  =  B  348.  8  A  292  =  B  348.

VIII  §  6]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  175 

perturbed  by  the  slightness  of  Kant's  argument  against  it.  It 
might,  however,  be  replaced  by  a  hypothesis  of  the  same  type: 
namely,  that  space-time,  although  not  absolute  in  the  Newtonian 
sense,  is  nevertheless  a  real  thing ;  and  that  the  contradictions 
which  Kant  finds  in  the  idea  of  space  and  time  as  real  things 
are  due  to  the  treatment  of  space  and  time  in  isolation  from 
one  another,  and  therefore  can  be  set  aside.1  If  any  such 
hypothesis  could  be  maintained,  it  would  undermine  Kant's 
whole  position. 

Kant  is  in  any  case  justified  in  saying  to  his  opponents 
that  they  must  think  out  clearly  the  doctrine  which  they  put 
forward  as  an  alternative  to  his.  They  must  make  up  their 
minds  whether  space  and  time  are  to  be  regarded  as  self- 
existent  entities,  or  whether  they  are  merely  the  common 
qualities  (relational  or  otherwise)  of  such  entities ;  it  is  illegiti- 
mate to  regard  them  now  in  one  way  and  now  in  another, 
or  to  hover  vaguely  between  both  possibilities  without  commit- 
ting oneself  to  either.  And  if  our  only  choice  lay  between  the 
doctrines  of  Kant  and  those  of  Newton  or  Leibniz,  the  doctrines 
of  Kant  would  have  a  very  strong  claim  upon  our  suffrage. 

Nevertheless  so  far  as  Kant's  argument  rests  upon  the  alleged 
impossibility  of  all  other  views,  it  must  remain  inconclusive, 
unless  we  are  certain  that  the  views  examined  are  exhaustive. 
Negative  evidence  of  this  kind  is  a  corroboration  rather  than 
a  proof.  What  are  we  to  say  of  the  positive  claims  of  Kant's 
doctrine  itself?  Do  these  hold  independently  of  the  view  that 
the  concept  of  space  and  time  as  real  things  is  self-contradictory  ? 

§  6.  The  Theory  of  Kant 

Kant  habitually  speaks  as  if  his  theory — that  space  and 
time  are  subjective  in  origin — followed  inevitably  from  the 
doctrines  established  in  the  Expositions,  and  as  if  no  other 
theory  were  compatible  with  these  doctrines.  It  is  not  easy  to 
see  why  this  should  be  so,  unless  we  hold  that  every  theory 
of  the  Newtonian  type  is  excluded  as  in  itself  too  ridiculous 

1  This  view  is,  I  think,  the  view  of  Professor  Alexander. 


176  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  6 

for  serious  consideration.1  If  we  do  hold  this,  Kant's  contention 
becomes  much  more  obvious ;  and  I  am  inclined  to  think  that 
a  supposition  of  this  kind,  though  generally  not  made  explicit, 
is  always  present  in  his  arguments  for  the  subjectivity  of  space 
and  time.2 

So  far  as  I  can  discover,  Kant  nowhere  asserts  that  the 
Newtonian  doctrine  is  incompatible  with  the  Metaphysical 
and  Transcendental  Expositions.  He  apparently  admits  that 
if  space  and  time  were  real  things,  our  knowledge  of  space 
and  time  would  be  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects  in  space  and 
time.3  This  may  mean  that  the  Newtonian  theory  is  compatible 
both  with  the  existence  of  pure  mathematics  and  with  its 
applicability  to  the  physical  world;4  and  if  so,  it  would  also 
be  compatible  with  the  doctrine  of  the  Expositions. 

If  we  accept  this  conclusion,5  Kant's  whole  argument  against 
Newton  rests  on  the  inconceivability  of  space  and  time  as 
real  things ;  and  his  claim — that  only  by  the  Copernican  revolu- 
tion can  the  doctrines  of  the  Expositions  be  rendered  intelligible 
— is  directed  solely  against  the  philosophical  theories  of  Leibniz, 
which  at  that  time  were  dominant  in  Germany. 

When  Kant  is  understood  in  this  way,  the  argument  becomes 
much  more  plausible.  Space  and  time  cannot  be  real  things, 

1  'pertinet  ad  mundum  fabulosum.'  See  Diss.  §  15  D  (II  404). 

2  I  think,  for  example,  that  it  may  be  present  in  B  41. 

3  In  A  40  =  B  57  Kant  says  that  the  supporters  of  the  Newtonian 
hypothesis  open  up  (freimachen)  the  field  of  appearances  for  mathe- 
matical propositions  (Behauptungen).  I  take  this  to  mean  that  they 
can  account  for  the  possibility  of  the  application  of  mathematics  to 
actual  things.  (The  word  'freimachen*  is  also  used  for  'franking'  letters, 
which  I  suppose  means  making  them  free  of  the  post.) 

4  Such  an  interpretation  seems  to  me  to  be  supported,  at  least  by 
implication,  in  Diss.  §  15  D  (II  404). 

5  Kant  can  hardly  believe  that  on  the  Newtonian   view  mathe- 
matical knowledge,  although  a  priori  in  relation  to  physical  things, 
would  in  itself  be  empirical.  He  suggests,  rather  curiously,  in  the 
Fortschritte  der  Metaphysik  (Phil.  Bib.  460,  p.  91),  that  if  space  were 
the  form  of  the  object  as  it  is  in  itself,  we  should  have  to  know  it 
by  an  empirical  a  priori  intuition ;  and  (on  p.  93)  that  our  synthetic 
a  priori  judgements  would  be  empirical  and  contingent,   which    is 
self-contradictory. 


VIII  §  6]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  177 

or  independent  substances,  for  this  is  inconceivable  and  self- 
contradictory  :  but  equally  they  cannot  be  qualities  or  relations 
of  real  things ;  for  if  they  were,  they  would  be  dependent  upon 
the  things,  whereas  we  have  seen  that  the  things  are  dependent 
upon  them.  If  we  regard  them  as  due  to  the  nature  of  our 
sensibility,  their  inconceivability  or  self-contradiction  is  sup- 
posed to  disappear;  and  it  at  once  becomes  intelligible  how, 
although  they  can  be  known  in  abstraction  from  objects,  they 
can  nevertheless  be  the  condition  of  objects — provided  always 
that  such  objects  are  things  as  they  appear,  and  must  appear, 
to  our  sensibility,  not  things  as  they  are  in  themselves. 

This  interpretation  has  the  further  merit  that  it  gives  us 
an  argument  from  the  logical  priority,  and  not  from  the 
temporal  priority,  of  our  knowledge  of  space  and  time.  As 
I  have  said,  I  think  it  rash  to  affirm  that  Kant  ever  confused 
logical  and  temporal  priority;1  and  I  do  not  believe  that  we 
need  attribute  to  him  anything  so  crude  even  in  the  Aesthetic, 
where  his  terminology  is  unhappily  applied  without  explicit 
repudiation  of  a  temporal  meaning.2  But  even  if  we  are  convinced 
by  the  arguments,  so  strongly  urged  by  Professor  Prichard,3 
which  attribute  this  confusion  to  Kant,  it  is  all-important  to 
decide  whether  Kant's  reasoning  rests  entirely  upon  this  con- 

1  Chapter  III  §  3. 

2  Compare  Chapter  VI  §  7.  It  is  important  to  notice,  not  only  that 
Kant  expressly  repudiates   this   doctrine  of  temporal  priority  else- 
where, but  also  that  in  works  like  the  Dissertation  and  the  Streitschrift 
where  such  repudiation  is  found,  he  continues  to  use  expressions  like 
'before*   and   'precedes',   which  suggest  a   temporal  interpretation. 
Professor  Prichard  relies  primarily  on  the  Prolegomena,  and  it  should 
be  noted  how  in  §  10  of  that  work  Kant  argues  that  because  space 
and  time  remain  over  when  we  eliminate  the  empirical  element,  they 
are  therefore  pure  intuitions,  and  therefore  forms  of  sensibility  which 
must  precede  all  empirical  intuition.  The  same  combination  of  remain- 
ing over  and  so  preceding  is  also  to  be  found  in  the  Streitschrift 
(VIII  240),  and  it  suggests  that  to  'precede*  does  not  mean  to  'precede 
in  time*.  Compare  also  Anthr.  §  7  Anmerk.  (VII  141) :  'The  formal 
constitution  of  this  receptivity  cannot  be  borrowed  from  the  senses, 
but  must  (as  intuition)  be  given  a  priori,  that  is,  it  must  be  a  sensuous 
intuition  which  remains  over  if  everything  empirical ...  is  eliminated.'

fusion,  or  whether  his  thought  contains  a  deeper  and  more 
legitimate  contention.  For  my  own  part  I  have  no  doubt  what- 
ever that  it  does;  and  it  is  this  more  legitimate  contention 
which  alone  has  any  claim  upon  our  consideration. 

§  7.  Human  Experience 

Kant's  arguments  apply  only  to  human  experience,  and  he 
regards  as  conceivable  a  knowledge  which  depends,  not  on 
sensuous,  but  on  intellectual,  intuition.1 

Intellectual  intuition  would  not,  like  sensuous  intuition, 
depend  on  objects  given  to  it  from  without:  its  objects  would 
be  given,  or  produced,2  by  the  very  act  of  intuition  itself. 
Of  such  an  intellectual  intuition  space  and  time  would  not  be 
forms.  They  are  forms  of  sensuous  intuition  alone.  Hence  if 
we  conceive  the  divine  mind  as  possessing  intellectual  intuition, 
the  divine  experience,  if  it  can  be  called  experience,  would 
not  be  spatial  or  temporal. 

Furthermore  there  might  be  other  limited  and  dependent 
beings  like  ourselves  whose  experience  was  sensuous,  but  whose 
senses  might  be  different  from  ours.3  For  such  beings  space 
and  time  might  or  might  not  be  the  necessary  forms  of  their 
sensuous  intuitions.  In  this  respect  space  and  time  differ  from 
the  categories,  which  (because  they  belong  to  pure  under- 
standing) would  necessarily  be  involved4  in  the  experience  of 
any  rational  being  which  depended  upon  any  kind  of  sensuous 
intuition.5 

Perhaps  for  the  sake  of  completeness  Kant  ought  to  have 
asked  whether  we  can  have  a  non-spatial  and  non-temporal 
experience  involving  immediate  intuition  of  an  object.  The

characteristic  of  v6rjai£  vorjaea)£. 

8  That  is  to  say,  their  sensibility  would  be  passive,  but  they  would 
be  unaware  of  colours,  sounds,  and  other  human  sensa. 

4  This  is  true  only  of  the  unschematised  categories. 

5  B  148.  Space  and  time,  as  confined  to  human  experience,  have 
a  more  limited  universality  and  necessity  than  the  categories  (which 
are  not  so  confined).

mystic's  vision  of|God  is  sometimes  described  as  if  it  were 
such  an  experience.  Kant  would  presumably  dismiss  such  a 
claim  as  mere  Sckwarmerei. 

These  speculations  may  seem  unnecessary  and  artificial. 
Nevertheless  they  serve  to  bring  out  important  aspects  of 
Kant's  doctrine.  They  confirm,  for  example,  the  view  that  we 
do  not  understand  why  sensibility  as  such  should  involve  space 
and  time.  More  important  still,  they  show  that  the  necessity 
of  which  Kant  speaks  is  a  necessity  in  relation  to  human 
experience.  It  is  too  often  forgotten  that  Kant  is  consistently 
protesting  against  a  metaphysic  which  claims  by  the  exercise 
of  pure  reason  to  determine  the  necessary  characteristics  of 
ultimate  reality.  He  is  content  with  the  humbler  task  of  deter- 
mining the  element  of  necessity  within  human  experience 
as  such. 

I  do  not  think  it  a  justifiable  criticism  to  say  that  on  this 
view  everything  is  reduced  to  a  mere  matter  of  fact,  and  that 
the  forms  of  human  intuition  might  change.  The  latter  supposi- 
tion itself  presupposes  the  form  of  time,  and  apart  from  so 
doing  it  is  to  us  quite  meaningless.  And  if  we  can  know  space 
and  time  independently  of  experience,  and  also  understand 
how  space  and  time  are  necessary  to  experience,  not  as  its 
matter,  but  as  its  form  or  condition,  it  would  be  foolish  not 
to  admit  that  the  facts  of  space  and  time,  if  we  choose  to  call 
them  so,  are  not  on  the  same  footing  as  the  facts  determined 
by  mere  observation. 

Kant  does  not  explain  how  we  know  that  space  and  time 
are  conditions  of  the  experience  of  other  men,  nor  even  how 
we  know  that  there  are  other  men  who  have  experiences.  On 
a  common-sense  level  we  are,  no  doubt,  entitled  to  assume 
both.  The  existence  of  other  men  is  presupposed  in  our  thought 
and  action ;  and  all  our  thinking,  conspicuously  scientific  think- 
ing, presupposes  also  a  common  world  of  spatio-temporal 
objects  which  we  know.  Nevertheless  Kant's  doctrine  (that 
space  and  time  are  forms  of  appearances  only)  involves  the 
consequence  that  we  know  ourselves  as  appearances  only,  and 
a  fortiori  that  we  know  others  as  appearances  only.  Hence  our 


i8o  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  8 

knowledge  of  other  men  and  their  experience  demands  from 
him  a  special  discussion  which  it  does  not  receive.1 

It  may  also  be  asked  how  we  can  know  that  the  same  space 
and  time  exist  for  different  minds.  Even  if  we  assume  that 
each  mind  comes  to  reality  with  similar  forms  of  sensibility, 
would  not  this  imply  that  each  mind  was  aware  of  appearances 
in  a  similar,  but  different,  space  and  time?  This  question 
Kant,  so  far  as  I  know,  has  not  raised.  For  my  own  part  I 
find  it  difficult  to  understand  what  could  be  meant  by  saying 
that  each  of  two  men  was  aware  of  an  infinite  and  homogeneous 
space  (or  time),  but  that  nevertheless  the  spaces  (or  times) 
were  different.  I  should  have  thought  that  here,  if  anywhere, 
the  principle  of  the  Identity  of  Indiscernibles  was  valid. 

§  8.  Space  and  Time  in  Relation  to  Things-in-themselves 

Are  we  entitled  not  only  to  assert  that  for  us  space  and  time 
must  apply  to  all  appearances,  but  also  to  deny  that  things-in- 
themselves  are  spatial  or  temporal? 

Strictly  speaking,  we  are  entitled  to  say  of  things-in- 
themselves  only  that  we  do  not,  and  cannot,  know  them  to  be 
in  space  and  time.  Since  we  do  not  know  them  at  all,  we  cannot 
say  what  they  are  not.  Nevertheless  Kant  habitually  uses  the 
stronger  expression,  and  I  have  not  scrupled  to  follow  him  in 
so  doing. 

If  Kant's  arguments  are  sound,  the  possibility  that  things-in- 
themselves  might  be  spatial  and  temporal  is  an  empty  and 
ungrounded  possibility,  and  one  which  could  serve  no  useful 
purpose  in  our  thinking.  If  we  put  on  a  pair  of  blue  spectacles, 
it  is  possible  (in  default  of  other  evidence)  that  at  the  same 
time  the  whole  world  really  turns  blue.  It  is  also  possible  that 
the  moon,  as  a  thing-in-itself,  is  made  of  green  cheese.  The 
supposition  that  things-in-themselves  might  be  spatial  and 
temporal  is  of  the  same  order.  We  are  supposing  it  to  be  proved 

1  For  the  Kantian  philosophy  it  is  at  least  as  necessary  to  justify 
our  belief  that  there  are  other  minds  which  are  centres  of  thought 
and  action  as  it  is  to  justify  our  belief  that  there  are  permanent 
physical  substances  which  are  centres  of  force. 


VIII  §9]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  181 

that  space  and  time  as  known  to  us  are  entirely  due  to  the 
nature  of  our  sensibility.  To  insist  that  things-in-themselves 
might  nevertheless  be  spatial  and  temporal,  though  we  could 
never  know  them  to  be  so,  is  to  suggest  the  possibility  of  a 
pre-established  harmony  in  which  we  have  no  reason  whatever 
to  believe,  and  which,  if  it  existed,  could  make  no  conceivable 
difference  to  us.1  To  entertain  groundless  possibilities  is  no 
part  of  the  work  of  philosophy,  and  Kant  is  not  to  be  blamed 
for  refusing  to  admit  as  a  real  possibility  one  which  rests  upon 
no  positive  grounds,  but  merely  upon  blank  ignorance.2 

Strictly  speaking,  however,  all  Kant  is  doing  is  to  set  a 
limit.  On  this  side  of  the  limit  are  appearances  which  must 
be  temporal  and  spatial.  Beyond  that  limit  are  the  things-in- 
themselves  of  whose  characteristics  we  know,  and  can  know, 
nothing. 

§  9.  Time  and  Things-in-themselves 

If  any  positive  grounds  are  brought  forward  in  favour  of 
the  view  that  space  and  time  characterise  things-in-themselves, 
they  must  be  considered  on  their  merits.  One  argument  of 
this  sort  is  examined  by  Kant  in  relation  to  time.3 

Change,  it  is  urged,  is  real,  even  if  the  only  change  is  change 
of  our  ideas ;  and  since  time  is  the  condition  of  change,  time 
must  be  real  too. 

Kant  regards  the  answer  to  this  as  easy.  Time  is  real,  but 
only  subjectively,  only  as  the  condition  of  human  sensibility, 
or  as  the  form  of  inner  sense.  That  is  to  say,  human  sensibility 
is  such  that  I  must  be  aware  of  my  inner  states  as  a  succession 
of  changing  events  in  time.  If  there  were  an  intuition  other 
than  sensuous,  such  intuition  might,  and  he  believes  would, 
apprehend  without  any  reference  to  time,  and  consequently 
without  any  reference  to  change,  the  very  characteristics  of 
the  mind  which  we  intuit  as  changes.  Time  like  space  depends, 

1  Compare  B  166-7. 

2  In  A  388  a  Critical  objection  is  said  to  show  that  a  contention  is 
groundless,  not  that  it  is  wrong  (we  can  show  the  latter  only  by 
knowing  the  object).  *  A  36-8  =  B  53-5. 


i8a  SPACE  AND  TIME  [VIII  §  9 

not  on  the  nature  of  the  thing-in-itself,  but  on  the  nature  of 
the  knowing  subject.  It  is  empirically  real,  and  has  under  it 
necessarily  all  appearances  of  myself  to  myself.  But  this  implies 
no  absolute  reality  either  of  time  or  of  change. 

In  a  footnote  he  gets  nearer  to  the  real  objection.  There 
he  admits  we  can  say  that  our  ideas  follow  one  another,  but 
this  for  him  means  merely  that  we  are  aware  of  them  as  in 
temporal  succession — the  temporal  succession  being  due,  as 
always,  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 

Even  this  hardly  faces  what  seems  to  me  the  real  point  of 
the  argument.  Kant  takes  the  contention  to  be  that  we  are 
aware  of  our  ideas  (or  inner  states)  as  changing  in  time,  and 
he  has  no  difficulty  in  showing  that  we  are  equally  aware  of 
external  objects  as  in  space.  Space  and  time  are  on  precisely 
the  same  footing,  and  if  one  is  only  the  form  of  appearances, 
so  also  is  the  other.  The  objector  does  not,  however,  mean 
merely  that  he  is  aware  of  his  ideas,  or  inner  states,  as  in  time. 
He  means  that  his  awareness  is  also  in  time,  or  is  also  a  temporal 
succession.1  His  contention  is  that  time  has  a  very  special 
reality,  because  it  is  implied,  not  merely  in  what  he  is  aware 
of,  but  in  his  awareness  of  it.  What  he  is  aware  of  may  be 
mere  appearance :  his  awareness  of  it  cannot  be  mere  appearance, 
but  must  be  absolute  reality.  And  if  this  is  so,  time  must  be, 
not  merely  empirically,  but  absolutely,  real. 

I  presume  Kant  would  reply  that  this  contention  is  an 
error.  When  we  say  that  our  awareness  is  in  time,  we  can 
say  so,  only  if  we  are  aware  of  our  awareness,  aware,  that  is 
to  say,  of  a  succession  in  our  ideas.  And  if  we  ask  whether 
our  awareness  of  our  awareness  is  not  also  in  time,  we  embark 
upon  an  infinite  regress,  at  any  stage  of  which  Kant  would 
presumably  give  the  same  answer. 

It  should  be  added  that  when  Kant  denies  that  things-in- 
themselves  are  changing,  he  does  not  mean  to  assert  that 
they  are  permanent  and  unchanging.  Change  and  permanence 

1  I  take  this  to  be  the  real  point  of  the  objections  raised  by  Lambert, 
Sulzer,  Mendelssohn,  and  Schulz;  see  Briefwechsel  (X  102,  107,  and 
no-n)  and  Vaihinger,  Commentary  ii,  pp.  400-1. 


VIII  §  lo]  KANT'S  CONCLUSIONS  183 

alike  presuppose  time,  and  Kant  denies  that  we  can  justifiably 
attribute  any  kind  of  temporal  characteristics  to  things-in- 
themselves. 

§  10.  Value  of  Kanfs  Argument 

It  is  not  unreasonable  to  suppose  that  Kant,  under  the 
influence  of  Leibniz,  continued  to  regard  reality  as  composed 
of  monads,1  although  he  became  convinced  that  the  proofs 
advanced  by  Leibniz  were  fallacious,2  and  indeed  that  know- 
ledge of  ultimate  reality  is  unattainable  by  man. 

If  we  assume  some  such  belief  to  be  at  the  back  of  Kant's 
mind,  it  must  be  remembered  that  for  Kant  the  conception 
of  the  monad  has  altered.  His  monads  are  not  self-sufficient, 
and  there  is  some  sort  of  contact  between  the  knower  and  the 
known.  If  the  mind  of  man  is  a  monad,  it  is  not  a  windowless 
monad,  but  looks  out  through  its  windows  at  reality.  Its 
windows,  however,  are  not  of  transparent  glass.  As  coloured 
glass  imposes  its  colour  on  the  objects  seen,  so  the  windows 
of  our  mind  impose  upon  all  objects  sensed  the  forms  of  time 
and  space,  and  it  is  only  through  these  windows  that  we  can 
be  conscious  even  of  ourselves. 

I  cannot  think  that  such  a  view  is  to  be  rejected  as  an 
impossible  or  self-contradictory  hypothesis,  or  that  the  argu- 
ments urged  in  its  support  can  be  set  aside  as  negligible.  The 
transcendental  ideality  of  space  and  time  has  indeed  the 
appearance  of  paradox;  it  is  as  repugnant  to  believers  in 
common  sense  as  it  is  attractive  to  those  who  look  upon  the 
physical  world  as  a  veil  which  partly  conceals  and  partly 
reveals  a  deeper  spiritual  reality;  but  I  do  not  see  that  its 
paradoxical  character  is  sufficient  to  warrant  its  rejection. 
Nevertheless  Kant's  position,  as  it  stands,  cannot  be  said  to 
have  that  demonstrative  certainty  to  which  he  lays  claim;3 
it  is  rather  in  need  of  that  clarification  and  defence  for  which 
he  begs.4  Such  attempts  at  clarification  and  defence  may  lead

to  new  philosophies  in  the  future,  as  they  have  done  in  the  past. 
The  discussion  of  space  and  time,  it  must  be  remembered, 
is  the  first  of  the  three  main  arguments  by  which  Kant  seeks 
to  establish  his  transcendental  idealism — the  other  two  being 
the  Transcendental  Deduction  of  the  Categories  and  the  Anti- 
nomies. No  final  judgement  can  be  passed  on  any  part,  until 
his  philosophy  has  been  understood  as  a  whole.  For  purposes 
of  exposition  we  must  assume  that  his  central  doctrines  in 
the  Aesthetic  have  been  proved.

LOGIC 


CHAPTER     IX 

FORMAL  LOGIC 

§  i .  Formal  Logic 

Kant  believed,  as  did  most  philosophers  before  the  nine- 
teenth century,  that  Formal  Logic  (or,  as  he  called  it,  General 
Logic)  was  a  science  as  certain  as  mathematics.  It  differed 
from  mathematics  in  being  a  completed  science.  All  the  addi- 
tions made  to  it  since  the  time  of  Aristotle  were,  at  the  best, 
contributions  to  the  elegance  of  the  subject,  not  to  its  certainty : 
too  often  they  were  discussions  illegitimately  introduced  from 
other  sciences  such  as  metaphysics  and  psychology.1 

The  reason  for  the  unique  success  and  completeness  of 
Formal  Logic  is  the  limitation  of  its  subject-matter.  Formal 
Logic  is  concerned  only  with  the  necessary  laws  of  thought, 
which  hold  whatever  be  the  nature  of  the  objects  thought  about. 
It  recognises  that  thought  has  an  object,  and  it  may  be  said 
to  apply  to  all  objects  in  general  ;2  but  it  abstracts  entirely  from 
the  character  of  the  objects,  and  from  all  differences  between 
them.  Hence  it  is  able  to  state  the  formal  rules  of  all  thinking, 
and  to  ignore  the  matter — that  is,  the  content — of  thought. 
For  this  reason  it  is  a  truly  general  logic ;  and  in  it  understanding, 
as  the  faculty  of  thinking,  is  concerned  only  with  itself  and 
its  own  form.3 

Differences  in  the  objects  about  which  we  think  produce 
differences  in  our  thinking.4  Mathematical  thinking,  for 
example,  differs  in  certain  respects  from  biological  thinking. 
If  we  had  a  logic  of  mathematical  thinking,  it  would  contain 
the  rules  for  thinking  rightly  about  a  particular  class  of  objects. 
As  such,  it  would  be  no  longer  formal  or,  in  Kant's  language, 
general.  It  would  be  a  special  (or  particular)  logic  dealing  with 
a  special  (or  particular)  use  of  thought.5 

Again,  there  are  certain  empirical  conditions  under  which

188       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [IX  §2 

our  thought  is  exercised.  It  is  important  to  study  such  questions 
as  the  influence  of  sense,  the  play  of  imagination,  the  laws 
of  memory,  the  nature  of  attention,  doubt,  scruple,  conviction, 
and  so  on ;  and  also  the  sources  of  error,  and  the  part  played 
by  inclination  or  habit  in  fostering  prejudice.  A  logic  dealing 
with  such  questions  (though  it  would  still  be  general)  would  be 
applied  (not  pure)  logic.  It  would  borrow  from  psychology,  and 
might  properly  be  regarded  as  part  of  psychology.1 

Formal  Logic,  as  distinguished  from  special  and  from 
applied  logic,  must  be  (i)  general  (or  perhaps  better  universal) 
and  (2) pure  or  a  priori.  As  general,  it  abstracts  from  all  differ- 
ences in  objects,  and  deals  only  with  the  form  of  thought. 
As  pure,  it  admits  of  no  empirical  principles  such  as  belong 
to  psychology,  and  everything  in  it  must  be  certain  a  priori? 

Since  Formal  Logic  is  concerned  with  the  laws  common 
to  all  thinking,  it  necessarily  ignores  the  special  laws  which 
govern  synthetic  a  priori  thinking :  it  ignores  in  fact  the  problem 
of  the  Kritik. 

The  philosophical  logic  of  the  present  time  would  question 
the  possibility  of  making  such  a  sharp  separation  between  the 
form  and  the  matter  of  thought.  Mathematical  logic,  on  the 
other  hand,  accepts  the  view  that  logic  is  the  science  of  pure 
form,  but  it  interprets  form  in  a  way  different  from  that  of 
Kant.  If  we  are  to  understand  him,  we  must  put  ourselves 
at  the  point  of  view  of  the  eighteenth  century.  To  his  mis- 
fortune the  doctrine  of  the  categories  is  largely  based  on  the 
logic  of  his  time,  which  since  then  has  suffered  serious,  and 
perhaps  shattering,  blows.  But  this  is  no  reason  why  we  should 
refuse  to  understand  his  argument,  and  still  less  why  we  should 
adopt  towards  him  an  attitude  of  superiority. 

§  2.  Divisions  of  Formal  Logic 

Formal  Logic  is  divided  into  a  Doctrine  of  Elements  and 
a  Doctrine  of  Method.3  The  latter  is  a  practical  or  technical

IX  §2]  FORMAL  LOGIC  189 

part  of  logic — an  art  rather  than  a  science.  It  is  concerned 
mainly  with  the  distinctness,  exactness,  and  systematic  arrange- 
ment of  knowledge,  and  deals  with  such  questions  as  definition 
and  division.1 

The  Doctrine  of  Elements  is  the  theoretic  or  dogmatic  part 
of  logic,2  and  is  divided  into  Analytic  and  Dialectic. 

The  Analytic  analyses  the  whole  formal  business  of  under- 
standing or  thought  into  its  elements,  and  it  exhibits  these 
elements  as  first  principles  for  all  logical  criticism  of  our 
knowledge.3 

Since  logic  abstracts  from  all  reference  to  particular  objects, 
and  truth  is  correspondence  of  thought  with  its  object,4  it  is 
clear  that  logical  criticism  is  concerned,  not  with  truth,  but 
with  formal  validity.  All  that  logic  can  give  us  is  a  formal 
or  negative  criterion  of  truth.5  If  our  judgements  are  not 
consistent  with  themselves,  or  not  in  accordance  with  the 
formal  laws  of  thought,  then  they  are  false;  but  a  judgement 
which  is  free  from  formal  contradiction  may  have  no  cor- 
responding object,  and  so  is  far  from  being  necessarily  true.6 

In  this  way  logic  is  a  canon,  riot  an  organon.1  It  states  only 
the  negative  condition,  the  conditio  sine  qua  non,  of  truth. 
It  can  be  used  only  for  criticism,  not  for  purposes  of  extending 
knowledge.8 

When  logic  is  used  for  purposes  of  extending  or  producing 
knowledge,  it  is  being  used  as  an  organon.  Such  use  is  'dialec-

to  cannot  be  given  in  intuition  (empirical  or  pure),  then  the  judgement

IQO        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC     [IX  §  3 

tical',  and  is  always  illegitimate.  The  part  of  logic  which 
criticises  such  use  is  called  Dialectic,  and  is  the  second  part 
of  the  Doctrine  of  Elements.1  It  is  the  logic,  not  of  formal 
validity,  but  of  illusion. 

The  distinction  of  Analytic  and  Dialectic  goes  back  to  the 
distinction  in  Aristotle  between  the  Analytics  and  the  Topics.2 
The  word  *  Analytics*  refers  in  Aristotle  primarily  to  analysis 
of  reasoning  into  the  figures  of  the  syllogism.  The  Topics  are 
a  study  of  dialectical  reasoning,  or  of  the  dialectical  syllogism, 
whose  premises  are  merely  probable,  not  scientific.3 

Kant  is  therefore  using  terms  which  refer  to  a  traditional 
distinction  in  Formal  Logic;  but  the  interpretation  he  gives 
to  Dialectic  seems  to  be  a  preparation  for  the  Dialectic  of 
Transcendental  Logic. 

The  Analytic  of  Formal  Logic  is  traditionally  divided  into 
three  sections,  the  first  dealing  with  concepts,  the  second  with 
judgement,  the  third  with  inference,  usually  identified  with 
syllogistic  reasoning.  The  corresponding  powers  or  faculties 
are  understanding,  judgement,4  and  reason.  'Understanding' 
is  also  used  in  a  wider  sense  to  cover  all  three.6 

§  3.  Formal  Logic  is  entirely  a  priori 

For  Kant  all  the  laws  of  logic  are  known  a  priori,  that  is, 
independently  of  all  experience.6  This  means  that  they  are

IX  §  3]  FORMAL  LOGIC  191 

Formal  Logic  is  an  a  priori  science  because  the  rules  or  laws 
of  thought,  with  which  it  deals,  are  universal  and  necessary, 
and  the  universal  and  necessary  must  be  known  a  priori.  The 
necessity  of  the  laws  of  thought  seems  to  follow,  for  Kant, 
from  the  fact  that  logic  is  formal:  just  because  logic  is  formal, 
it  ignores  all  differences  in  the  objects  of  thought,  and  the  laws 
which  it  sets  forth  must  hold  whatever  be  the  nature  of  the 
objects  thought.1  Laws  which  depend  on  the  character  of 
a  determinate  object  are  contingent:  they  vary  with  the  object, 
and  it  is  a  matter  of  accident  whether  I  think  of  this  object 
or  not. 

When  we  dealt  with  intuition  in  the  Aesthetic,  we  abstracted 
from  the  varying  matter  of  sense,  and  found  the  common 
or  universal  forms  to  be  space  and  time.  These  were  said  to  be 
known  a  priori,  not  merely  because  they  were  universal  con- 
ditions of  sensation,  but  also  because  they  were  wholes  of  such 
a  kind  that  it  could  be  known  what  their  parts  must  be.  Space 
and  time  are  not  merely  necessary  to  sensible  intuition:  they 
have  a  kind  of  internal  necessity  in  themselves.  It  was  this 
double  necessity  which  justified  us  in  holding  that  they  were 
the  form,  and  not  the  matter,  of  intuition. 

In  dealing  with  thought  we  abstract2  from  the  varying 
matter  (or  content)  of  thought,  and  seek  to  find  a  common 
or  universal  form  of  thought ;  and  in  this  case  also  there  should 
be  an  intelligible  necessity  to  be  discovered  in  the  form  of 
thought  itself.  This  is,  I  believe,  Kant's  view,  although  it  is 
not  too  clearly  expressed.  By  reflexion  on  the  use  of  under- 

1  Log.  Einl.  I  (IX  12).  It  is  a  very  common  mistake  to  say  that 
for  Kant  logic  treats  thought  as  if  thought  had  no  object.  What  Kant 
says,  when  he  is  speaking  carefully,  is  that  it  ignores  differences  in 
objects  (see,  for  example,  A  52  =  B  76),  and  this  is  true.  Further- 
more, though  Formal  Logic  always  assumes  that  there  are  objects  of 
thought,  it  is  under  no  obligation  to  explain  what  such  objects  are. 
It  merely  supposes  that  objects  are  given. 

2  The  act  of  abstraction  here  must  differ  from  that  in  the  Aesthetic 
(see  Chapter  V  §  9),  for  it  does  not  give  us  individual  wholes  like 
space  and  time :  it  must  also  apparently  differ  in  some  way  from  that 
involved  in  thinking  empirical  concepts,  since  what  it  gives  us  has 
an  intelligible  necessity  of  its  own. 


192        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [IX  §  4 

standing  in  general,  without  reference  to  particular  objects, 
we  are  said  to  discover  the  laws  of  thought,  which  are  absolutely 
necessary;  for  without  them  we  should  not  think  at  all.1 

This  is  plausible  enough  when  we  consider  the  law  of 
non-contradiction,  the  supreme  principle  of  Formal  Logic.2 
It  is  also  plausible,  on  the  suppositions  of  Formal  Logic,  when 
we  consider  syllogistic  reasoning  and  the  figures  of  the  syllo- 
gism.3 It  is  not  so  plausible,  when  we  are  concerned  with  the 
form  of  the  concept,  and  still  less  when  we  are  concerned  with 
the  forms  of  the  judgement.  Kant  assumes  that  necessity  and 
universality  are  found,  and  must  be  found,  in  the  logical 
account  of  the  concept  and  the  judgement,  because  the  subject 
there  discussed  is  form,  and  not  matter;  but  the  question 
clearly  demands  further  examination. 

§  4.  The  Matter  of  Concepts 

A  concept  is  a  general  (or  universal)  idea  as  opposed  to 
a  singular  idea  or  intuition.  As  general  it  is  an  idea  of  what 
is  common  to  many  different  objects,  whereas  an  intuition 
is  an  idea  of  one  individual  object.4 

The  matter  of  concepts  is  their  object:  their  form  is  their 
universality.5  The  universality  of  concepts  is  necessary  to 
judgement,  and  consequently  to  thought. 

1  Log.  Einl.  I  (IX  12).  The  laws  of  thought  are  formal,  and  Kant 
sometimes  speaks  as  if  'laws*  and  'forms'  of  thought  were  the  same 
thing.  As  in  the  case  of  the  forms  of  intuition,  Kant  fails  to  stress 
sufficiently  the  double  necessity  present  in  the  forms  of  thought, 
though  his  doctrine  seems  to  me  clear  enough.  The  forms  of  thought 
are  seen  to  be  necessary  (i)  in  themselves,  and  (2)  as  the  conditions 
of  all  thinking.  If  they  had  not  the  first  kind  of  necessity,  they  could 
not  have  the  second.  Compare  Chapter  VII  §  4. 

2  A  151  =  B  190. 

8  The  figures  of  the  syllogism  themselves  depend,  however,  on 
the  forms  of  judgement,  which  are  presupposed  by  Formal  Logic  in 
the  doctrine  of  the  syllogism. 

4  Log.  §  i  (IX  91).  There  is  no  distinction  here  between  'universal* 
and  'general*,  and  there  is  a  verbal  play  on  ' allgemein*  (general)  and 
'gemein*  (common). 

6  Log.  §  2  (IX  91).  At  times  Kant  speaks  as  if  the  concept  were  the 
form  (or  the  way  in  which  we  know  the  object):  see  Log.  Einl.  V 
(IX  33).  In  Log.  §  5  Anmerk.  i  (IX  94)  Formal  Logic  is  said  to  con- 


IX  §  4]  FORMAL  LOGIC  193 

When  Kant  speaks  of  the  object  as  the  Matter'  of  the  con- 
cept, or  more  generally  of  objects  as  the  'matter'  of  thought, 
there  is  a  risk  of  misunderstanding,  against  which  we  must 
be  on  our  guard.  The  matter  of  thought  is  what  we  think, 
and  the  matter  of  a  concept  is  what  we  conceive,  but  it  would 
perhaps  be  better  to  speak  of  it  as  the  content,  rather  than  the 
object,  of  thought  or  conception.1  That  there  is  for  Kant 
a  difference  between  the  content  and  the  object  of  thought 
is  shown  by  his  view  that  truth  is  the  correspondence  of  thought 
with  its  object.  We  have  not  yet  dealt  with  Kant's  theory 
of  the  object  proper  (the  phenomenal  object),  but  we  may  say 
provisionally  that  an  object  proper  must  be  given  to  sense  (or  at 
least  be  capable  of  being  given  to  sense) ;  and  it  is  possible  to  have 
an  arbitrary  concept  (such  as  the  concept  of  chimaera)  which, 
although  it  certainly  has  a  content,  has  no  corresponding  object.2 

It  is  to  be  observed  that  Kant  habitually  uses  concrete  rather 
than  abstract  words  for  the  purpose  of  indicating  particular 
concepts.  Thus  he  speaks,  not  of  the  concept  of  spatiality 
(as  I  have  done  for  the  sake  of  clearness),  but  of  the  concept 
of  'spaces  in  general'.3  Similarly  he  speaks  of  the  concept 
'body'  or  the  concept  of  'the  body'.4  This  must  not  blind 

sider  the  concept  only  as  regards  its  form,  that  is,  as  regards  the  way 
in  which  it  can  be  referred  to  objects;  and  this  form  is  said  to  be 
necessary  for  judgement. 

1  This  is,   I  think,  implied  in  Log.  §19  (IXioi).  The  word  for 
content  is  llnhalt\  which  in  the  case  of  concepts  can  also  be  translated 
as  'intension'  or  Connotation'.   I  am  not  quite  sure  of  this  point. 
Kant  may  perhaps  use  'matter'  for  what  I  think  is  sometimes  called 
the  'objective*  or  'objectives'  (as  opposed  to  the  objects)  of  thought. 
In  A  598-9  —  B  626-7  he  seems  to  use  'Objekt*  for  the  'objective* 
of  thought  (which  need  not  be  real)  and  'Gegemtand'  for  the  'object' 
(which  must  be  a  real  thing).  But  his  usage  is  not  consistent. 

2  Compare  A  729  =  B  757.  Yet  even  here  we  must  distinguish  the 
concept  of  chimaera  from  the  individual  chimaeras  which  we  imagine 
as  falling  under  that  concept. 

3  See  A  25  =  B  39.  He  also  speaks  of  the  categories  as  concepts 
of  objects  in  general  (A  93  =^=  B  126)  and  as  concepts  of  an  object 
in  general  (B  128). 

4  See  Log.  §  8  (IX  96)  'der  Begriff  Korper*  and  A  69  =  B  94  €der 
Begriff  des  Ko'rpers*.  He  also  uses  'der  Begriff  vony  as  in  'der  Begriff 
vom  Hundc';  see  A  141  =  B  180.

us  to  the  fact  that  the  content  of  a  concept  is  not  an  individual 
object  or  objects.1  A  concept  is  an  idea  of  what  is  common 
to  several  objects;  it  is  repraesentatio per  notas  communes?  and, 
as  we  have  seen,  its  content  is  composed  of  'partial  represen- 
tations' or  'partial  concepts'.3 

It  is  obvious  enough  that  a  concept  (if  we  ignore  the  possi- 
bility of  there  being  some  concepts  which  are  simple)4  is  made 
up  of  concepts  which  are  part  of  itself;  but  this  does  not  seem 
to  be  the  reason  why  Kant  speaks  of  concepts  as  containing 
partial  representations  or  partial  concepts.  On  the  contrary, 
the  main  point  of  this  expression  seems  to  be  that  the  content 
of  our  concepts  is  contained  in  our  individual  ideas,  or  in- 
tuitions, of  objects  themselves.5  The  yellowness  which  is  part 
of  the  content  of  our  concept  of  gold  is  contained  in  our  in- 
tuition of  each  individual  piece  of  gold. 

On  this  view  every  concept  is  a  partial  concept,  since  no 
concept  can  be  adequate  to  our  intuitions  of  individual  things.6 
Likewise  every  concept  is  a  'mark'  of  the  individual  things 
which  fall  under  the  concept,7  and  (so  far  as  it  is  not  simple) 

1  We  have  seen  this  already  as  regards  the  content  of  the  concepts 
of  spatiality  and  temporality.  See  Chapter  V  §  7. 

2  See  Log.  §  i  (IX  91).  The  German  for  'nota*  is  'MerkmaV  (a 
mark). 

3  '  Teilvorstellungen\    ' Partialvorstellungert ',    or    *  Teilbegriffe*.    See 
Chapter  V  §  7. 

4  See  Log.  Einl.  VIII  (IX  59).  Simple  concepts  cannot  be  further 
analysed. 

6  Both  views  are  present  in  Kant;  see  Log.  Einl.  VIII  and  also 
§  7  (IX  58-9  and  95).  Compare  Vaihinger,  Commentar,  ii,  pp.  240 
and  376. 

6  'Every  concept,  as  a  partial  concept  (Teilbegriff)t  is  contained  in 
the  idea  of  things*;  see  Log.  §  7  (IX  95).  Compare  Log.  §  i  (IX  91): 
'A  concept  is  ...  an  idea  of  what  is  common  to  several  objects,  and 
therefore  an  idea  so  far  as  it  can  be  contained  in  different  ideas' 
(?  or  objects).  See  also  B  133  n.  A  concept,  however,  can  never  be 
completely  determined  (omnimode  determinatus) :  it  is  only  individual 
things,  and  apparently  also  intuitions,  which  can  be  so  determined. 
See  Log.  §  15  (IX  99).  It  may  be  observed  that  in  definition  it  is 
possible  for  a  concept  to  be  'complete  determinatus',  that  is,  to  be 
'rei  adaequatus  in  minimis  terminis* ;  but  this  has  a  different  meaning. 
See  Log.  §  99  (IX  140).  7  See  Log.  Einl.  VIII  (IX  58). 


IX  §4]  FORMAL  LOGIC  195 

it  is  made  up  of  such  'marks'.1  From  one  point  of  view  the 
matter  of  the  concept  is  contained  as  a  'partial  representation* 
in  our  intuitions  of  individual  things;  from  another  point  of 
view  the  matter  of  a  concept  consists  of  'marks'  whereby  we 
are  able  to  recognise2  individual  things  given  to  us  in  in- 
tuition.3 Yellowness  is  not  only  a  'partial  representation' 
contained  in  our  intuitions  of  pieces  of  gold;  it  is  also  one 
of  the  marks  whereby  we  can  recognise  pieces  of  gold  and 
distinguish  them  from  other  things.4  Considered  as  made  up 
of  'partial  representations'  every  concept  has  a  content5  (that 
is,  intension  or  connotation);  considered  as  made  up  of 
'marks'  every  concept  has  an  extension  or,  perhaps  better, 
denotation.6 

This  is  not  the  place  to  consider  the  difficult  questions 
raised  by  these  distinctions.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity  it  will 
be  convenient  to  speak  of  concepts  as  made  up  of  'marks', 
ignoring  the  difference  between  'marks'  and  'partial  representa- 


1  For  example,  among  the  'marks'  contained  in  the  concept  of 
'body*,  we  may  reckon  substance,  force,  divisibility,  impenetrability, 
hardness,  colour,  extension,  and  figure.  See  A  20-1  =  B  35. 

2  'erkennen* 

3  'A  mark  ...  is  a  "partial  representation*',  so  far  as  the  "partial 
representation"  is  considered  as  a  criterion  (Erkenntnisgrund)  of  the 
whole  idea' ;  and  so  as  a  criterion  of  the  thing  itself.  See  Log.  EM. 
VIII  (IX  58).  Perhaps  'Erkenntnisgrund'  might  be  translated  as  'causa 
cognoscendi*.  'The  whole  idea'  cannot,  in  my  opinion,  be  the  whole 
concept  here,  and  must  be  the  whole  intuition,  though  the  language 
is  not  unambiguous. 

4  Kant  distinguishes,  in  Log.  EM.  VIII  (1X58),  between  the 
internal  and  the  external  use  of  'marks'.  6  'Inhalt.' 

6  'Umfang*  or  'sphaera\  This  seems  to  refer  primarily  to  the 
individual  things  of  which  the  concept  is  the  criterion,  or  mark;  but 
I  believe  it  sometimes  refers  also  to  the  species.  Kemp  Smith,  I 
think,  usually  translates  '  Umfang*  as  'extension*. 

Note  particularly  that  the  connotation  is  contained  in  the  concept, 
the  extension  (species)  and  denotation  (individuals)  are  contained 
under  it.  It  is  easy  to  get  confused  on  this  point,  since  Kant  speaks 
of  the  species  as  'concepts'  ('lower  concepts'),  and  of  the  individuals 
as  'ideas'  (Vorstellungeri).  We  must  not  imagine  that  the  concepts  and 
ideas  contained  under  a  concept  are  the  partial  concepts  or  ideas 
contained  in  it. 


196        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [IX  §  5 

tions'.1  It  must,  however,  be  noted  that  the  universality  of  the 
concept  (which  we  have  seen  to  be  identical  with  its  form) 
rests,  not  on  the  fact  that  the  concept  is  a  'partial  representa- 
tion', but  on  the  fact  that  it  is  a  criterion  or  mark.2  We  may 
put  this  point  more  simply  by  saying  that  a  concept  is  universal 
because  of  its  use  as  a  mark  (or  set  of  marks)  for  the  recognition 
of  individual  things.  To  say  this  is  to  say  that  the  universality 
or  form  of  the  concept  is  essentially  dependent  upon  judge- 
ment; and  we  shall  find  that  such  is  Kant's  view.3 

§  5'  Different  Types  of  Concept 

We  can  understand  Kant's  doctrine  most  easily  at  the 
present  stage,  if  we  think  of  ordinary  empirical  concepts,  but 
we  must  remember  that  the  matter  of  concepts  originates 
in  different  ways.  This  gives  rise  to  a  series  of  distinctions, 
the  study  of  which  belongs  properly  to  Transcendental  Logic. 

As  regards  its  matter  a  concept  may  be  given  empirically 
to  sense ;  or  it  may  be  given  a  priori  from  the  nature  of  under- 
standing itself;  or  it  may  be  arbitrarily  constructed.  In  the  first 
case  we  have  an  empirical  concept  ;4  in  the  second  an  intellectual 
concept  or  notion  (the  reference  is  primarily  to  the  categories) ; 
in  the  third  an  arbitrary  or  factitious  concept.6  Factitious 
concepts  are  the  result  of  an  arbitrary  combination  of  elements 
given  either  empirically  or  a  priori.  Obviously  factitious 
concepts  might  also  be  regarded  as  empirical  or  a  priori  ac- 

1  This  is  not  without  warrant  in  Kant  himself;  see,  for  example, 
Log.  EM.  VIII  (IX  59-62)  and  compare  A  43  =  B  60. 

8  See  Log.  §  7  (IX  95).  This  almost  looks  as  if  the  matter  of  the 
concept,  qud  'partial  representation',  were  still  an  intuition  or  part 
of  an  intuition,  a  doctrine  which  may  -be  compared  with  that  of 
Berkeley.  8  See  A  69  =  B  94  and  compare  Chapter  XI  §§  4-5. 

4  An  empirical  concept  may,  however,  contain  marks  which    are 
given  a  priori,  as  the  concept  of  body  contains,  or  presupposes,  the 
mark  or  concept  of  substance.  An  empirical  concept  is  also  called  a 
concept  of  experience  (Erfahrungsbegriff). 

5  Thus  there  are  two  kinds  of  conceptus  dati  (gegebene  Begriffe)  to 
be   opposed  to   conceptus  factitii  (gemachte  Begriffe).   A  factitious 
concept  is  also  called  arbitrary  (willkUrlich)  and  fictitious  or  imaginary 
(gedichtet  and  erdichtet). 


IX  §  5]  FORMAL  LOGIC  19? 

cording  to  the  nature  of  the  elements  which  constitute  their 
content.  Thus  the  concept  of  centaur1  might  be  regarded 
as  an  empirical  factitious  concept,  while  the  concept  of  a 
substance  which  was  permanently  present  in  space  without 
filling  it2  might  be  regarded  as  an  a  priori  factitious  concept. 
In  the  latter  kind  of  concept  Kant  takes  a  special  interest, 
but  he  appears  not  to  make  this  distinction.3 

Kant  does,  however,  recognise  one  special  kind  of  arbitrary 
or  factitious  concept  which  may  be  called  a  priori,  namely  the 
mathematical  concept*  These  concepts,  I  take  it,  are  arbitrary 
only  in  the  sense  that  they  are  concepts  of  figures  which  can 
be  constructed  a  priori  in  a  perfectly  homogeneous  space: 
Kant  always  assumes  that  they  must  be  in  accordance  with 
the  nature  of  space.  The  objects  which  they  denote  are  arbitra- 
rily delimited  spaces,  which,  as  containing  no  sensible  matter, 
are  the  forms  of  objects  rather  than  objects  in  the  strict  sense.5 

It  is  clear  that  the  most  important  types  of  concept  are 
(i)  empirical  concepts,  (2)  intellectual  concepts  or  notions, 
and  (3)  mathematical  concepts.  These  are  the  three  types 
with  which  Kant  usually  deals,  but  it  is  necessary  to  recognise 

1  One  example  Kant  himself  gives  is  'a  ship's  clock*.  See  A  729 

=  B  757- 

2  See  A  222  =  B  270,  where  other  examples  are  given.  Compare 
also  A  96  and  A  84  —  B  117.   In  the  last  passage  'luck*  and  'fate* 
are  called  'usurpatory  concepts'  (usurpierte  Bcgriffe)\  compare  'casus* 
and  'fatum'  in  A  228  =  B  280. 

3  In  A  96  he  speaks  as  if  'arbitrary  and  absurd  fictions'  might  be 
a  priori  cognitions,  but  in  A  222  =  B  269  he  seems  to  think  concepts 
of  this  kind  have  some  matter  drawn  from  sense-perception;  and  it 
may  be  maintained  that  such  factitious  concepts  cannot  properly  be 
regarded  as  a  priori,  since  they  lack  the  character  of  necessity. 

*  See  A  729  =  B  757  and  Log.  §  102  (IX  141).  In  the  latter  passage 
mathematical  concepts  are  opposed  to  all  other  factitious  concepts 
as  conceptus  factitii  a  priori  to  concept  us  fact  it  ii  per  synthesin  empiricam. 
Curiously  enough,  Kant  speaks  here  as  if  mathematical  concepts 
alone  were  made  arbitrarily,  and  as  if  all  empirical  concepts  were 
made  by  an  empirical  synthesis  which  is  not  arbitrary:  yet  he  still 
speaks  of  concepts  given  a  posteriori  in  Log.  §§  101  and  104  (IX  141 
and  142).  There  would  seem  to  be  some  confusion  here,  perhaps 
due  to  the  notetaker,  unless  *  given'  and  'made'  are  used  in  a  special

that  there  are  also  factitious  concepts  which  are  not  mathe- 
matical.1 

All  these  distinctions  concern  the  matter  of  concepts,  and 
it  is  in  relation  to  their  matter  that  concepts  are  said  to  be 
sometimes  given  and  sometimes  factitious  (or  made).  Even 
in  the  case  of  factitious  concepts  it  is  clear,  from  Kant's  ex- 
amples, that  the  matter  (or  the  elements  of  which  the  matter 
is  composed)  is  not  made:2  all  that  we  make  is  the  special 
combination  of  the  elements,  whether  these  are  given  empiric- 
ally or  a  priori? 

§6.  The  Form  of  Concepts 

The  form  of  concepts  is  always  made  and  not  given.  This, 
I  take  it,  is  because  a  concept  to  be  a  concept,  that  is,  to  be 
a  general  or  universal  idea,  must  be  used  as  the  mark  of  objects 
capable  (or  supposed  to  be  capable)  of  being  given  in  intuition.4 

1  The  main  references  for  these  distinctions  are  to  be  found  in 
Log.  §§  4-5  and  100-104  (IX  93-4  and  141-2)  and  in  A  727  =  B  755  ff. 
They  are  all-important  for  the  study  of  Kant's  argument,  for  example, 
in  A  219  =  6266  ff. 

Kant  never  considers  the  concepts  of  spatiality  and  temporality, 
which  seem  to  me  to  be  in  a  class  by  themselves.  They  can  hardly  be 
called  factitious  or  mathematical,  for  there  is  nothing  arbitrary  about 
them.  As  we  have  seen,  they  are  derived  from,  and  dependent  upon, 
our  pure  intuitions,  in  somewhat  the  same  way  that  empirical  con- 
cepts are  derived  from,  and  dependent  upon,  empirical  intuitions. 
They  are  not  given,  like  the  categories  or  Ideas  of  reason,  in  the 
nature  of  our  understanding  or  reason.  See  Chapter  V  §  8. 

2  The  elements  of  those  *  absurd  and  arbitrary  fictions*  which  may 
be,  or  at  least  seem  to  be,  a  priori  cognitions  would  never  even  arise 
in  thought  apart  from  data ;  see  A  96. 

8  This  in  turn  implies  that  the  combination  of  the  matter  of  given 
concepts  (whether  empirical  or  a  priori)  is  also  in  some  sense  given, 
although  not  without  the  jco-operation  of  thought.  Compare  B  130, 
B  134,  B  161. 

4  Log.  §  4  (IX  93).  Kant  says  'the  form  of  a  concept,  as  a  discursive 
idea,  is  always  made'.  To  be  a  discursive  (that  is,  a  general  and  so 
mediate)  idea  it  must  be  used  as  a  means  to  know  objects  imme- 
diately given  in  intuition ;  and  all  human  thought  (or  judgement)  is 
essentially  discursive  or  mediate  in  this  sense.  Compare  A  19  =  B  33. 
We  must  for  the  present  ignore  the  case  of  concepts  which  have  no 
object  given  in  intuition. 


IX  §  6]  FORMAL  LOGIC  199 

Formal  Logic,  just  because  it  is  formal,  must  ignore  all  the 
differences  in  concepts  which  are  due  to  differences  in  the 
origin  of  their  matter.  It  is  concerned  only  with  the  nature 
of  the  concept  as  such,  that  is,  with  its  form  or  universality; 
and  this  Kant  identifies  with  the  way  in  which  the  concept 
can  be  referred  to  a  plurality  of  objects.1 

Concepts  are  made,  as  regards  their  form,  by  logical  acts 
of  the  understanding,  namely,  by  comparison,  reflexion,  and 
abstraction.  Of  this  Kant  gives  a  simple  example.  I  see  a 
spruce,  a  lime,  and  a  willow.  I  compare  them,  and  observe  that 
they  differ  from  one  another  as  regards  their  trunk,  their 
branches,  their  leaves.2  I  reflect  on  what  they  have  in  common, 
namely  trunk,  branches,  and  leaves.  And  I  abstract  from  their 
size,  shape,  and  so  on;  that  is,  I  abstract  from  everything 
in  which  the  seen  objects  differ  from  one  another.  In  this  way 
I  obtain  a  concept  of  'tree'.3 

This  is  Kant's  account  of  the  logical  origin  of  concepts  as 
regards  their  form.  I  take  it  to  be  an  account  of  what  is  neces- 
sarily involved  in  every  act  of  conceiving.4  To  conceive  is  to 
think  in  abstraction  a  common  element  found,  or  assumed  to  be 
found,  in  different  instances.  Only  in  this  way  can  a  concept 
be  related  to  different  instances  by  means  of  their  common 
marks,  and  so  be  a  universal  or  general  idea.  Kant  holds  this  to 
be  true  of  all  concepts,  whatever  be  the  origin  of  their  matter.5 

1  Lo£.§5(IX94). 

2  This  must  mean  as  regards  the  character  (size,  shape,  and  so  on) 
of  their  trunk,  branches,  and  leaves. 

8  Log.  §  6  (IX  94).  There  are  further  details  as  to  the  nature  of 
reflexion,  comparison,  and  abstraction,  but  these  must  here  be  omitted. 

4  The  question  of  the  origin  of  concepts,  as  regards  their  form, 
raises  the  question,  'What  acts  of  the  understanding  constitute  a 
concept?';  or — what  according  to  Kant  is  the  same  thing — 'What 
acts  belong  to  the  production  of  a  concept  out  of  given  ideas?'  See 

Lo£.§5(IX93). 

5  These   three   logical   operations   of  the   understanding  are   the 
essential  and  universal  conditions  for  the  making  of  any  and  every 
concept  (eines  jeden  Begriffes  iiberhaupt).   See  Log.  §  6  Anrnerk.    i 
(IX  94-5).  I  take  it  that  even  a  pure  concept  of  the  understanding 
has  to  be  made  'clear'   in  this  way;    see  A  195-6  =  8240-1   and 
Chapter  XLIV  §  2. 


200       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [IX  §  6 

Kant's  account  might  also  be  taken  as  a  description  of  the 
process  of  producing  concepts  out  of  given  ideas  or,  in  his 
own  words,  'an  investigation  of  the  first  efforts  of  our  power 
of  cognition  whereby  we  rise  from  individual  sense-perceptions 
to  general  ideas'.1  Such  an  investigation  might  be  psycho- 
logical or,  as  he  calls  it,  physiological  ;2  and  inasmuch  as  it  is 
empirical,  it  has  properly  no  place  in  Formal  Logic.  It  is 
possible  that  Kant  fails  to  distinguish  clearly  between  the 
logical  and  the  psychological  enquiry ;  but  I  think  that  for  him 
the  logical  enquiry  is  concerned  only  with  what  is  necessary  for 
the  making  or  thinking  of  any  and  every  concept,  if  it  is  to  be 
a  concept. 

As  regards  the  psychological  question,  I  believe  Kant  to  hold 
that  all  concepts  are  gradually  sorted  out  from  experience, 
and  our  explicit  or  'clear*  knowledge  of  them  is  of  compara- 
tively late  development.3  This  does  not  mean  that  they  are  all 
dependent  upon  sensuous  experience ;  for  the  matter  of  some 
concepts  may  be  derived,  not  from  the  nature  of  given  in- 
tuitions, but  from  the  nature  of  thought  itself.4 

The  whole  doctrine  may  be  taken  as  an  elaboration  of  the 
common  view,  which  also  is  not  without  its  ambiguity,  that 
concepts  are  known  by  abstraction  from  individual  objects.5 
Kant  is  careful  to  note  that  abstraction  is  only  the  negative 
condition  for  making  general  concepts:  the  positive  condition 
is  comparison  and  reflexion.6  He  sometimes  refers  to  the 
whole  act  involved  as  abstraction,7  or  even  as  reflexion;8  and 
in  the  Kritik  he  implies  that  it  is  an  act  of  analysis. 

In  one  passage  Kant  speaks  as  if  logic  itself  turned  given 
ideas  (or  intuitions)  into  concepts  by  means  of  analysis.9  This 
is  a  loose  employment  of  terms.  Logic  gives  us  an  account 

1  A  86  =  B  118-19.  2  A  86-7  =  B  119. 

8  See  A  85-6  =  B  118  and  A  195-6  =  B  240-1. 

4  This  doctrine  of  Kant's  about  the  nature  of  the  categories  must 
at  present  be  taken  on  trust.  For  the  purpose  of  following  his  argu- 
ment it  is  advisable  to  use  only  empirical  concepts  as  examples. 

6  Compare  G.  F.  Meier,  Auszug  §  259.

IX  §  6]  FORMAL  LOGIC  201 

of  the  method  by  which  this  transmutation  is  performed,  but 
it  is  absurd  to  suppose  that  for  Kant  the  form  of  all  concepts 
is  made  by  the  science  of  logic  itself.  A  more  correct  statement 
can  be  found  elsewhere.  'Different  ideas  are  brought  under 
a  concept  analytically  (a  procedure  treated  of  in  general  logic)'.1 
The  act  of  analysis  which  is  involved  in  all  conception  is  also 
alluded  to  in  a  difficult  passage,2  where  Kant  says  that  the 
analytic  unity  of  consciousness  belongs  to  all  common  ideas 
as  such,  and  that  it  is  the  analytic  unity  of  consciousness  which 
makes  an  idea  a  conceptus  communis? 

It  is  to  be  observed  that  the  act  of  analysis,  while  it  seems 
to  involve  judgement,  is  not  to  be  identified  with  analytic 
judgement  in  the  technical  sense.  An  analytic  judgement  is 
essentially  a  judgement  made  by  analysis  of  a  concept ;  here 
we  are  concerned  with  making  concepts  by  analysis  of  in- 
tuitions. I  mention  this  distinction  because  a  failure  to  recog- 
nise it  is,  I  think,  one  of  the  grounds  for  the  mistaken  view 
that  Formal  Logic  deals  only  with  the  form  of  analytic  judge- 
ments.4 

It  is  also  to  be  observed,  not  only  that  the  act  of  making 
a  concept  (which  I  take  to  be  identical  with  the  act  of  con- 
ceiving6) seems  to  be  an  act  of  judging,6  but  also  that  all  judging, 

1  A  78  =  6104.  a  B  133-4  n. 

3  The  phrase  'analytic  unity  of  consciousness*  is  obscure.  The 
general  doctrine  of  this  passage  is,  however,  clear:  that  in  order  to 
know  the  common  element  in  different  ideas  (or  objects)  by  an  act 
of  analysis  I  must  necessarily  hold  these  ideas  (or  objects)  together 
before  the  mind  by  an  act  of  synthesis. 

4  This  view  is  considered  in  Chapter  X  §  5.  The  failure  to  recognise 
this  distinction  is,   I  think,  present  in  Kemp  Smith,  Commentary, 
p.  172  ff.,  although  the  main  grounds  for  the  assertions  there  made 
may  be  his  apparent  identification  of  discursive  and  analytic  thinking ; 
this  is  examined  in  Chapter  X  §  6. 

5  Kant  does  not  mean  that  in  all  conceiving  we  must  have  given 
intuitions  actually  present  to  the  mind,  but  only  that  there  is  always 
a  reference  to  some  sort  of  individual  objects  assumed  to  be  capable 
of  being  given  in  some  sort  of  intuition.  No  doubt  we   can  use  a 
concept  after  it  is  made,  but  the  act  of  thinking  any  concept  would 
seem  to  be  akin  in  certain  essential  respects  to  the  original  act  by 
which  the  concept  (that  is,  the  form  of  the  concept)  is  made. 

6  A  concept  is  regarded  by  Kant  as  essentially  the  predicate  of  a 
VOL.  I  a* 


202        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [IX  §  6 

so  far  as  it  is  thinking  by  means  of  concepts,1  is  itself  an  act 
of  conceiving.2  For  Kant  conceiving  and  judging  are  insepar- 
able. As  he  himself  says,  all  the  activities  of  the  understanding 
can  be  reduced  to  judgement.3  If  this  is  true,  it  follows  that 
an  act  of  analysts,  and  what  he  obscurely  calls  'the  analytic 
unity  of  consciousness',  must  be  present  in  every  judgement.* 
To  these  difficult  topics  we  shall  have  to  return  later.6 

There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  Kant  ever  abandoned 
the  doctrines  which  have  been  here  set  forth,  nor  is  there  any 
good  ground,  so  far  as  I  can  see,  for  holding  that  they  are 
inconsistent  with  the  Critical  Philosophy.  The  account  of  the 
concept  given  by  Formal  Logic  does  indeed  ignore  the  possi- 
bilty  that  concepts  may  be  of  fundamentally  different  kinds, 
in  so  far  as  it  ignores  all  questions  as  to  the  origin  of  their 
matter.6  It  also  ignores  the  fact  that  the  analysis  of  which  it 
speaks  presupposes  an  act  of  synthesis  as  its  condition,  and 
in  this  act  of  synthesis  concepts,  and  even  judgements,  already 
play  their  part.  These  points  are  discussed  by  Kant  in  his 
Transcendental  Logic,  and  they  may  suggest  that  a  logic 
restricted  to  bare  form  must  be  inadequate  and  even  superficial. 
This  does  not,  however,  imply  that  the  account  given  by 
Formal  Logic  is  untrue. 

One  more  point  must  be  noted.  It  may  be  thought  that 

possible  judgement ;  see  A  69  =  B  94.  That  is  to  say,  a  concept  is 
a  concept  only  in  virtue  of  being  applied,  however  vaguely,  to  a 
plurality  of  supposed  objects. 

1  'In  every  judgement  there  is  a  concept  which  is  applicable  (gilt) 
to  many  ideas,  and  comprehends  (begreift)  among  these  a  given  idea 
which  is  immediately  related  to  an  object.'  See  A  68  =  B  93. 

2  Compare  Kant's  difficult  definition  of  judgement.  'A  judgement 
is  the  representation  (Vorstellung)  of  the  unity  of  consciousness  of 
different  ideas  (Vorstellungeri),  or  the  representation  of  the  relation 
of  these  ideas  so  far  as  they  constitute  a  concept.'    See  Log.  §  17 
(IX  101). 

3  See  A  69  =  B  94  and  compare  A  126.  To  conceive  is  to  make  a 
problematic  judgement ;  to  reason  is  to  make  an  apodeictic  judgement 
(see  A  75  n.  =  B  100  n.).  4  Compare  A  79  =  B  105. 

5  See  Chapter  XII  §  5  and  Chapter  XIV  §  6. 

6  Kant's  own  Formal  Logic  treats  of  this,  as  of  other  topics  proper 
to  Transcendental  Logic. 


IX  §  6]  FORMAL  LOGIC  203 

in  his  discussion  of  the  form  of  the  concept  Kant  is  concerned 
with  the  form  of  conceiving  rather  than  with  the  form  of  the 
concept.1  I  have  no  wish  to  minimise  the  difficulties  of  his 
doctrine,  and  I  do  not  altogether  like  the  statement  that  we 
make  concepts  (as  regards  their  form)  out  of  given  intuitions. 
It  is  clear  enough  that  his  view  is  not  so  simple  as  the  view 
of  Berkeley — that  in  conceiving  we  merely  use  one  intuition 
to  stand  for  others  of  the  same  kind;  for  Kant  clearly  holds 
that  in  conceiving  we  are  concerned  with  what  is  common 
to  different  intuitions.  Nevertheless  one  has  at  times  the 
uneasy  feeling  that  he  looks  upon  what  is  common  as  itself 
an  individual  intuition  which  receives  its  universality  by  being 
referred  to  many  different  objects  as  their  'mark'.2  His  doctrine 
may  possibly  be  bound  up  with  his  own  idealistic  theory, 
which  at  this  stage  it  ought  not  to  be ;  but  so  far  as  I  can  find 
any  positive  evidence,  he  regards  it  as  following  from  the  fact 
that  the  logic  with  which  he  is  at  present  concerned  is  formal. 
He  gives  this  as  the  reason  why  Formal  Logic  must  consider 
the  concept  subjectively  \  that  is,  must  consider,  'not  how  the 
concept  determines  an  object  through  a  mark,  but  only  how 
it  can  be  referred  to  a  plurality  of  objects'.3  This  would  seem 
to  imply  that  the  concept  can  be  considered  objectively  only 
by  a  Transcendental  Logic  which  does  not  entirely  ignore  all 
differences  in  the  matter  of  concepts.4 

1  The  ambiguity  which  we  have  pointed  out  in  the  word  'intuition* 
(see  Chapter  IV  §  2)  is  to  some  extent  avoided  in  treating  conception 
because  we  commonly  use  the  word  'concept*  for  the  conceptum  and 
the  word  'conception'  for  the  act  of  conceiving;  but  'conception* 
itself  can  be  used  in  two  senses. 

2  Anyone  brought  up  on  Plato  tends  to  regard  the  concept  (or  the 
conceptum)  as  universal  in  itself:  what  we  conceive  is  a  common  or 
universal  'Form*  which  is  really  present  in  its  different  instances. 
But  the  whole  question  is  full  of  difficulties. 

3  Log.  §  5  Anmerk.  i  (IX  94). 

4  I  am  not  sure  that  I  see  why  this  should  be  so.  Kant  may  mean 
that  to  understand  how  the  concept  determines  an  object  through  a 
mark  we  must  understand  how  every  object,  as  is  proved  in  Trans- 
cendental Logic,  must  be  a  substance  with  attributes;  we  must,  in 
short,  understand  what  an  object  is,  and  this  enquiry  belongs  only  to 
Transcendental  Logic. 


CHAPTER    X 
FORMAL  LOGIC  (continued) 

§  i.  The  Farms  of  Judgement 

The  most  important  part  of  Formal  Logic  for  the  Kantian 
philosophy  is  the  section  on  the  forms  of  judgement,  for  on 
this  is  based  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  of  the  Categories. 

The  classification  of  the  forms  (or  functions1)  of  judgement, 
which  Kant  attributes  to  Formal  Logic,  is  as  follows  :2 

Judgements  are  divided,  according  to  quantity,  into  uni- 
versal, particular,  and  singular;  according  to  quality,  into 
affirmative,  negative,  and  infinite;  according  to  relation,  into 
categorical,  hypothetical,  and  disjunctive ;  according  to  modality, 
into  problematic,  assertoric,  and  apodeictic. 

From  the  point  of  view  of  Formal  Logic  this  is  a  good 
classification.  It  is  identical  with  the  list  of  forms  which 
Mr.  Joseph3  asserts  'has  for  long  been  commonly  accepted* — 
with  one  exception,  the  so-called  infinite  judgement  ;4  and  even 
this  has  a  respectable  pedigree,  going  back  to  Aristotle 
himself.6 

I  see  no  reason  to  object  to  Kant's  list  on  the  ground  that 
under  the  head  of  relation  he  places  simple  and  complex 
judgements,6  and  ignores  copulative7  judgements  as  a  variety 
of  the  complex.  The  modern  tendency  to  recognise  the  copula- 
tive judgement  may  have  utility  in  mathematical  logic,  but  for 

1  In  this  context  'form'  and  'function*  are  used  interchangeably. 
'Function*  seems  to  be  the  'form*  of  an  activity,  and  is  never,  I  believe, 
used  for  the  form  of  a  passivity  or  receptivity  (such  as  sense).

5  It  is  also  recognised  in  the  Logik  of  Baumgarten. 

6  Kant  does  not  allude  to  this  distinction  in  his  Logik,  but  he  explicitly 
rejects  the  view  that  hypothetical  and  disjunctive  judgements  can  be 
reduced  to  categorical  judgements;  see  Log.  §  24  Anmeik.  (IX  105).

X  §  i]  FORMAL  LOGIC  205 

Formal  Logic  it  is  not  strictly  a  form  of  judgement,  and  may 
be  said  to  belong  to  grammar  rather  than  to  logic.1 

Nevertheless  there  are  difficulties  in  the  list,  even  for  the 
least  carping  of  critics.  Kant's  own  discussion  suggests  doubt 
whether  his  list  is  strictly  compatible  with  a  logic  which  pro- 
fesses to  ignore  content  or  matter,  and  to  concern  itself  solely 
with  form. 

The  singular  judgement  is  added  to  the  universal  and 
particular  judgements,  because  if  we  consider,  not  its  use  in  the 
syllogism,  but  its  quantity,  it  deserves  a  special  position.2 
This  is  true,  but  we  must  ask  whether  such  consideration 
of  quantity  is  not  a  consideration  of  content. 

Again,  the  infinite  judgement  is  added  to  the  affirmative  and 
negative  judgements,  because  we  consider  its  worth  or  content.3 
Kant  even  ascribes  its  inclusion,  no  longer  to  Formal,  but 
to  Transcendental,  Logic;4  and  the  reason  given  for  its  in- 
clusion is  that  the  function  of  the  understanding  in  such 
judgements  might  be  of  importance  in  the  field  of  pure  a  priori 
cognition.  For  Formal  Logic  such  a  reason  would  be  irrelevant. 
Finally  we  are  told  that  the  modality  of  judgements  is 
peculiar  in  the  fact  that  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  content 
of  the  judgement,  and  that  quantity,  quality,  and  relation 
actually  constitute  the  content  of  a  judgement.5 

It  would  be  unfair  to  press  the  last  point  unduly  against 
Kant,  but  his  language  is  unfortunate.  He  does  not  mean  that 
quantity,  quality,  and  relation,  like  triangles  and  vertebrates, 
are  to  be  found  in  some  judgements  and  not  in  others.  He 
means  that  they  are  concerned  with  the  way  in  which  the 
constituents  of  a  judgement  must  be  combined,  while  the 
distinctions  of  the  possible,  the  actual,  and  the  necessary  are

may  vary  irrespectively  of  the  way  in  which  its  constituents

are  combined.1  Nevertheless  his  discussion  shows  that  the 
whole  question  of  the  relation  of  form  and  matter  in  judgement 
is  in  need  of  a  closer  examination  than  he  has  given  it. 

§  2.  Are  the  Forms  of  Judgement  Universal  and  Necessary  ? 

In  regard  to  the  forms  of  judgement  the  same  difficulty 
encounters  us  which  we  have  already  met  in  connexion  with 
the  forms  of  intuition.  Are  the  forms  of  judgement  strictly 
universal  and  necessary?  Are  they  forms  of  all  judgement, 
or  merely  of  some  ?  It  is  only  in  the  former  case  that  they  can 
supply  a  basis  for  Kant's  further  argument. 

Every  judgement  for  Kant  brings  given  cognitions  to  the 
objective  unity  of  apperception.2  More  simply,  it  asserts  an 
objective  connexion  between  cognitions,  not  a  mere  subjective 
connexion  in  our  minds,  such  as  is  made  by  the  association 
of  ideas.8 

The  term  'cognition'  is  here  used  in  place  of  the  term  'con- 
cept' in  order  to  cover  hypothetical  and  disjunctive,  as  well 
as  categorical,  judgements. 

The  matter  of  judgements  is  the  cognitions  so  connected ; 
the  form  is  the  way  in  which  they  are  connected,  and  is  supposed 
to  be  independent  of  the  particular  matter  involved.4 

1  Log.  §  30  (IX  1 08).  If  we  take  the  constituents  of  the  categorical 
judgement  to  be  subject  and  predicate,  the  difference  in  quantity 
and  quality  depends  on  the  way  in  which  the  subject  and  predicate 
are  combined,  and  not  on  differences  of  content  in  the  subject- 
concept  and  the  predicate-concept:  but  however  the  subject  and 
predicate  may  be  combined,  the  whole  judgement  may  be  thought 
problematically,  assertorically  or  apodeictically,  the  content  of  the 
whole  judgement  being  the  same  in  each  case.  In  this  sense  differences 
in  quantity  and  quality — and  also  differences  in  relation — may  be 
said   to   concern   differences   in   the   content  of  the  judgement  as 
differences  in  modality  do  not.  These  differences  in  content  might 
perhaps   be   called  differences   in  formal,   as   opposed  to  material, 
content.

4  A  266  =  B  322 ;  Log.  §  1 8  (IX  101).  We  may  note  without  discussion 
that  the  form  in  categorical  judgements  is  said  to  be  the  copula,  in 
hypothetical  judgements  to  be  the  'consequence',  in  disjunctive  judge- 


X§2]  FORMAL  LOGIC  207 

It  is  noteworthy  that  Kant  habitually  speaks  as  if  there  were 
one  ultimate  form  of  judgement,  which  differentiates  itself 
into  several  forms.  Thus  the  'function"  or  farm  of  thought 
is  brought  under  four  'heads',  each  of  which  contains  three 
'moments',1  and  this  gives  us  the  table  of  the  logical  functions 
of  forms  of  thought.2 

The  ultimate  form  of  thought  is  for  Kant  the  unity  of 
apperception,3  the  'I  think*  which  necessarily  accompanies 
all  our  ideas  of  objects.4  The  crucial  question  for  us  is  why 
this  ultimate  form  of  all  thought  should  be  supposed  to  differ- 
entiate itself,  independently  of  the  given  matter,  into  twelve 
forms  of  judgement,  no  more  and  no  less.  Was  Kani's  reason 
merely  the  acceptance  of  a  tradition  and  the  analogy  of  the 
syllogism,  which  does  differentiate  itself  a  priori  into  a  definite 
number  of  figures  ? 

On  this  subject  Kant  is  so  confident  that  he  gives  little  more 
than  hints  to  guide  us,  and  even  these  are  complicated  by  the 
fact  that  he  always  has  his  own  transcendental  theories  at  the 
back  of  his  mind.5  It  would  be  tedious,  and  perhaps  unprofit- 
able, to  examine  them  in  detail  here:  a  man  does  not  usually 
give  satisfactory  reasons  for  the  truth  of  a  belief  which  he  has 
not  seriously  questioned.  Nevertheless  it  is  desirable  to  con- 
sider whether  there  is  any  general  plausibility  in  the  doctrine, 
provided  we  do  not  scrutinise  it  too  carefully. 

Kant  sometimes  speaks  as  if  there  were  only  four  forms  of 
judgement;6  and  it  might  be  argued  that  every  judgement 
must  have  quantity,  quality,  relation,  and  modality.  If  we 
could  only  stop  there,  there  would  be  little  difficulty  in  main- 
taining that  Kant's  forms  are,  as  they  ought  to  be,  strictly 

ments  to  be  the  disjunction;  Log.  §§  24,  25,  28  (IX  105  and  106).  In 
syllogisms  the  matter  is  the  premises,  the  form  is  the  conclusion  so 
far  as  it  contains  the  Consequence';  Log  §  59  (IX  121).  The  *  conse- 
quence' is  of  course  to  be  distinguished  from  the  *  consequent*.

universal.  The  difficulty  arises  in  connexion  with  the  three 
'moments'  which  are  to  be  found  under  each  of  the  four 
main  'forms'. 

These  moments  are,  from  the  point  of  view  of  ordinary 
Formal  Logic,  alternatives ;  and  the  utmost  that  Formal  Logic 
could  do  would  be  to  show  that  they,  and  they  alone,  are 
necessary  alternatives.  By  the  exercise  of  ingenuity  we  might 
perhaps  find  in  these  divisions  enough  show  of  intelligible 
necessity  to  explain  how  Kant,  under  the  influence  of  tradition 
and  analogy,  could  accept  the  list  as  complete;  but  there 
appears  to  be  no  single  principle  of  division  such  as  he  assumes 
must  be  discoverable  from  the  nature  of  the  understanding 
as  an  absolute  unity.1  There  is  on  the  contrary  a  departure, 
although  not  a  departure  without  precedent,  from  the  ideals 
of  Formal  Logic  itself.2 

It  is  a  curious  fact  that  Kant  should  help  us  so  little  about 
the  principle  of  his  division,  especially  in  view  of  his  interest 
in  such  topics,  and  in  view  of  the  oddness  of  the  division 
itself,  with  its  four  main  forms  and  its  three  subordinate 
moments.  It  is  also  curious  that  he  should  assume  without 
question  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  forms  of  thought,  when 
he  has  made  so  much  difficulty  in  regard  to  a  priori  knowledge 
of  the  forms  of  intuition;  and  it  is  all  the  more  curious  because 
our  a  priori  knowledge  in  Logic  is  presumably  conceptual 
rather  than  intuitional.  He  may  have  thought  that  it  is  natural 
to  have  conceptual  knowledge  of  an  activity  which  is  itself 
conceptual,  or  that  we  have  some  special  insight  into  the 
nature  of  our  own  activities,  such  as  we  never  could  have 
in  regard  to  things  given  us  from  without ;  but  the  question 
is  clearly  in  need  of  discussion,  and  so  far  as  I  am  aware, 
it  is  never  even  discussed. 


1 A  67  =  B  92. 

1  This  is  most  obvious  in  the  case  of  singular  and  infinite  judge- 
ments, since  the  singular  judgement  takes  into  account  the  particular 
nature  of  the  subject,  and  the  infinite  judgement  takes  into  account 
the  particular  nature  of  the  predicate.  Compare  Log.  §§  21  Anmerk.  i 
and  22  Anmerk.  1-3  (IX  102  and  104). 


X  §  si  FORMAL  LOGIC  209 

§  3.  Kant's  Central  Argument 

With  the  best  will  in  the  world  we  cannot  justify,  though 
perhaps  we  can  excuse,  Kant's  belief  in  the  necessity  and 
completeness  of  his  list  of  forms.  It  is,  however,  all-important 
to  understand  precisely  what  Kant  imagined  himself  to  have 
found  in  this  list;  for  only  so  can  we  follow  his  argument 
about  the  categories,  and  see  the  irrelevance  of  some  of  the 
criticisms  commonly  brought  against  him. 

The  essential  point  of  his  appeal  to  Formal  Logic  on  this 
matter  is  that  we  are  supposed  to  have  here  a  complete  and 
necessary  list  of  the  forms  of  judgement  which  are  wholly 
independent  of  the  particular  nature  of  the  objects  judged.  If  this 
were  true,  and  if,  further,  nothing  could  be  an  object  of  experi- 
ence without  being  judged,  then  every  object  of  experience 
must  be  capable  of  being  judged  under  all  these  necessary  forms 
of  judgement. 

This  is,  as  it  seems  to  me,  the  very  crux  and  centre  of  Kant's 
argument,  so  far  as  it  depends  upon  Formal  Logic;  and  if  his 
premises  were  true,  as  all  the  world  at  the  time  believed  them 
to  be  true,1  his  conclusions  might  seem  to  have  the  apodeictic 
certainty  which  he  claimed,  instead  of  being  dismissed  lightly 
as  ingenious  pedantry. 

§  4.  Some  Criticisms 

In  the  light  of  this  assumption  it  is  also  possible  to  see 
Kant's  answer  to  complaints  that  he  has  failed  to  recognise 
distinctions  emphasised  by  modern  logic.  On  his  view  these 
distinctions  are  concerned,  not  with  the  form,  but  with  the 
matter,  of  judgement. 

Thus,  to  take  a  definite  instance,  Kant  has  been  criticised 
for  not  recognising  the  difference  between  merely  enumerative 
and  truly  universal  propositions.  Kant  does  recognise  a  differ- 
ence between  general  propositions  (derived  from  induction) 
and  strictly  universal  propositions2;  but,  as  he  says,  this  is 

1  See,  for  example,  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  474  n.). 

2  Log.  §  84  Anmerk.  ^  (IX  133);  compare  A  91  =  B  124;  A  300 
=  B  356;  and  Grundlegung  (IV  424). 


a io        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC      [X  §  4 

no  concern  of  Formal  Logic.1  It  is  not  a  difference  in  the 
form  of  the  judgement,  but  depends  on  the  particular  nature 
of  the  matter  judged. 

It  is  equally  obvious  that  the  kinds  of  proposition  dis- 
tinguished so  emphatically  by  mathematical  logic — as  for 
example,  the  subject-predicate,  class-membership,  and  re- 
lational propositions2 — would  for  Kant,  and  indeed  for  any 
formal  logician  of  the  old  school,  be  distinguished  by  their 
matter,  and  not  by  their  form.3  It  is  important  to  recognise 
this  fact,  because  although  mathematical  logic,  like  Kant's 
Formal  Logic,  claims  to  be  a  science  of  pure  form,4  it  uses  the 
word  'form*  in  a  different,  although  allied,  sense. 

For  mathematical  logic  the  form  of  a  proposition  is  what 
remains  unchanged,  although  all  the  constituents  of  the 
proposition  are  altered.5  For  Kant  there  can  be  no  pure  form 
of  a  proposition,  unless  every  possible  constituent  of  a  proposi- 
tion can  be  fitted  into  it.  Thus  he  would  not  regard  'A  =  B' 
as  a  form  of  judgement,  because  although  many  different 
terms  may  be  substituted  for  A  and  B,  all  these  terms  must 
be  quantities;  that  is,  they  must  refer  to  a  certain  kind  of 
object,  while  a  pure  form  must  apply  to  every  possible  kind 
of  object.  Hence  to  complain  that  Kant  did  not  consider,  for 
example,  relational  propositions,  it  is  to  misunderstand  what 
he  was  trying  to  do. 

I  do  not  suggest  that  there  is  any  necessary  antagonism 
between  Kant's  point  of  view  and  that  of  mathematical  logic. 
On  the  contrary,  it  is  no  part  of  Kant's  case  that  Formal 
Logic  is  a  sufficient  account  of  all  reasoning.  He  believes  it  to 
be  true  so  far  as  it  goes,  but  he  maintains,  for  example,  that 
it  cannot  account  for  the  special  characteristics  of  mathematical 

1  Log.  §21  Anmerk.  2  (IX  102).  I  am  assuming  that  he  uses  the 
words  in  the  same  sense  in  §§  21  and  84.  Although  this  distinction 
makes  a  great  difference  in  the  value  of  a  syllogism,  it  does  not,  I 
think,  affect  its  validity  from  a  purely  formal  point  of  view. 

2  Stebbing,  Logic,  p.  45. 

3  Or  by  a  form  which  depended  on  the  matter — a  particular  and 
not  a  universal  form. 

4  Stebbing,  Logic,  p.  163.  6  Ibid.  p.  126. 


X  §s]  FORMAL  LOGIC  211 

reasoning.  The  modern  study  of  relations  in  logic  may  be 
regarded  as  a  development  of  his  view  that  mathematical 
thinking  depends,  not  on  the  form  of  the  syllogism,  but  on 
specific  spatial  and  temporal  relations. 

It  must  nevertheless  be  recognised  that  Kant's  Formal 
Logic  and  modern  mathematical  logic  are  trying  to  do  different 
things,  and  the  criticism  that  Kant  ought  to  have  done  what 
mathematical  logic  does  is  an  unreasonable  criticism. 

§  5.  Kant s  Ideal 

Criticisms  of  this  type,  although,  as  I  believe,  mistaken, 
raise  a  more  fundamental  question.  Is  not  Kant's  ideal  in 
itself  impossible?  Can  we  discover  universal  and  necessary 
forms  of  thought  in  entire  abstraction  from  the  different  kinds 
of  subject-matter?  Are  we  not  bound  to  take  some  account 
of  the  subject-matter,  as  Kant  does  himself,  or  else  to  be  left, 
not  with  a  form  of  thought,  but  with  a  mere  form  of  words  ? 

This  is  a  difficult  question  which  we  can  hardly  attempt 
to  discuss  here.  There  are  indications  in  Kant  of  a  tendency 
to  move  beyond  the  verbal  distinctions,  and  the  mutually 
exclusive  forms  of  judgement,  offered  us  by  Formal  Logic,  and 
to  consider  the  forms  of  judgement  as  'moments'  present  in  all 
thinking  without  exception.  This  interpretation  is  suggested 
partly  by  the  use  of  the  word  'moment';1  partly  by  the  three- 
fold division  which  implies  (i)  a  condition,  (2)  a  conditioned, 
and  (3)  that  which  arises  from  the  union  of  the  two;2  and 
partly  by  the  treatment  of  the  categories  which  are  derived 
from  the  forms  of  judgement.  If  we  could  take  this  as  repre- 
senting Kant's  thought  at  its  best,  the  mutually  exclusive 
forms  recognised  by  Formal  Logic  would  have  to  be  regarded 

1  In  A  70  =  B  95  *  moment'  is  applied  only  to  the  three  subordinate 
forms  under  each  of  the  four  main  heads.  In  Prol.  §21  (IV  302)  all 
the  forms  of  judgment  are  treated  as  'moments' ;  compare  also  Log. 
§  20  (IX  102)  and  Prol.  §  20  (IV  302  n.). 

*  See  Log.  §  113  (IX  147-8);  and  compare  K.d.U.  EM.  (V  197  n.) 
and  Nachlass  3067  (XVI  639).  A  fuller  statement  will  be  found  in 
Chapter  XV  §  2. 


212         FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [X§5 

as  merely  stressing  aspects  or  moments  of  thought  present 
necessarily  in  all  judgement. 

This  is  not  such  an  impossible  suggestion  as  might  appear 
at  first  sight.  It  might  be  argued  that  every  judgement  (as 
involving  conception)  is  concerned  with  a  plurality  of  singular 
individuals  considered  as  a  totality,  and  this  is,  I  believe, 
Kant's  own  doctrine.1  Again,  it  might  be  argued  that  every 
judgement — if  we  consider  it  as  a  concrete  act  and  not  merely 
as  an  abstract  proposition — denies  in  affirming  and  affirms 
in  denying,  and  so  necessarily  delimits:2  of  this  view  also 
there  are  indications  in  Kant.  Categorical,  hypothetical,  and 
disjunctive  judgements  he  appears  to  regard  always  as  alter- 
natives :3  but  even  here  it  might  be  argued  that  every  judge- 
ment, so  far  as  it  is  an  assertion  about  reality,  is  categorical; 
that  so  far  as  it  asserts  for  a  reason,  it  does  so  subject  to  a 
condition,  and  is  hypothetical;  and  that  so  far  as  it  delimits 
a  'sphere'  or  'spheres'  within  the  whole  of  reality,  it  is  dis- 
junctive. As  to  problematic,  assertoric,  and  apodeictic  judge- 
ments, Kant  himself  appears  to  suggest  that  a  judgement 
is  problematic  so  far  as  it  accords  with  the  principle  of  non- 
contradiction ;  that  it  is  assertoric  so  far  as  it  accords  with  the 
principle  of  sufficient  ground;  and  that  it  is  apodeictic  so  far 
as  it  accords  with  the  principle  of  excluded  middle.4  If  this 
were  true,  I  take  it  that  since  all  judgements  must  conform 
with  these  laws  of  thought,  all  judgements  might  be  said  to 
contain  the  three  'moments'  of  modality. 

Even  if  we  accepted  a  view  of  this  kind,  it  would  still  remain 
necessary  for  us  to  show  why  thought  necessarily  articulates 
itself  into  just  these  'moments'  and  no  others.  Kant,  it  seems 

1  See  A  67  =  B  92  ff.  and  compare  Chapter  XII  §  5. 

2  The  infinite  judgement  may  be  said  to  recognise,  although  in  an 
artificial  way,  a  necessary  characteristic  of  all  judgement. 

8  See  B  112;  A  73  =  Bg8;  Log.  §§  60,  23,  and  27-9  (IX  121,  104, 
and  106-7). 

4  Log.  EM.  VII  (IX  52-3).  I  find  the  details  of  this  difficult  to 
understand,  but  I  think  it  is  perhaps  possible  to  hold  that  every 
judgement  must  be  logically  possible,  logically  actual,  and  logically 
necessary.  Compare  Chapters  XLIX  and  L. 


X§6]  FORMAL  LOGIC  213 

to  me,  has  manifestly  failed  to  do  this,  and  I  do  not  know 
whether  it  is  possible  to  establish  a  necessary  and  limited 
number  of  'moments'  in  thought  as  such.  Nevertheless  his 
argument  becomes  intelligible,  if  he  believed,  as  I  think  he  did, 
that  this  ideal  had  been  realised.  If  we  can  penetrate  behind 
the  formalism  in  his  expression,  we  shall  find  that  his  theory 
is  not  without  plausibility,  and  that  the  connexion  between 
the  forms  of  judgement  and  the  categories  is  very  much  more 
reasonable  than  is  commonly  supposed. 

§  6.  The  Form  of  Synthetic  Judgements 

Kant  never  varies  in  his  assertion  that  Formal  Logic  is 
concerned  with  the  form  of  thought  in  general,1  and  gives  us 
the  universal  and  necessary  rules  of  the  understanding.2  The 
form  of  thought  is  for  Kant  primarily  the  form  of  judgement, 
and  the  list  of  forms  of  judgement  gives  us  the  logical  forms3 
in  all  possible  judgements  *  As  we  have  seen,  he  regards  the  list 
as  necessarily  complete. 

In  spite  of  this,  it  is  repeated  from  commentator  to  com- 
mentator, especially  in  this  country,  that  Formal  Logic  gives 
us  the  forms  of  analytic  judgements  only,  and  not  the  forms 
of  synthetic  judgement.5  I  can  find  no  evidence  that  Kant  ever 
held  such  a  belief. 

We  must  distinguish  three  kinds  of  thinking  in  close  con- 
nexioi*  with  logic.  There  is,  firstly,  the  thinking  which  takes 
place  in  the  science  of  logic  itself;  secondly,  there  is  the  thinking 
which  takes  place  by  the  rules  of  logic  alone,  without  help 

1  A  55  -  B  79.  2  A  59  =  B  83-4. 

3  Kant  uses  the  word  'function.'  *  A  79  =  B  105. 

6  See  Mind,  Vol.  XL,  N.S.  No.  159.  This  view  is  no  doubt 
complicated  by  a  tendency  to  confuse,  or  to  classify  together, 
judgements  made  by  analysis  of  a  subject-concept  (analytic  judge- 
ments proper)  and  judgements  made  by  analysis  of  an  object.  I  seem 
to  find  it  in  Caird,  Prichard,  and  Kemp  Smith,  the  three  major 
English  commentators,  who  appear  to  be  unconscious  that  it  is  even 
in  need  of  defence.  For  some  account  of  it  in  Germany  and  a  most 
unconvincing  defence,  see  Kinkel's  introduction  to  Kant's  Logik  (Phil. 
Bib.  43).  Compare  also  England,  Kant's  Conception  of  God f,  p.  91. 


214         FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [X  §6 

from  any  other  source  (such  as  empirical  or  pure  intuition); 
and  thirdly,  there  is  the  thinking  about  which  the  logician 
thinks,  and  of  which  he  seeks  to  grasp  the  form. 

These  three  kinds  of  thinking  naturally  involve  inference 
and  conception  as  well  as  judgement.  We  are  here  concerned 
with  them  only  so  far  as  they  involve  judgement.1 

The  judgements  in  the  science  of  logic  itself  are,  as  we  have 
seen,  entirely  a  priori.  I  have  not  found  any  statement  in  Kant 
that  they  are  analytic  and  not  synthetic,  but — in  spite  of  a 
suggestion  that  the  division  of  the  forms  of  judgement  into 
three  'moments'  is  synthetic2 — I  am  prepared  to  assume  that 
they  are  all  properly  regarded  as  analytic. 

The  judgements  which  take  place  by  the  rules  of  logic  alone, 
and  the  judgements  whose  truth  is  guaranteed  by  the  rules 
of  logic  alone,  are  certainly  analytic,  and  not  synthetic.3 

It  is  mere  confusion  of  thought  to  suppose  that,  because 
these  two  kinds  of  judgement  are  analytic,  therefore  the  judge- 
ments of  which  logic  states  the  forms  must  also  be  analytic. 
A  logic  which  restricted  itself  in  this  way  would  not  be  a 
general  logic. 

The  reason  why  analytic  judgements  can  be  made  by  the 
rules  of  logic  alone  (in  particular  by  the  law  of  non-contra- 
diction) is  that  they  affect  only  the  form  of  our  cognition.4 

1 1  am  inclined  to  think  that  all  the  forms  of  judgment  are  for 
Kant  involved  in  conception  as  such  (so  far  as  conception  is 
judgement).

and  Nachlass  3067  (XVI  639).  The  mere  fact  that  logic  analyses  the 
activities  of  thought  does  not  of  itself  prove  that  the  judgements  of 
logic  are  analytic  judgements. 

3  Such  truth  is,  however,  a  very  dubious  kind  of  truth ;  it  depends 
on  the  supposition  that  there  is  an  object  corresponding  to  the 
subject-concept;  see  A  151  =  B  190-1.  This  passage  is  incidentally 
one  of  the  many  which  show  that  an  analytic  judgement  is  assumed 
to  be  about  an  object,  and  not  merely  about  a  concept.  This  is,  however, 
implied  merely  in  the  fact  that  an  analytic  judgement  can  be  true, 
since  for  Kant  truth  is  always  correspondence  with  an  object.  Compare 
also  A  736  =  B  764.

X§6]  FORMAL  LOGIC  215 

Synthetic  judgements  add  to  our  knowledge  materialiter,  not 
merely  formaliter*  and  for  this  reason  Formal  Logic  gives 
no  account  of  them,  so  far  as  they  are  synthetic.  It  does  not 
follow  from  this  that  their  form  is  not  the  form  common  to  all 
judgement,  or  that  logic  gives  no  account  of  such  a  common 
form.  I  have  yet  to  see  a  logic  which  refuses  to  admit  the 
judgement  'All  men  are  mortar.  Yet  this  is  unquestionably 
a  synthetic  judgement. 

Formal  Logic,  I  submit,  gives  an  account  of  synthetic 
judgements,  not  so  far  as  they  are  synthetic,  but  so  far  as  they 
are  judgements.2  The  forms  of  judgement  are  common  to  all 
judgements,  whatever  be  the  origin  of  their  matter;  just  as  the 
form  of  the  concept  is  common  to  all  concepts,  whatever 
be  the  origin  of  their  matter. 

What  does  the  opposite  view  mean  ?  It  means  that  synthetic 
judgements  are  neither  universal  nor  particular  nor  singular; 
neither  affirmative  nor  negative  nor  infinite ;  neither  categorical 
nor  hypothetical  nor  disjunctive;  neither  problematic  nor 
assertoric  nor  apodeictic.  That  is  to  say,  they  are  not  judge- 
ments at  all,  which  is  what  we  should  expect  of  anything  that 
does  not  share  the  form  of  judgement. 

This  view — if  we  state  it  clearly — is  nonsense,  and  a  source 
of  nonsense.3  It  ought  not  to  be  attributed  to  Kant  without 
the  most  conclusive  evidence,  and  such  evidence  seems  to  me 
to  be  lacking.  To  my  mind  it  is  a  palmary  instance  of  the  way 
in  which  Kant  is  first  misunderstood,  and  then  condemned 
for  something  which  he  has  never  said. 

1  Log.  §  36  Anmcrk.  i  (IX  in). 

2  Formal  Logic  treats  all  judgements  alike:  it  ought  not  even  to 
know  the  name  of  synthetic  judgements ;  see  A  15  =  B  193. 

3  For  example,  since  all  empirical  judgements  are  synthetic,  this 
view  implies  the  further  nonsense  that  no  empirical  judgement  partakes 
of  the  form  of  judgement.  Yet  Formal  Logic  deals  with  all  judge- 
ments, whether  their  content  be  empirical  or  pure  or  transcendental, 
since  it  ignores  these  differences.  See  A  53  =  B  77;  A  56  =  B  80; 
A  57  -  B  82,  etc.

§  7.  Discursive  and  Analytic  Thinking 

Although  there  is,  so  far  as  I  can  see,  no  evidence  for  the 
view  that  Formal  Logic,  either  in  the  eyes  of  Kant  or  of  any 
of  his  contemporaries,  gives  us  the  forms  of  analytic  judge- 
ments only,  there  are  a  number  of  statements  which  have 
been  taken  as  offering  such  evidence.  These  I  have  examined 
elsewhere.1 1  can  deal  here  only  with  the  most  important  of 
them. 

Formal  Logic  is  for  Kant  the  logic  of  discursive  thought,  and 
discursive  thought  is  sometimes  supposed  to  be  identical  with 
analytic  thought.2  This  is  an  error. 

The  word  'discursive'  is  equivalent  to  'conceptual',  and 
is  opposed  to  'intuitive'.3  'Cognition  through  concepts  is  called 
thought  (cognitio  discursiva)* *  All  human,  and  indeed  all  finite  > 

1  Mind,  Vol.  XL,  N.S.  No.  159.  See  also  Chapter  IX  §  6. 

2  Professor  Kemp  Smith  habitually  identifies  discursive  thinking 
with  analytic  thinking,  and  opposes  it  to  synthetic  thinking.  See,  for 
example,  Commentary,  pp.  176  ff. 

3  Since  in  human  beings  intuition  alone  is  immediate  (as  well  as 
passive  and  singular),  this  should  be  taken  to  imply  that  discursive 
thought  is  mediate  (as  well  as  active  and  general).  Discursive  thought 
would  seem  to  be  mediate  in  the  sense  that  it  is  a  means  to  intuition 
(see  A  19  =  B  33) ;  or  perhaps  better  in  the  sense  that  it  is  not  related 
immediately  to  its  object,  but  is  related  (in  the  last  resort)  to  an 
intuition  which  alone  is  in  immediate  relation  to  an  object  (see  A  68 
=  B  93).  More  simply,  discursive  thought  is  about  an  object  given 
immediately  to  a  passive  intuition  (intuition  is  of  its  object,  and  not 
about  it). 

I  have  found  no  clear  account  of  the  history  of  the  word  'discursive*, 
but  it  appears  to  have  developed  from  Plato's  distinction  between 
tiidvoia  and  vorjaiG  in  the  Republic.  'Discursive'  is  equivalent  to  'con- 
ceptual* only  so  far  as  conception  is  mediate.  A  power  of  intuitive 
conception,  if  we  possessed  it,  would  not  manifest  itself  in  dis- 
cursive thinking. 

On  this  topic,  compare  Muirhead,  Coleridge  as  Philosopher,  p.  65. 

4  Log.  §  i  (IX  91).  Compare  A  68  =  B  93,  where  cognition  through 
concepts  is  said  to  be  'not  intuitive  but  discursive';  and  A  XVII- 
XVIII,  where  discursive 'distinctness*  is  through  concepts,  and  intuitive 
'distinctness'  is  through  intuition.  In  Log.  Einl.  V  (IX  36)  the  difference 
between  intuitive  and  discursive  cognitions  is  the  same  as  the  difference 
between  intuitions  and  concepts.  See  also  Log.  Einl.  VIII  (IX  58) 
and  A  230  =  B  283. 


X§7]  FORMAL  LOGIC  217 

thinking,  since  it  is  conceptual,  is  necessarily  discursive.  Human 
beings  have  no  way  of  obtaining  intuitions  apart  from  passive 
sensibility,1  and  do  not  possess  intuitive  understanding2  or 
intellectual  intuition.3  That  is  to  say,  human  beings  can  only 
think,  by  means  of  general  concepts,  about  individual  objects 
given  immediately  in  sensuous  intuition ;  and  apart  from  what 
is  given  in  sensuous  intuition,  their  thoughts  or  concepts  would 
have  no  reference  to  any  determinate  object.4  This  would 
apparently  not  be  true  of  a  being  which  possessed  intuitive 
understanding:  for  such  a  being,  objects  would  be  given  or 
produced  in  the  very  act  of  cognition  itself.5 

Knowledge  is  to  be  distinguished  from  mere  thinking,  since 
it  involves  both  thought  and  intuition.8  In  the  Kritik  Kant 
goes  so  far  as  to  say  that  all  knowledge  yielded  by  human 
understanding,  since  it  is  through  concepts,  is  not  intuitive 
but  discursive.7  More  correctly,  knowledge  involves  for  human

8  B  68  and  B  159.  An  intellectual  intuition  would  be  immediate, 
but  active  or  spontaneous  like  thought:  a  sensuous  intuition  is 
immediate,  but  passive  or  receptive.  Intellectual  intuition  apparently 
could  not  belong  to  any  kind  of  dependent  finite  being,  but  only  to 
a  self-sufficient  primordial  being  (Urweseri)\  see  B  72.  I  presume  that 
the  sole  object  of  such  a  being  would  be  its  own  acts  of  cognition: 
its  knowledge  would  be  vdrjau;  votfaeox;  (see  B  145).

6  B  145.  I  do  not  know  whether  this  is  the  reason  why  Professor 
Kemp  Smith  opposes  *  discursive'  thinking,  not  only  to  Synthetic*, 
but  also  to  Creative'  thinking  (see,  for  example,  Commentary,  pp. 
177-8).  Synthetic  thinking  as  such  is  not  creative:  it  depends  on 
matter  given  to  intuition.  Synthetic  thinking  by  means  of  the  cate- 
gories— even  if  it  is  alleged  to  be  pre-logical  and  unconscious — can 
have  nothing  to  do  with  that  creative  thinking  (if  it  can  be  called 
so)  which  belongs  to  an  intuitive  understanding  and  alone  is  opposed 
by  Kant  to  discursive  thinking;  for  the  categories  have  'absolutely 
no  significance*  in  connexion  with  the  cognitions  of  an  intuitive 
understanding.  Thinking  by  means  of  the  categories  is  just  as  dis- 
cursive as  thinking  by  means  of  empirical  concepts,  and  it  always 
requires  a  matter  given  to  sensuous  intuition.

beings  both  thought  and  sensuous  intuition;  that  is,  it  involves 
both  a  discursive  element  and  an  intuitive  element.1  According 
as  the  discursive  or  the  intuitive  element  is  the  more  prominent, 
we  sometimes  describe  the  whole  cognition  as  discursive 
or  intuitive.2 

Thus  mathematical  knowledge  is  often  described  as  intuitive, 
because  we  can  construct  a  priori  in  pure  intuition  objects 
corresponding  to  our  mathematical  concepts;  and  this  in- 
tuitive element  is,  for  Kant,  the  basis  of  mathematical  reason- 
ing. Philosophy,  on  the  other  hand,  is  described  as  discursive 
knowledge,  because  it  must  work  through  mere  concepts 
(although  always  in  relation  to  possible  intuition).3  This 
distinction  is  one  of  degree,  and  not  of  kind. 

All  analytic  judgements  are  discursive,4  but  it  is  a  mistake 
to  suppose  that  all  discursive  judgements  (that  is,  all  judge- 
ments in  which  the  discursive  element  is  more  prominent  than 
the  intuitive)  are  analytic.  Some  discursive  judgements  are 
certainly  synthetic.  Indeed,  so  far  as  I  can  discover,  the  only 
synthetic  judgements  which  are  called  intuitive  are  those 
of  mathematics.5 

There  can  in  any  case  be  no  doubt  whatever  that  the  syn- 
thetic principles  of  Kant's  own  philosophy  are  discursive. 
Even  the  Principle  of  the  Axioms  of  Intuition,  although  it  is 
a  synthetic  a  priori  principle,  is  not  itself  an  axiom,  but  is 
obtained  by  means  of  concepts,  and  so  is  discursive.8  And, 
as  Kant  himself  says  explicitly,  a  transcendental  proposition

4  Compare  Nachlass  3140  (XVI  675). 

5  Perhaps  this  is  because  we  construct  the  object  a  priori  in  pure 
intuition,  and  so  approximate  most  closely  to  intellectual  intuition. 

6  A  732-3  =  B  760-1.  Compare  Log.  §  36  Anmerk.  2  (IX  in). 
Synthetic  a  priori  principles  are  axioms  only  if  they  are  intuitive ; 
that  is,  if  they  possess  that  immediate  certainty  which  arises  from 
the  fact  that  we  can  construct  a  priori  in  intuition  objects  corre- 
sponding to  the  concept  employed  in  the  axiom.  This  is  possible 
only  in  mathematics.  The  contrast  between  discursive  and  intuitive 
knowledge  is  a  contrast  between  philosophy  and  mathematics. 


X  §  8]  FORMAL  LOGIC  219 

is  synthetic  knowledge,  through  reason,  in  accordance  with 
mere  concepts ;  and  it  is  discursive.1 

One  example  of  this  kind  is  enough  to  show  that  the  analytic 
and  the  discursive  are  not  identical.  Hence  the  fact  that  Formal 
Logic  is  concerned  with  the  torms  of  discursive  thinking  gives 
not  the  slightest  warrant  for  asserting  that  these  forms  are  the 
forms  of  analytic  judgement  alone  ;2  and  it  is  altogether  un- 
Kantian  to  oppose  discursive  and  synthetic  thinking  to  one 
another. 

So  far  as  I  can  see,  the  doctrine  of  Kant  on  this  matter 
is  clear  and  consistent,  and  there  is  no  confusion  between 
Critical  and  non-Critical  theories.  From  the  point  of  view  of 
Formal  Logic  there  is  an  element  of  analysis  in  all  judgement ; 
for  all  judgement  involves  conception,  and  to  conceive  or  to 
judge  is  always  to  think  of  what  is  common  to  different  objects. 
Hence  thought  as  such  may  be  regarded,  and  properly  re- 
garded, as  involving  an  analysis  of  the  objects  about  which 
it  thinks.3  This  has  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  analytic 
judgements,  which  are  made,  not  by  analysis  of  objects,  but 
by  analysis  of  the  subject-concept.  It  seems  to  me  that  a 
confusion  between  these  two  kinds  of  analysis  is  to  be  found 
in  many  of  Kant's  critics:  it  is  never  found  in  Kant  himself. 
Furthermore  there  is  not  the  slightest  inconsistency  between 
the  doctrine  that  analysis  is  to  be  found  in  all  judgments  and 
the  doctrine  of  synthesis  to  which  we  are  about  to  be  intro- 
duced. 

§  8.  Judgement  is  Synthesis 

The  recognition  that  the  forms  of  judgement  are  the  forms 
of  all  judgement  (both  analytic  and  synthetic)  makes  a  funda- 

1 A  722  =  B  750. 

2  To  say  that  Formal  Logic  is  concerned  with  the  forms  of  dis- 
cursive thinking  is  merely  to  say  that  it  is  concerned  with  the  forms 
of  human  or  finite  or  conceptual  thinking,  a  very  harmless  observation 
indeed. 

8  Discursive  thinking  is  at  least  closely  connected  with  this  kind 
of  analysis,  and  this  connexion  may  be  one  of  the  sources  of  the 
misunderstanding  I  have  discussed. 


220       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC      [X  §  8 

mental  difference  to  our  interpretation  of  Kant's  Deduction 
of  the  Categories.  Indeed  unless  the  forms  of  judgement  are 
forms  of  synthetic,  as  well  as  of  analytic,  judgement,  the 
Deduction  is  as  arbitrary  and  unintelligible  as  it  is  commonly 
believed  to  be.  But  I  venture  to  submit  that  both  the  tortured 
efforts  to  reduce  Kant  to  sense,  and  the  crushing  demon- 
strations of  his  failure  to  grasp  the  implications  of  his  own 
argument,  rest  alike  upon  what  Kant  would  describe  as  a  mere 
Hirngesptnst*  so  far  as  they  depend  upon  the  supposition  that 
the  forms  of  judgement  belong  to  analytic  judgements  alone. 

I  will  go  farther,  and  insist  that  for  Kant  there  is  an  element 
of  synthesis  in  every  judgement,  and  indeed  in  every  form 
of  judgement.  This  explains  (what  to  so  many  is  unintelligible) 
how  Kant  could  think  that  the  forms  of  judgement  are  the 
source  of  the  categories,  which  are  principles  of  synthesis. 

This  point  will  be  made  clearer  as  we  examine  Kant's 
argument  in  detail.  It  is,  however,  implied  even  in  his  definition 
of  judgement  as  *a  way  of  bringing  given  cognitions  to  the 
objective  unity  of  apperception';2  for  the  objective  unity 
of  apperception  is  that  through  which  the  given  manifold 
is  united  in  the  concept  of  an  object.3  In  the  logical  functions 
(that  is,  forms)  of  judgement  combination,  and  therefore  unity 
of  given  concepts,  is  already  thought.4  This  'combination' 
is  identified  with  synthesis,  and  is  defined  as  'representation 
of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold'.5  This  synthesis,  Kant 
insists,  is  present  even  where  the  judgements  are  analytic,  the 
distinction  between  analytic  and  synthetic  judgements  being 
here  irrelevant.6 

In  the  Prolegomena'  Kant  is  equally  clear.  To  think  is  to 
uniffi  ideas  in  one  consciousness,  and  this  unification  of  ideas 
in  one  consciousness  is  judgement.  The  logical  moments 
(or  forms)  of  all  judgement  are  so  many  ways  of  unifying  ideas

in  one  consciousness.1  When  these  logical  moments  (or  forms) 
serve  as  concepts  (that  is,  as  categories),  they  are  concepts 
of  the  necessary  unification  of  ideas  in  one  consciousness.  This 
unification  is  either  analytic  (through  identity)  or  synthetic 
(through  the  adding  of  one  idea  to  another). 

From  these  passages  and  others2  it  is  clear  that  for  Kant 
every  judgement  (whether  it  be  classified  as  analytic  or  syn- 
thetic) involves  a  synthesis,  and  that  this  synthesis  is  thought 
in  the  very  form  of  the  judgement  itself.3  Every  categorical 
judgement,  for  example,  involves  a  synthesis  of  subject  and 
predicate,  and  in  this  connexion  it  is  irrelevant  whether  the 
predicate  can  be  obtained  by  analysis  from  the  subject-concept 
or  not.  This  truth,  which  Kant  has  been  so  often  blamed  for 
failing  to  see,  is  an  essential  part  of  his  argument,  a  fact  familiar 
to  a  contemporary  commentator  like  Mellin,4  though  too  often 
forgotten  to-day;  and  I  believe  it  to  be  the  key  to  the  whole 
elaborate  Deduction  of  the  Categories,  both  Metaphysical  and 
Transcendental,  which  it  will  shortly  be  our  business  to 
consider.

8  It  is  also,  I  think,  clear  that  the  synthesis  is  a  synthesis,  not  only 
of  concepts,  but  of  a  manifold  thought  by  their  means.

CHAPTER    XI 
TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC 

§  i .  Transcendental  and  Formal  Logic 

In  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic  we  examined  sensibility 
by  itself,  and  discovered  that  the  a  priori  elements  contributed 
to  knowledge  by  sensibility  were  space  and  time.  In  the  Tran- 
scendental Logic  we  must  similarly  examine  understanding, 
and  try  to  discover  what,  if  any,  are  the  a  priori  elements 
contributed  to  knowledge  by  thought. 

It  is  important  to  distinguish  Transcendental  Logic  from 
Formal  Logic,  and  the  difference  is  to  be  found  in  two  main 
points. 

The  first  point  is  this.  Formal  Logic  is  concerned  with  the 
necessary  rules,  or  the  necessary  form,  of  all  thinking,  whether 
empirical  or  pure,  whether  analytic  or  synthetic.  Transcen- 
dental Logic,  on  the  other  hand,  studies,  and  studies  only, 
the  rules  of  synthetic  a  priori  thinking* 

This  means  that  Transcendental  Logic  does  not,  like  Formal 
Logic,  abstract  entirely  from  the  content  or  matter  of  thought. 
Synthetic  a  priori  thinking  is  impossible  apart  from  pure 
intuition.  Hence  Transcendental  Logic  excludes  from  its 
consideration  cognitions  so  far  as  their  content  is  merely 
empirical;  but  without  the  pure  manifold  of  space  and  time, 
as  set  forth  in  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic,  the  a  priori 
element  contributed  by  thought  would  be  empty.2 

1  A  55  =  B  80;  A  154  =  B  193.  More  exactly,  it  studies  the  concepts 
and  principles  of  synthetic  a  priori  thinking. 

2  A  55  =  B  79-80;  A76-7  =  B  102 ;  A  155  =  B  194.  To  be  'empty' 
is  to  be  without  objective  reference  or  validity.  The  first  passage 
seems  to  me  to  state  that  because  there  are  pure  as  well  as  empirical 
intuitions,  it  might  be  possible  to  find  a  difference  between  pure  and 
empirical  thought  of  objects.  This  is  undoubtedly  the  Critical  doctrine, 
and  I  can  see  no  reason  to  interpret  this  passage  as  failing  to  indicate 
that  pure  thought  of  objects  depends  upon  pure  intuition.  But  even 
if  we  insist  that  it  does  not  assert  such  dependence,  there  would  not 
be  the  slightest  ground  for  maintaining  that  when  Kant  wrote  this 


XI  §2]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  223 

The  second  point  in  which  Transcendental  Logic  differs 
from  Formal  Logic  is  this.  Transcendental  Logic  is  concerned 
only  with  what  is  known  a  priori,  or  in  other  words  with  the 
universal  and  necessary.  What  is  universal  and  necessary  can, 
on  Critical  principles,  be  known  only  if  it  is  due,  not  to  the 
nature  of  the  object,  but  to  the  nature  of  the  mind.  Hence 
Transcendental  Logic  has  to  enquire  into  the  origin  of  the 
a  priori  cognitions  which  it  studies.  Such  a  question  is  never 
raised  by  Formal  Logic,  which  accepts  knowledge  as  given 
and,  without  enquiring  into  its  source,  considers  its  form 
alone,  and  determines  the  formal  laws  which  govern  its  use 
in  reasoning.1 

Transcendental  Logic  therefore  differs  from  Formal  Logic, 
firstly,  because  it  deals  with  a  particular  kind  of  thought 
(synthetic  a  priori  thinking),2  while  Formal  Logic  deals  with 
all  thought;  and  secondly,  because  it  seeks  to  determine  the 
origin  of  the  kind  of  thought  it  studies,  a  question  which 
Formal  Logic  ignores. 

§  2.  The  Nature  of  Transcendental  Logic 

The  question  with  which  Transcendental  Logic  is  concerned 
is  whether  our  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge  has  elements 
contributed  to  it  by  the  nature  of  the  human  understanding, 
in  addition  to  those  elements  contributed  by  human  sensibility. 
The  elements  contributed  by  sensibility  were  pure  intuitions 
which  contained  the  form  of  intuition.  The  elements  con- 
tributed by  understanding  would  by  analogy  be  pure  thoughts, 

sentence  he  was  unaware  of  this  dependence.  And  indeed  the  state- 
ment that  Transcendental  Logic  would  not  abstract  from  all  the 
content  of  knowledge,  but  only  from  the  empirical  content,  seems 
itself  to  imply  such  dependence. 

1 A  56  -  B  80. 

2  This  statement  remains  true,  although  we  shall  find  that  synthetic 
a  priori  thinking  is  present  in  all  our  empirical  judgements,  just  as 
pure  intuition  is  present  in  all  empirical  intuitions.  This  is  indicated 
in  the  account  of  Transcendental  Logic  given  in  A  55  =  B  79  ff., 
and  in  the  account  of  its  divisions  given  in  A  62  =  B  87  ff.  The 
common  complaint  that  Kant  does  not  make  this  clear  at  the  start 
seems  to  me  groundless. 


224       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  2 

or  pure  concepts,  containing  the  form  of  thought.1  We  have 
already  learnt  that  pure  concepts  are  given,  as  regards  their 
matter  or  content,  in  the  nature  of  understanding  itself;2  and 
this  can  only  mean  that  the  content  of  pure  concepts  is  the 
form  of  the  acts  of  thinking.  Such  pure  concepts  would  have 
their  origin  in  the  nature  of  thought  itself,  and  would  not 
be  derived  by  abstraction  from  either  empirical  or  pure  in- 
tuition, although,  like  all  other  concepts,  they  would  be  empty 
apart  from  intuition.3 

We  are  now  told  that  pure  concepts  would  be  acts  of  pure 
thought.4  This  is  a  difficult  statement,  and  we  are  offered  little 
help  as  to  its  precise  meaning.  We  can  hardly  take  'concept* 
to  mean  'conceiving';  if  we  could,  every  concept  would  be 
an  act  of  thought,  and  every  pure  concept  would  be  an  act 
of  pure  thought.  Kant  is  presumably  asserting  that  the  content 
of  the  pure  concept  must  be  acts  of  pure  thought;  or  more 
exactly  that  the  content  of  the  pure  concept  must  be  what  is 
common  to  acts  of  pure  thought.6  I  doubt  if  this  means  more 
than  that  a  pure  concept  is  a  concept  of  what  is  common  to 
acts  of  thinking  or  judging,  so  far  as  these  acts  are  formal  and 
therefore  pure^'it  is,  in  short,  another  way  of  saying  that  pure 
concepts  are  concepts  of  the  forms  of  thinking.6  We  must, 
however,  remember  also  that  although  we  can  isolate  pure 
concepts  in  philosophy  and  conceive  them  'in  their  purity',7 
they  are  manifested  throughout  our  ordinary  experience  in  the 
very  form  of  the  judgements  which  we  are  continually  making 

1  A  51  =  B  75,  'The  form  of  thought  of  an  object  in  general.' 

2  See  Chapter  IX§4  and  compare  Log.  §§  3  and  5  (IX  92  and  93). 

3  Their  content  would  be  empty  forms  of  judgement.  Compare 
A  239  =  B  298. 

4  A  57  =  B  81,  'Handlungen  desreinen  Denkens.'  Compare  also  A  96, 
where  the  categories  are  said  to  contain  the  pure  thought  involved  in 
every  experience. 

6  It  must  not  be  forgotten  that  Kant  describes,  for  example,  the 
concept  of  spatiality  as  the  concept  of  spaces  in  general ;  and  that  the 
concept  of  activity  might  be  described  as  the  concept  of  acts  in  general. 

6  As  Kant  himself  adds,  they  are  therefore  not  of  empirical  or 
aesthetic  origin.  Perhaps  the  word  *  aesthetic*  is  added  to  cover  space 
and  time  as  well  as  empirical  intuitions.  7  A  66  =  B  91. 


XI  §  2]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  225 

about  empirical  objects.1  As  such  they  may  be  said  to  be  acts 
of  pure  thought,2  the  formal  acts  which  are  present  in  every 
judgement  and  are  the  same  whatever  be  the  particular  objects 
thought.  This  statement  remains  true,  whether  the  pure 
concepts  in  question  have  been  explicitly  conceived  in  philo- 
sophical reflexion  or  not. 

It  should  also  be  noted  that  such  pure  concepts  'merely 
as  acts  of  thought,  would  be  related  a  priori  to  objects'?  The 
reference  to  objects  must  not  be  overlooked.  A  pure  concept 
is  not  merely  a  concept  of  the  form  of  thought ;  it  is  a  concept 
of  the  form  of  thought  as  related  to  and  determining  an  object* 
The  meaning  of  this  will  be  explained  later.5 

We  have  still  to  prove  that  there  are  such  concepts,  but 
in  anticipation  of  such  a  proof  we  say,  provisionally,  that  the 
science  which  studies  such  concepts — or,  to  use  a  wider  term, 
such  cognitions — is  Transcendental  Logic. 

Transcendental  Logic  studies  'the  origin,  the  extent,  and 
the  objective  validity  of  such  cognitions'.6  It  will  show  that 
there  are  a  priori  concepts  distinct  from  space  and  time.  It  will 
show  also  (i)  that  they  are  due  to  the  nature  of^thought ;  (2)  that 
they  apply  only  to  what  is  given  to  sense;  and (3)  that  they  are 
necessarily  valid  of  all  objects  given  to  sense.  The  first  point 
is  concerned  with  origin,  the  second  with  extent,  and  the  third 
with  objective  validity. 

These  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding  are  called  'cate- 
gories'. They  are  a  priori  in  the  sense  of  being  necessary  and 
universal.  If  concepts  are  properly  called  categories,  they  must 
apply  to  all  objects  without  exception;7  and  to  speak  as  if 

1  For  example,  when  we  say  'This  house  is  large*,  we  are  applying 
the  category  of  substance  and  accident. 

2  It  would  be  more  exact  to  say  that  they  are  manifested  in,  or 
constitute  the  common  character  of,  such  acts  of  pure  thought. 

3  Similarly  in  A  5 1  —  B  75  Kant  says  that  the  pure  concept  contains 
the  form  of  thought  of  an  object  in  general.  4  See  B  128-9. 

6  Compare  Chapter  XII  §  6.  •  A  57  =  B  81. 

7  This  is  why  they  are  said  to  contain  the  form  of  thinking  of  an 
object  in  general.  Indeed  we  shall  find  that  they  may  be  called  concepts 
of  an  object  in  general. 

VOL.  I  H 


226       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  3 

categories  could  apply  to  some  objects,  and  not  to  others, 
is  a  contradiction  in  terms. 

It  may  be  objected  that  each  category  applies  only  to  a 
particular  kind  of  object,  for  example,  that  the  category  of 
cause  and  effect  applies  only  to  events.  But  an  event  is  not 
an  object  in  the  strict  sense ;  it  is  only  a  change  in  the  accidents 
of  a  substance,  and  not  itself  a  concrete  thing.  For  Kant  an 
object  is  a  concrete  thing,  and  every  concrete  real  thing,  so  far 
as  it  can  be  experienced,  must  fall  under  all  the  categories: 
it  must  be  a  substance  possessed  of  quantity  and  quality  and 
interacting  with  other  substances  in  accordance  with  the  laws 
of  cause  and  effect.  We  can  no  doubt  consider  different  de- 
terminations and  relations  of  an  object  in  abstraction,  but  they 
are  nevertheless  only  determinations  and  relations  of  an  object, 
and  not,  properly  speaking,  objects  themselves.1 

If  Transcendental  Logic  is  to  prove  that  a  number  of  cate- 
gories necessarily  apply  to  all  objects  given  to  sense,  it  will 
have  to  establish  a  series  of  necessary  and  universal  synthetic 
propositions.  These  propositions  are  called  'Principles';  and 
to  speak  of  Transcendental  Logic  as  a  science  of  pure  concepts 
does  not  mean  that  it  considers  concepts  only  and  ignores 
principles. 

§  3.  Transcendental  Knowledge 

The  use  of  such  phrases  as  ' Transcendental  Aesthetic'  and 
'Transcendental  Logic'  calls  for  some  explanation  of  the 
meaning  of  the  word  'transcendental';  and  Kant  at  this  stage2 

1  The  view  that  I  have  taken  is  sometimes  questioned,  but  it  seems 
to  me  the  only  one  that  will  make  sense  of  Kant's  doctrine.  I  have 
not  found  any  absolutely  unambiguous  statement  of  it  in  the  Kritik 
itself,  but  such  a  statement  can  be  found  in  Nachlass  5932  (XVIII  391). 
If  it  be  objected  that  this  destroys  the  connexion  between  the  cate- 
gories and  the  forms  of  judgement,  since  the  latter  are  alternatives, 
I  can  only  reply  that  this  is  not  true  of  the  main  divisions  of  the 
forms  of  judgement,  and  that  I  believe  the  theory  at  the  back  of  Kant's 
mind  is  that  all  the  forms  of  thought  must  be  present  in  every  judge- 
ment (and  even  in  every  conception);  compare  the  identification  of 
the  form  of  the  concept  and  the  form  of  thought  in  A  239  =  B  298. 

2  A  56  ==  B  80-1. 


XI  §  3]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  227 

attempts  to  state  what  he  means  by  calling  knowledge  'transcen- 
dental'. His  statement  is  unduly  complicated,1  and  I  will 
attempt  to  explain  his  doctrine  more  clearly. 

While  all  transcendental  knowledge  is  necessarily  pure, 
it  is  not  to  be  supposed  that  all  pure  knowledge  is  transcen- 
dental. Transcendental  knowledge  is  knowledge  of  a  critical 
or  reflective  or  philosophical  type ;  that  is  to  say,  it  is  knowledge 
that  knowledge  is  pure  or  a  priori.  Thus  the  Transcendental 
Aesthetic  is  transcendental,  since  it  shows  that  our  intuitions 
of  space  and  time  are  pure;  and  Transcendental  Logic  is 
transcendental,  since  it  shows  that  the  human  mind  possesses 
certain  pure  concepts  or  categories.  Mathematical  knowledge, 
on  the  other  hand,  is  pure  or  a  priori,  but  not  transcendental: 
only  the  knowledge  that  mathematics  is  an  a  priori  science  can 
be  called  transcendental. 

So  far,  to  speak  of  knowledge  as  transcendental  indicates 
only  that  such  knowledge  is  a  philosophical  theory  of  the 
a  priori;  but  I  think  we  must  also  say  it  indicates  that  such 
knowledge  is  Kant's  own  philosophical  theory  of  the  a  priori. 
On  Kant's  view  a  priori  knowledge  is  possible  only  if  it  has  its 
origin  in  the  nature  of  the  mind ;  and  a  transcendental  theory2 
is  a  theory  which  attributes  the  origin  of  a  priori  knowledge 
to  the  mind.3 

1  Thus  transcendental  knowledge  is  said  to  be  knowledge  'that 
and  how*  certain  ideas  (i)  are  applied  a  priori  or  (2)  are  possible  a  priori. 
This  looks  as  if  there  were  four  things  to  be  known  transcendentally. 
A  parenthesis  suggests  that  these  can  be  reduced  to  two:  (i)  the 
possibility,  or  (2)  the  applicability,  of  a  priori  knowledge.  As  possibility 
means  real  (not  logical)  possibility  here,  I  am  inclined  to  think  that 
'possibility*  and  Applicability1  mean  the  same  tiling.  Later  on  trans- 
cendental knowledge  becomes  knowledge  (i)  that  certain  ideas  are 
pure,  and  (2)  (although  even  the  grammar  is  hard  to  follow)  how 
it  is  possible  to  apply  them  a  priori — the  word  *  possibility*  now 
referring  clearly  to  the  possibility  of  their  application,  (i)  and  (2) — or 
'that'  and  'how* — then  refer  to  the  Metaphysical  and  Transcendental 
Deductions  respectively. 

2 1  use  the  word  'theory*  only  to  avoid  a  continual  repetition  of 
the  word  'knowledge*.  For  Kant  this  theory  is  knowledge. 

3  Or  which  attributes  the  origin  of  an  element  in  a  priori  knowledge 
to  the  mind.  Kant  habitually  uses  'knowledge*  or  'cognition*  (Erkennt- 


228       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  3 

We  have  seen  in  the  case  of  space  and  time — and  I  believe 
it  holds  of  the  categories  as  well — that  our  a  priori  knowledge 
has  not  only  a  kind  of  internal  necessity,1  but  also  a  necessary 
applicability  to  objects.  This  necessary  applicability,  or  objec- 
tive validity,  must  also  be  considered  by  a  transcendental 
theory  of  the  a  priori? 

There  is  yet  another  point.  A  theory  which  attributes  the 
origin  of  a  priori  knowledge  to  the  mind  will  be  forced,  Kant 
believes,  to  conclude  that  the  objects  of  which  such  knowledge 
is  valid  cannot  be  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.  Hence 
a  transcendental  theory  is  a  reflective  theory  of  a  priori  knowledge 
which  determines  the  extent  and  limits  of  such  knowledge  as  well 
as  its  origin  and  objective  validity.3 

It  may  be  asked  which  of  these  many  characteristics  is  the 
essential  one  in  virtue  of  which  a  theory  (or  a  piece  of  know- 
ledge) is  called  *  transcendental'.  I  think  we  must  reply  that 
a  theory  is  transcendental  primarily  because  of  its  concern 
with  the  origin  of  our  cognitions.  It  is  because  of  our  insight 
into  'origin*  that  we  are  able  to  determine  'extent'  and  'limits', 
and  even  to  determine  'objective  validity*.  A  transcendental 
theory  must  deal  with  all  these  questions,  but  the  cardinal 
question  would  appear  to  be  that  of  origin. 

nis)  to  indicate  what  is  strictly  only  an  element  in  knowledge.  This 
seems  to  me  reasonable  enough  and  to  offer  no  real  difficulty  to  the 
intelligent  reader:  if  Kant  put  the  necessary  qualifications  into  every 
sentence,  the  Kritik  would  be  unreadable.  Here,  as  always,  it  is  our 
task  to  see  the  reality  he  is  describing,  and  not  to  interpret  his  words 
in  a  merely  mechanical  way. 

1  The   categories   differ   in   certain   fundamental   ways   from   our 
intuitions  of  space  and  time,  but  nevertheless  the  unity  of  thought 
is  supposed  to  differentiate  itself  into  a  necessary  system  of  the  forms 
of  judgement  and  so  of  the  categories. 

2  In  the  Aesthetic  Kant's  argument  was  that  the  combination  of 
internal  necessity  and  objective  validity  in  a  priori  knowledge  is 
possible  only  if  the  origin  of  such  knowledge  is  to  be  found  in  the 
nature  of  the  mind.   In  the  Analytic  the  objective  validity  of  the 
categories  has  to  be  'deduced*  or  justified.   In  the  Dialectic  it  is 
maintained  that  the  Ideas  of  reason  have  no  objective  validity. 

8  We  have  already  seen,  in  §§  1-2  above,  that  such  are  the  charac- 
teristics of  Transcendental  Logic. 


XI  §  3]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  229 

I  have  tried  to  state  the  position  as  simply  as  possible,  but 
we  must  not  wholly  overlook  the  many  complications  which 
it  involves.  The  a  priori  knowledge  with  which  a  transcendental 
philosophy  is  concerned  is  not  only  a  priori  knowledge  proper, 
such  as  is  to  be  found  in  mathematics  and  in  the  presuppositions 
of  physics.1  It  covers  also  what  merely  professes  to  be  a  priori 
knowledge,  namely,  the  metaphysical  doctrines  of  the  ration- 
alists. Above  all,  it  covers  what  is  only  an  element  in  a  priori 
knowledge,  namely,  our  pure  intuitions  (of  space  and  time) 
and  our  pure  concepts  (including  both  the  categories  of  the 
understanding  and  the  Ideas  of  reason).  Indeed  it  is  primarily 
our  pure  intuitions  and  our  pure  concepts  whose  origin  is 
attributed  by  a  transcendental  philosophy  to  the  nature  of  the 
mind;  and  our  whole  view  of  a  priori  knowledge  (whether 
genuine  or  illusory)  is  determined  by  such  attribution. 

Since  our  pure  intuitions  and  pure  concepts,  together  with 
the  capacities  or  powers  in  which  they  originate,  are  for  Kant 
the  necessary  conditions  of  all  a  priori  knowledge  and  indeed 
of  all  experience,  transcendental  knowledge  may  also  be 
described  as  knowledge  of  the  necessary  conditions  of  experience? 
We  may  put  this  otherwise  by  saying  that  transcendental 
knowledge  is  knowledge  of  what  is  logically  prior  to  experience 
or  of  'what  goes  before  all  experience  (a  priori)'.  It  is  to  be 
distinguished  from  'transcendent*  knowledge  which  is  (or 
claims  to  be)  knowledge  of  'what  goes  beyond  all  experience ' 
to  the  super-sensible  or  to  the  thing-in-itself.3 

1  Such  as  (in  the  eighteenth  century)  that  every  event  must  have 
a  cause. 

2  This  statement  would  require  some  qualification  to  cover  the 
special  case  of  Ideas  of  reason. 

3  See  Pro/.  Anhang  (IV  373  n.).  'The  word  "transcendental' *  means 
.  .  .  not  something  which  goes  beyond  all  experience,  but  something 
which  goes  before  all  experience  (a  priori).'  It  would  be  better  to 
say  that  the  word  'transcendental*  as  applied  to  knowledge  indicates 
knowledge,  not  of  something  which  goes  beyond  all  experience,  but 
of  something  which  goes  before  all  experience  a  priori.  Kant,  however, 
applies  the  word  *  transcendental',  not  only  to  knowledge  of  the  neces- 
sary conditions  of  experience,  but  also  to  these  necessary  conditions 
themselves. 


33o       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  4 

The  question  naturally  arises  why  Kant  should  use  the  word 
'transcendental*  to  describe  knowledge  of  this  kind.  Any 
answer  to  this  question  would  be  a  matter  of  conjecture.  In 
the  time  of  Kant  the  word  seems  to  have  been  used  very 
vaguely,  and  was  more  or  less  equivalent  to  'metaphysical.'1 
He  adapted  it  to  his  own  purposes,  and  gave  to  it  the  meaning 
which  I  have  explained.  If  we  find  it  helpful  to  think  of  tran- 
scendental knowledge  as  knowledge  of  that  which  transcends 
experience  as  its  necessary  condition,  I  do  not  see  why  we  should 
refrain  from  doing  so. 

It  should  not,  I  think,  either  surprise  or  confuse  us  that 
Kant  also  applies  the  word  'transcendental'  to  the  necessary 
conditions  of  experience  themselves,  so  far  as  these  have  their 
origin  in  the  nature  of  the  mind.2  There  is  much  greater  danger 
of  confusion  if  the  word  is  used  also  to  mean  'transcendent1.3 
We  have  already  seen  one  example4  in  which  this  is  alleged 
to  be  the  case — the  transcendental  ideality  of  space  and  time. 
We  have  now  to  consider  another  example,  which  is  more 
troublesome. 

§  4.  The  Transcendental  Use  of  Knowledge 

Transcendental  knowledge,  so  far  as  it  is  knowledge  of  the 
necessary  applicability  of  an  a  priori  idea,  is  knowledge  of  the 
use  of  such  an  idea.  Kant  therefore  thinks  it  necessary  to  point 

1  The  word  seems  to  be  derived  from  the  schoolmen,  who  spoke 
of  certain  concepts — ens,  res,  aliquid>  unum,  verum,  bonum — both  as 
transcendentia  and  as  transcendentalia,  on  the  ground  that  they  trans- 
cended the  categories.  This  doctrine  has  its  root  in  Aristotle ;  see  Ross, 
Aristotle,  p.  156. 

2  For  example,  in  phrases  like  'the  transcendental  unity  of  appercep- 
tion' and  'the  transcendental  synthesis  of  the  imagination'.  These 
also,  although  they  are   immanent   in  experience,  may  be   said  to 
transcend  experience,  not  in  the  sense  of  going  beyond  experience 
to  the  super-sensible,  but  in  the  sense  of  being  conditions  logically 
prior  to  experience.  Compare  B  151. 

8  'Transcendent  knowledge*  should  be  knowledge  of  what  goes 
beyond  experience,  and  anything  which  is  'transcendent*  should  be 
something  which  goes  beyond  experience.

conclusive. 


XI  §4]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  231 

out  that  the  use  of  the  idea  may  itself  be  transcendental.1  The 
sense  in  which  'transcendental'  is  applied  to  the  use  of  an  idea2 
is  different  from  the  sense  in  which  it  is  applied  to  knowledge 
itself;  and  this  may  easily  be  a  source  of  confusion. 

The  use  of  an  a  priori  idea  is  transcendental,  if  the  idea 
is  applied  to  things  in  general  or  things-in-themselves  :3  its  use 
is  empirical,  if  the  idea  is  applied  to  sensible  objects  or  objects 
of  a  possible  experience.  The  transcendental  use  is  always 
illegitimate;  it  is  a  misuse  or  abuse.4  Thus  the  category  of 
cause  has,  according  to  Kant,  an  empirical  use  only:  we  can 
say  that  it  must  govern  all  objects  given  to  sense  in  space  and 
time.  If  it  is  applied  to  things-in-themselves,  this  is  a  transcen- 
dental and  illegitimate  use  of  the  category.5  Similarly,  if  space 
is  treated  as  a  form  of  sensibility  applying  only  to  objects 
of  outer  sense,  its  use  is  empirical,  although  it  itself  is  a  pure 
intuition.  Its  use  would  be  transcendental  and  improper, 
if  the  reference  to  sense  were  removed,  and  if  space  were 
treated  as  applying  to  things-in-themselves. 

The  character  of  an  idea  and  its  use  are  therefore  quite 

1  A  56  =  B  81.  Compare  A  139  =  B  178  and  A  238  =  B  297-8, 
.  ad  see  also  Chapter  LIV.  He  does  this  without  the  slightest  warning 
that  'transcendental*  is  here  used  in  a  different  sense. 

2  Or  to  the  use  of  a  power  of  the  mind.  See  e.g.  A  180  —  B  223  and 
A  257   =   B  313  for  the  transcendental  use  of  understanding,  and 
A  131   —  B  170  for  the  transcendental  use  of  reason. 

3  A  238   =   B  298.  In  Kant's  copy  of  the  Kritik  (see  Nachtrage 
CXVII)  'things  in  general  and  in  themselves'  is  corrected  to  'objects 
which  are  given  in  no  intuition,  and  therefore  are  not  sensible  objects'. 
In  A  56  —  B  8 1  the  idea  is  said  to  be  applied  to  'objects  in  general', 
but  in  this  connexion  'objects  in  general'  is  equal  to  'things  in  general', 
and  covers  things-in-themselves. 

4  A  296  =  B  352.  Note,  however,  that  in  A  94  Kant  seems  to  speak 
of  a  legitimate  use  of  the  powers  of  the  mind,  which  he  nevertheless 
describes  as  transcendental.  The  statement  in  A  131  =  B  170  (that 
the  transcendental  use  of  reason  is  never  objectively  valid)  seems 
also  to  imply  that  there  is  a  transcendental  use  of  understanding 
which  is  objectively  valid.  'Transcendental  use'  would  here  seem  to 
be  use  in  determining  the  conditions  of  experience,  and  so  in  deter- 
mining the  objects  of  experience. 

6  Compare  A  180  =  B  223 ;  also  A  146  =  B  185,  A  238-9  =  B  298, 
A  242,  B  406,  A  711  =  B  739. 


232        FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  5 

different  things.  Although  an  idea  is  itself  pure  or  a  priori, 
its  use  may  be,  and  indeed  ought  to  be,  empirical.  Such  use, 
although  empirical  (in  the  sense  of  concerning  only  objects 
of  possible  experience),  is  still  necessary  and  universal,  for  the 
idea  necessarily  applies  to  all  objects  given  to  sense. 

This  meaning  of  'transcendental*  seems  to  have  little  or 
nothing  to  do  with  the  meaning  of  'transcendental'  when 
applied  to  knowledge.  Kant's  exposition  would  have  been 
simpler,  if  he  had  spoken  of  the  'transcendent'  and  'immanent* 
use1  of  ideas  in  place  of  the  'transcendental'  and  'empirical'  use  .2 

§  5.  Can  Transcendental  Logic  supersede  Formal  Logic? 

It  is  often  said  that  Transcendental  Logic  must  supersede 
Formal  Logic,3  although  Kant  failed  to  grasp  this  necessary 
consequence  of  his  own  doctrine. 

To  such  a  view  there  are  obvious  objections.  Even  if 
Transcendental  Logic  were  generally  accepted  as  true — and 
this  is  far  from  being  the  case — it  would  still  remain  a  logic 
which  studied  only  a  special  kind  of  thinking,  namely,  synthetic 
a  priori  thinking.  There  must  always  be  a  logic  which  studie^ 
thinking  in  general;  and  although  we  may  hold  that  such  ~ 
logic  cannot  be  purely  formal  in  Kant's  sense,  and  that  it  rr^t 

1  Compare  A  308  =  B  365. 

2  Kant  may  be  unconscious  that  he  is  employing  'transcendental'  in 
two  senses.  When  he  speaks  of  'transcendental  use',   he  perhaps 
employs  the  phrase  vaguely  (for  example,  as  meaning  a  use  independent 
of  experience),  and  he  may  have  no  sharply  defined  idea  that  such 
a  use  'goes  beyond  experience*.  I  have  found,  however,  one  place 
where  Kant  says  explicitly  that  a  transcendental  use  is  one  going 
beyond  the  limits  of  experience  (A  296  =   B  352-3).  This  seems 
definitely  to  show  that  here  'transcendental*  is  equivalent  to  'trans- 
cendent' ;  but  even  in  this  passage  Kant  avoids  such  identification  by 
defining  'transcendent'  in  an  unusual  way.  A  principle  is  said  to  be 
'transcendent',  not  if  it  merely  goes  beyond  the  limits  of  experience, 
but  if  it  takes  away  these  limits,  or  commands  us  to  transgress  them. 
For  'transcendent',  see  also  A  781  =  B  809. 

8  See,  for  example,  Kinkel,  in  his  introduction  to  Kant's  Logik 
(Phil.  Bib.  43,  p.  xvi).  This  seems  to  rest  partly  on  the  view  that 
Formal  Logic  studies  only  analytic  judgements  and  partly  on  the 
view  that  analytic  judgements  have  no  object.  Both  of  these  views 
are,  I  believe,  false. 


XI  §  6]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  233 

take  into  account  the  matter  of  thought,  Transcendental 
Logic  could,  at  the  best,  be  only  a  part  of  such  a  general  logic 
and  not  the  whole.  Furthermore  Transcendental  Logic  is 
mainly  concerned  with  metaphysical  questions,  and  in  spite 
of  views  to  the  contrary  I  cannot  see  any  advantage  to  be 
gained  by  ignoring  the  distinction  between  logical  and  meta- 
physical enquiries.  It  is  no  part  of  the  task  of  logic  to  prove 
that  every  event  must  have  a  cause,  and  there  is  much  in  Kant's 
Transcendental  Logic  which  can  have  no  place  whatever  in 
general  logic. 

The  most  we  can  say  is  that  Kant's  doctrines  call  for  a 
reconsideration  of  the  nature  of  Formal  Logic,  and  suggest 
the  possibility  of  a  more  philosophic  and  less  formal,  but  still 
general,  logic,  in  which  some  Critical  theories  might  find  a  place. 
He  professes  to  show,  for  example,  that  there  is  an  element 
of  synthesis  present  in  all  judgements,  and  that  this  element 
of  synthesis  is  necessary  for  all  knowledge  of  objects.  If  these 
theories  were  accepted,  wre  might  say  that  any  logic  which 
ignored  them  was  condemned  to  superficiality ;  but  to  say  this 
is  very  far  from  saying  either  that  the  Kritik  of  Pure  Reason 
can  be  a  substitute  for  general  logic  or  that  it  can  be  wholly 
absorbed  into  a  general  logic.  It  is  also  very  far  from  saying 
that  the  doctrines  of  Formal  Logic  ought  to  be  abandoned. 

§  6.  Divisions  of  Transcendental  Logic 

Transcendental  Logic  isolates  understanding,  as  Transcen- 
dental Aesthetic  isolated  sensibility.1  This  isolation  or  abstrac- 
tion is,  however,  less  likely  to  mislead  us,  because  of  what 
has  gone  before.  We  have  to  bear  in  mind — though  this  will 
become  clearer  as  we  advance — that  the  use  of  such  a  priori 
cognitions  as  are  derived  from  thought  is  possible  only  on  the 
condition  that  objects  are  given  to  us  in  intuition.2 

1  A  62  -  B  87;  A  22  =  B  36. 

2  This  is  not  obvious  at  first  sight,  and  Kant  always  recognises 
that  there  is  a  claim  in  pure  thought  to  go  beyond  objects  of  sense. 
He  rejects  this  claim  on  the  ground  that  such  thinking  is,  for  human 
beings,  empty  and  meaningless. 

VOL.  I  H* 


234       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  6 

Transcendental  Logic,  like  Formal  Logic,  is  divided  into 
a  Doctrine  of  Elements  and  a  Doctrine  of  Method. 

The  Transcendental  Doctrine  of  Method  determines  the 
formal  conditions  of  a  complete  system  of  pure  reason.1 

The  Transcendental  Doctrine  of  Elements  is  divided  into 
a  Transcendental  Analytic  and  a  Transcendental  Dialectic,  in 
this  respect  also  following  the  divisions  of  Formal  Logic. 

The  Transcendental  Analytic  analyses  out  of  our  whole 
a  priori  knowledge  the  elements  which  belong  to  pure  under- 
standing— the  elements  belonging  to  pure  intuition  being 
already  determined.2  In  this  respect  it  is  parallel  to  the  Analytic 
of  Formal  Logic,  which  analysed  the  whole  business  of  thought 
(so  far  as  that  is  formal)  into  its  elements.3 

The  Transcendental  Analytic  will  establish  the  categories 
and  principles  without  which  no  object  can  be  thought.  It 
determines  positively  the  conditions  under  which  any  and 
every  object  of  knowledge  must  necessarily  be  thought^  if  it 
is  to  be  an  object ;  just  as  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic  estab- 
lished the  conditions  (the  forms  of  sensibility)  under  which 
any  and  every  object  must  be  given,  if  it  is  to  be  an  object. 

If  this  claim  is  justified,  any  professed  cognition  inconsistent 
with  the  Principles  of  the  Transcendental  Analytic  would  have 
no  reference  to  any  object,  and  would  therefore  have  no  truth — 
for  truth  is  always  the  correspondence  of  thought  with  its 
object.  Hence  the  Transcendental  Analytic  is  a  logic  of  truth. 

We  are,  however,  tempted  to  extend  the  use  of  these  Prin- 
ciples beyond  the  limits  of  sensuous  experience.  We  forget 
that  formal  principles  derived  from  the  understanding,  though 
they  must  apply  to  any  object  which  we  can  think,  require 
this  object  to  be  given  to  sense :  they  cannot  produce  an  object 
out  of  themselves.  Because  we  forget  this,  we  apply,  for  example, 

1  A  707-8  =  B  735-6.  The  Kritik  itself  is  not  to  be  regarded  as 
such  a  system;  A  14  =  B  28,  A  81-2  =  B  107. 

2  A  64  =  B  89.  Kant  himself  says  that  the  Transcendental  Analytic 
analyses  our  whole  a  priori  knowledge  into  the  elements  which  belong 
to  pure  understanding;  but  this  seems  a  less  exact  statement,  although 
it  gives  a  better  parallel.  3  A  60  =  B  84. 


XI  §  7]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  235 

the  pure  concept  of  substance  to  supposed  objects  which  are 
not,  and  perhaps  cannot  be,  given  to  our  senses.1 

In  doing  so,  we  cease  to  use  our  a  priori  principles  as  a  canon, 
or  conditio  sine  qua  non,  by  which  to  criticise  our  empirical 
judgements  about  experienced  objects.  We  use  them  instead 
as  an  organon  or  tool  for  extending  our  knowledge  to  objects 
given  in  no  experience.  This  misuse  of  pure  understanding 
is  dialectical,  and  is  a  source  of  illusion. 

The  Transcendental  Dialectic  is  a  criticism  of  this  dialectical 
illusion,  of  this  misuse  of  pure  understanding  or  pure  reason 
beyond  the  limits  of  what  is  given  to  sensuous  experience. 
As  such  it  is  a  criticism  of  rationalist  metaphysics. 

The  dialectical  error  in  Formal  Logic,  it  should  be  noted, 
is  to  use  the  formal  principles  of  logic  as  if  they  gave  us  in- 
formation about  any  kind  of  object.2  The  dialectical  error 
in  Transcendental  Logic  is  to  use  the  Principles  of  Transcen- 
dental Logic  as  if  they  gave  us  information  about  non-sensible 
objects. 

§  7.  Kant's  'Architectonic' 

It  is  a  common  criticism  of  Kant  that  he  attempts  to  force 
the  contents  of  the  Kritik  into  an  artificial  and  external  frame- 
work borrowed  from  Formal  Logic.  This  general  plan  or 
framework  is  described  as  Kant's  'architectonic',  and  his  love 
of  architectonic  is  alleged  to  distort  his  thinking. 

I  believe  this  contention  to  be  grossly  exaggerated,  at  any 
rate  as  regards  the  Analytic,  but  here  I  wish  only  to  call  attention 
to  the  fact  that  Kant  is  very  far  from  making  the  divisions 
of  Transcendental  Logic  follow  those  of  Formal  Logic  in  any 

1  Compare  A  96.  Kant  says,  in  A  63  —  B  87-8,  that  to  do  this 
is  to  make  a  material  use  of  merely  formal  principles  of  pure  under- 
standing. Here  again  he  seems  to  identify  the  matter  or  content  of 
thought  with   its   objects  (see   Chapter   IX  §  4).   Yet  it  must  be 
remembered  that  although  pure  concepts  have  as  their  content  or 
matter  the  form  of  thought,  they  require  a  further  matter  derived 
from  intuition  if  they  are  to  have  objective  validity. 

2  This   is   what   Kant   believed   Leibniz  to   have   done.    See   the 
Amphiboly  of  the  Concepts  of  Reflexion,  A  260  =  B  316  ff. 


236       FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  7 

slavish  manner.  On  the  contrary,  there  are  marked  divergences 
between  the  divisions  of  the  two  logics,  and  these  are  due 
to  the  differences  in  the  nature  of  the  problems  dealt  with 
in  these  sciences. 

In  the  Transcendental  Analytic  there  are  two  divisions: 
(i)  The  Analytic  of  Concepts  and  (2)  the  Analytic  of  Principles 
(called  also  the  Transcendental  Doctrine  of  Judgement).  The 
first  of  these  deals  with  the  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding, 
the  second  with  the  Principles  based  upon  these  concepts. 
We  have  already  seen,  and  we  shall  see  more  clearly  in  the 
sequel,  that  these  two  divisions  are  forced  upon  Kant  by  the 
nature  of  his  subject-matter.  They  are  indeed  parallel  to  the 
two  divisions  in  the  Analytic  of  Formal  Logic  which  deal 
with  concepts  and  judgements,  but  they  perform  very  different 
functions  ;*  nor  is  there  anything  artificial  or  surprising  in  the 
fact  that  both  Formal  and  Transcendental  Logic  should  deal 
separately  with  concepts  and  with  judgements. 

The  divergences  in  the  division  of  the  two  logics  are  of 
greater  importance  than  the  similarities. 

The  Analytic  of  Principles  has,  as  its  First  Part,  a  chapter 
on  the  Schematism  of  the  Categories.  There  is  nothing  cor- 
responding to  this  in  Formal  Logic,  as  Kant  himself  points 
out.2  How  it  can  be  ascribed  to  the  artificial  influence  of  Kant's 
'logical  architectonic',  I  fail  to  understand. 

Furthermore,  the  Analytic  of  Formal  Logic  contains  three 
divisions.  It  is  an  analytic  of  concepts,  judgements,  and  infer- 
ences.3 The  third  division  is  concerned  chiefly  with  the  syllog- 
ism and  gives  us  a  canon  of  reason.  There  is  nothing  corresponding 
to  this  third  division  in  the  Transcendental  Analytic. 

1  In  Formal  Logic  the  two  divisions  are  concerned  respectively 
with  the  form  of  all  concepts  and  the  form  of  all  judgements.  In 
Transcendental  Logic  these  two  divisions  give  us  firstly,  a  list  of  the 
categories  and  a  general  justification  of  their  objective  validity;  and, 
secondly,  a  demonstration  of  the  separate  a  priori  judgements  or 
principles  based  upon  each  of  the  categories. 

2  A  135-6  =  B  174-5. 

8  A  130  =  B  169.  The  powers  concerned  are  understanding  (in 
the  narrower  sense),  judgement,  and  reason. 


XI  §  8]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  237 

The  cause  of  this  difference  is  clear  enough.  The  Analytic 
of  Formal  Logic,  since  it  is  concerned  with  the  form,  and  not 
with  the  matter,  of  thought,  can  give  an  account  of  what 
reasoning  must  be  if  it  is  to  be  formally  correct.  The  Transcen- 
dental Analytic  is  not  concerned  with  formal  validity,  but  with 
truth.  There  is  an  objectively  valid — or,  as  Kant  calls  it,  true — 
use  of  understanding  and  judgement  as  sources  of  a  priori  know- 
ledge, and  of  this  the  Transcendental  Analytic  can  supply 
a  canon;  that  is,  it  can  show  that  the  categories  which  originate 
in  the  understanding  are  pure  concepts  without  which  no 
objects  can  be  thought,  and  that  their  application  to  objects 
of  experience  must  be  valid.  There  is  no  such  objectively  valid 
use  of  reason]1  for  the  Ideas  which  have  their  origin  in  reason, 
and  by  means  of  which  reason  attempts  to  extend  our  know- 
ledge beyond  the  limits  of  possible  experience,  have  no  relation 
to  any  object  which  can  be  given  as  congruent  with  them.2 
Hence  the  transcendental  account  of  reason  is  not  to  be  found 
in  the  Transcendental  Analytic,  which  is  a  logic  of  truth,  but 
in  the  Transcendental  Dialectic,  which  is  a  logic  of  illusion.3 

The  main  divisions  of  Transcendental  Logic  are  not  distorted 
to  fit  an  artificial  framework  derived  from  Formal  Logic.4 
They  are,  on  the  contrary,  determined  by  the  nature  of  what 
professes  to  be  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge. 

§  8.  The  Transcendental  Analytic 

The  Transcendental  Analytic,  as  we  have  seen,  seeks  to 
determine  what,  if  any,  are  the  elements  in  our  a  priori  know- 
ledge which  ought  to  be  attributed  to  pure  understanding.5 

As  understanding  is,  in  the  first  instance,  a  power  of  con- 

1This  is  called  a  transcendental  use;  A  131  =  B  170.  Compare 
§  4  above.  2  Compare  A  336  =  B  393. 

3  A  131  =  B  170.  It  may  also  be  observed  that  the  division  of  the 
Transcendental  Dialectic  into  two  books,  the  first  of  which  deals 
with  the  concepts  of  pure  reason  and  the  second  with  the  dialectical 
inferences  of  pure  reason,  is  not  determined  by  the  framework  of 
Formal  Logic. 

4  Adickes  in  his  earliest  book — Kants  Systematik — carries  this  theory 
to  absurdity.  5  A  64  =  B  89. 


338     FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC      [XI  §  9 

ceiving,  we  may  assume,  to  begin  with,  that  it  will  be  a  source 
of  concepts.  If  we  are  to  find  concepts  of  the  type  required, 
they  must  be  pure  and  not  empirical;  and  they  must  be  due 
to  thought,  not  derived  from  intuition.  They  must  not  be 
derived  even  from  pure  intuition,  as  are  temporality  and 
spatiality.  Further,  we  are  concerned  only  with  primary,  not 
wit  derivative,  concepts.  Lastly,  if  we  are  to  have  a  true 
science,  the  table  of  these  concepts  must  be  complete. 

If  we  are  to  be  sure  that  the  table  is  complete,  it  must  be 
derived  from  one  Idea1  of  the  whole  of  our  a  priori  knowledge, 
so  far  as  that  is  due  to  pure  understanding.  This  Idea  of  the 
whole  must  be  a  priori  in  the  sense  of  being  the  idea  of  a  whole 
which  articulates  itself  necessarily  into  a  complete  system  of 
pure  concepts. 

The  possibility  of  having  such  an  Idea  of  the  whole  system 
of  pure  concepts  depends  upon  the  fact  that  the  understanding, 
considered  apart  from  everything  empirical  and  sensible  (even 
apart  from  pure  intuition),  is  a  self-subsistent  and  self-sufficient 
unity.2 

This  doctrine— the  doctrine  that  the  unity  of  thought 
differentiates  itself  necessarily  into  the  forms  of  judgement  and 
so  into  the  categories — will  become  clearer  to  us  as  we  advance. 

§  9.  The  Analytic  of  Concepts 

The  First  Book  of  the  Analytic  is  the  Analytic  of  Concepts. 
It  is  not  concerned  with  the  analysis  of  concepts,  such  as  is 
necessary  to  give  them  *  distinctness'.  On  the  contrary,  it  is 
an  analysis  of  the  power  of  understanding  itself  in  order  that 
we  may  find  whether  pure  concepts  are  necessarily  involved 
in  its  activity.3  Here  once  more  we  have  the  two  characteristics 
of  a  transcendental  theory,  that  it  (i)  recognises  the  a  priori 

1  An  'Idea'  is  used  in  a  technical  sense  for  the  concept  of  a  science 
as  an  articulated  system,  and  is  'architectonic*  in  Kant's  sense  of  the 
word.  See  A  832  =  B  860.  2  A  64  =  B  89 ;  A  67  =  B  92. 

8  A  65-6  =  B  90.  The  very  clear  statement  in  A  66  =  E  gi  that 
pure  concepts  are  'developed*  only  on  the  occasion  of  experience 
should  be  specially  noted. 


XI  §  10]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  239 

character  of  certain  ideas,  and  (2)  explains  this  as  due  to  the 
nature  of  the  knowing  mind. 

The  Analytic  of  Concepts  is  divided  into  two  main  parts, 
and  each  of  these  is,  in  the  first  edition,  divided  into  three 
sections.1 

The  first  main  part  is  entitled  'The  Clue  to  the  Discovery 
of  all  Pure  Concepts  of  the  Understanding*.  This  is  referred 
to  in  the  second  edition2  as  the  'Metaphysical  Deduction',  and 
this  title  may  be  used  for  the  sake  of  brevity.  The  second  main 
part  is  headed  'The  Deduction  of  the  Pure  Concepts  of  the 
Understanding',  and  may  be  called  the  'Transcendental 
Deduction*  proper,  though  the  whole  argument  from  beginning 
to  end  is,  it  need  hardly  be  said,  a  transcendental  argument. 

We  have,  therefore,  a  Metaphysical  and  a  Transcendental 
Deduction  of  the  categories  corresponding  roughly  to  the 
Metaphysical  and  Transcendental  Expositions  of  space  and 
time.3 

§  10.  The  Metaphysical  and  Trafiscendental  Deductions 

Before  examining  the  Deductions  in  detail,  it  is  necessary 
to  consider  what  Kant  himself  has  said  about  them  as  a  whole. 

1  It  is  important  for  beginners  to  read  the  first  edition  entirely 
by  itself,  and  above  all  to  grasp  clearly  the  differences  between  the 
various  parts  and  sections  which  form  the  skeleton  of  Kant's  thought.

3  I  do  not  think  that  much  importance  should  be  attached  to  the 
description  of  the  First  Book  of  the  Analytic  of  Concepts  as  a  Meta- 
physical Deduction.  This  is  an  afterthought  probably  suggested  by 
the  distinction  between  Metaphysical  and  Transcendental  Expositions 
in  the  Aesthetic,  a  distinction  which  is  itself  an  afterthought.  The 
more  modest  description  of  this  book  as  'The  Clue1  is  in  some  ways 
preferable. 

For  an  explanation  of  the  meaning  of  the  word  *  Metaphysical* 
in  this  connexion,  see  Chapter  V  §  2.  As  I  have  suggested  there,  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction  may  be  said  to  consider  the  categories  in 
themselves,  and  the  Transcendental  Deduction  to  consider  them  in 
relation  to  other  knowledge.  The  Metaphysical  Deduction  might  also 
be  said  to  determine  the  number  and  nature  of  the  categories  by  an 
analysis  of  judgement  taken  by  itself,  and  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
to  show  that  judgement,  by  means  of  the  categories,  is  also  a  source 
of  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects. 


240      FORMAL  AND  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC    [XI  §  10 

In  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  the  a  priori  origin  of  the 
categories  is  established  by  their  perfect  agreement  with  the 
universal  logical  functions  (that  is,  forms)  of  thought.  In  the 
Transcendental  Deduction  what  is  shown  is  their  possibility 
as  a  priori  cognitions  of  objects  of  intuition.1  More  precisely, 
the  Metaphysical  Deduction  is  concerned  with  determining 
the  list  of  the  categories,  and  explaining  their  origin  in  the 
nature  of  the  understanding.  The  Transcendental  Deduction, 
which  is  a  justification  rather  than  a  deduction,  shows  how 
it  is  possible,  and  indeed  necessary,  for  categories  of  such  an 
origin  to  apply  to  objects  given  in  intuition.  It  is,  in  short, 
concerned  with  their  objective  validity,  and  so  with  their 
extent  and  with  the  limits  of  their  legitimate  use. 

In  the  preface  to  the  first  edition2  Kant  calls  special  attention 
to  the  Transcendental  Deduction  as  of  the  utmost  importance 
for  the  theory  of  knowledge,  and  asserts  that  it  has  cost  him 
more  pains  than  any  other  portion  of  his  work — a  statement 
not  easily  reconciled  with  Vaihinger's  theory  as  to  its  com- 
position. 

The  Transcendental  Deduction,  he  adds,  has  two  sides, 
a  subjective  side  and  an  objective  side.  He  even  speaks  as  if 
there  were  two  deductions,  a  Subjective  Deduction  and  an 
Objective  Deduction.3  The  Subjective  Deduction  is  of  great 
importance,  but  it  is  the  Objective  Deduction  which  is  essential. 
Kant  expresses  his  own  complete  confidence  in  the  Subjective 
Deduction,  but  recognises  that  the  reader  may  be  inclined 
to  regard  it  as  a  mere  hypothesis  or  opinion.  Even  so,  he 
insists,  the  Objective  Deduction  is  adequate  and  conclusive  by 
itself. 

In  view  of  such  an  emphatic  statement,  it  is  our  duty  to 
concentrate  on  the  objective  side  of  the  Deduction.  To  treat 

1  B  159.  In  this  passage  Kant  speaks  of  the  Transcendental  Deduc- 
tion as  concerned  with  objects  of  intuition  in  general ,  and  deals  later 
with  objects  of  human  intuition,  but  this  point  does  not  concern 
us  here.  The  possibility  in  question  is  what  Kant  calls  'real'  as  opposed 
to  'logical*  possibility;  see  BXXVI  n.  and  compare  Chapter  XLIX§4.

XI§n]  TRANSCENDENTAL  LOGIC  241 

the  Deduction  as  if  its  main  concern  were  with  the  subjective 
side,  is  to  give  a  distorted  view  of  Kant's  thinking. 

§11.  The  Subjective  and  Objective  Deductions 

The  primary  question  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
is  concerned  with  the  objects  of  the  pure  understanding.  It  asks 
'What  and  how  much  can  understanding  know  independently 
of  experience?'  Its  aim  is  to  prove  and  make  intelligible  the 
objective  validity  of  the  categories;  and  this,  Kant  believes, 
is  done  adequately  in  A  92-3  =  B  124-6,  taken  by  itself.1  This 
fundamental  argument  is  the  Objective  Deduction,  which 
however  is  by  no  means  confined  to  the  passage  mentioned. 

The  Subjective  Deduction,  on  the  other  hand,  is  concerned 
with  pure  understanding  itself,  with  its  possibility,  and  with 
the  powers  of  cognition  upon  which  it  rests.  It  is  said  to  ask 
'How  is  the  power  of  thinking  itself  possible?'2  I  should 
prefer  to  say  that  it  asks  how  the  power  of  thinking  can  be 
a  power  of  a  priori  knowledge,  and  it  professes  to  show  how 
this  is  possible  through  the  co-operation  of  imagination  and 
sense.3 

It  is  our  business  to  keep  separate  in  our  minds  the  Meta- 
physical Deduction,  and  the  subjective  and  objective  sides 
of  the  Transcendental  Deduction.  This  is  the  more  necessary 
because  Kant  himself  does  not  separate  the  Subjective  from 
the  Objective  Deduction,  at  any  rate  in  the  first  edition.  It  is 
even  doubtful  where  we  are  intended  to  draw  the  line  between 
the  two.  All  references  to  imagination  are  a  sure  sign  that 
we  are  dealing  with  the  Subjective  Deduction.  It  is  not  so 
clear  whether  the  references  to  human  sensibility  and  the 
form  of  time4  are  intended  also  to  belong  to  the  Subjective 

1  A  XVII. 

2  I  do  not  think  that  this  question  properly  indicates  Kant's  problem, 
which  is  concerned  rather  with  knowledge  of  objects  than  with  mere 
thinking. 

8  Compare  A  97. 

4  If  the  reference  to  time  is  removed  from  the  Objective  Deduction, 
the  Objective  Deduction  is  incomplete ;  for  the  pure  concepts  would

Deduction.  I  am  inclined  to  think  that  they  are  meant  to  do  so 
in  the  second  edition,  when  Kant  had  thought  out  his  position 
more  clearly. 

then  be  empty.  Kant  himself  points  out  this  incompleteness  in  B  144-5. 
As  the  Objective  Deduction  in  the  first  edition  is  supposed  to  be  com- 
plete in  itself,  presumably  the  account  of  time  must  there  be  reckoned 
as  part  of  the  Objective  Deduction :  but  it  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible, 
to  consider  the  part  of  time  without  bringing  in  imagination  and  sense ; 
and  the  argument  of  A  92—3  =  B  124-6,  which  is  said  to  be  adequate 
on  the  objective  side,  does  not  appear  to  rest  on  the  nature  of  time. 


BOOK   IV 

THE    METAPHYSICAL    DEDUCTION 
OF    THE    CATEGORIES 


CHAPTER    XII 
CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT 

§  i .  Divisions  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction 

The  Metaphysical  Deduction,  as  was  pointed  out  above, 
is  composed  of  three  sections.  Of  these  the  first  deals  with 
the  logical  use  of  the  understanding  in  general,  the  second 
with  the  forms  of  judgement,  and  only  the  third  with  the 
categories. 

This  means  that  the  third  section  alone  deals  with  the 
special  problem  of  Transcendental  Logic,  and  is  the  Meta- 
physical Deduction  proper.  The  first  two  are  preparatory,  and 
strictly  speaking  belong  to  Formal,  or  at  any  rate  to  General, 
Logic,  as  is  suggested  by  their  very  titles.  In  particular,  the 
use  of  the  understanding  in  general  can  be  discussed  only  in 
General  Logic,  and  furthermore  this  use  is  explicitly  said 
to  be  logical.1 

Nevertheless  even  in  the  second  section,  whose  contents  we 
have  already  discussed,2  we  found  considerations  introduced 
which  belonged  to  Transcendental  Logic,  and  I  think  this 
is  true,  to  some  extent,  of  the  first  section  also.3  The  very 
obscurity  of  the  first  section  is  an  indication  of  this,  for  when 
Kant  is  expounding  a  traditional  view  he  is  generally  clear. 

§  2.  The  Meaning  of  'Function' 

The  obscurity  of  the  first  section  is  due  partly  to  the  fact 
that  Kant  gives  us  no  help  as  to  the  stages  into  which  his 
argument  is  divided,  and  partly  to  his  use  of  the  word  function' 

1  The  'logical  use'  of  the  understanding  is  not  to   be  taken  as  a 
special  use  confined  to  a  special  kind  of  judgement,  but  as  the  general 
or  formal  use  present  in  all  judgements  and  studied  by  Formal  Logic. 

2  Chapter  X§  i. 

8  The  doctrine  that  sensibility  is  receptive  and  understanding 
spontaneous  (or  active)  is  metaphysical,  not  logical;  compare  Log. 
Einl.  V  (IX  36). 


246  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  2 

in  different  senses.  With  very  little  trouble  Kant  could  have 
made  this  section  much  easier. 

Thus  he  asserts  (i)  that  functions  of  unity  are  to  be  found 
in  judgements;  (2)  that  judgements  are  functions  of  unity; 
and  (3)  that  a  function  is  the  unity  of  an  act  which  (I  believe) 
is  judgement.  Any  attempt  to  interpret  these  statements 
mechanically  is  bound  to  produce  as  pretty  a  mess  as  one  could 
wish  to  see. 

In  its  primary  sense  the  'function'  of  anything  is  that  work 
which  it  alone  can  do,  or  which  it  can  do  best.1  Thus  it  is  the 
function  of  a  boat  to  sail,  and  of  a  pruning-knife  to  prune; 
for  only  a  boat  can  sail,  and  although  it  is  possible  to  prune 
with  other  things  than  a  pruning-knife,  a  pruning-knife  is 
the  instrument  which  does  this  best.  The  word  is,  however, 
applied  especially  to  the  work  appropriate  to  organs  of  a  living 
body.  It  is,  for  example,  the  function  of  the  eyes  to  see. 

In  this  sense  the  function  of  the  understanding  is  to  think 
or  to  judge. 

The  word  *  function'  is,  however,  used  also,  not  for  the  work 
which  a  thing  performs,  but  for  its  way  of  working,  or,  in  the 
language  of  the  dictionary,  for  the  'mode  of  action  by  which 
it  fulfils  its  purpose'.  The  function  is  then  a  common  nature, 
or  a  common  form,  present  in  the  separate  acts. 

However  this  may  be,  Kant,  when  he  speaks  of  understanding 
and  judgement,  uses  the  word  'function'  as  synonymous  with 
the  word  'form'.  The  functions  of  understanding  are  the  same 
— at  any  rate  in  their  denotation — as  the  forms  of  understanding ; 
and  the  functions  of  judgement,  or  the  functions  in  judgement, 
are  the  same  as  the  forms  of  judgement.2  The  general  function 

1  Compare   Plato's   account    of  Hpyov,   Republic,   3533,   and   also 
Aristotle,  Eth.  Nic.  10970. 

2  Note  especially  A  70  =  B  95,  at  the  beginning,  where  the  'form 
of  understanding*  is  equivalent  to  'the  function  of  thought  in  judge- 
ment* and  to  the  'logical  function  of  the  understanding  in  judgement*. 
This   use   of  'function*   as  equal   to   'form*  is,  I  think,  found  only 
where  we  are  concerned  with  an  activity.  Kant  never,  to  my  knowledge, 
speaks  of  a  function  of  intuition,  but  only  of  a  form  of  intuition, 
since  intuition  is  passive. 


XII  §2]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  247 

of  the  understanding,  namely  judgement,  is  supposed  to 
differentiate  itself  into  the  necessary  forms  of  judgement,  and 
these  are  identified  with  the  functions  of  the  understanding. 

It  is  important,  and  not  always  easy,  to  distinguish  which 
of  these  two  senses  of  'function'  Kant  is  using.  Unfortunately 
the  only  definition  which  he  gives  of  'function'  is  by  no  means 
clear.  'By  "function"  ',  he  says,  'I  mean  the  unity  of  the  act 
of  ordering  different  ideas  under  one  common  idea.'1  He  is 
referring  to  the  word  'function'  only  as  it  is  used  in  connexion 
with  understanding,  and  the  'act'  spoken  of  must,  I  think,  be 
the  act  of  judgement  itself.2  In  that  case  the  'unity  of  the  act' 
would  seem  to  mean  'the  form  of  the  judgement',  and  this 
is  how  it  is  understood  by  Mellin.3  The  form  of  the  judgement 
is  the  way  in  which  the  judgement  unites  ideas,  and  thus  the 
form  or  function  of  the  judgement  is  identified  with  its  special 
kind  of  unity.4 

It  is  embarrassing  when  Kant  applies  the  word  'function', 
not  to  the  forms  of  judgement,  but  to  individual  judgements 
themselves.  'All  judgements  are  functions  of  unity  in  our 
ideas.'5  I  take  the  statement  to  mean  that  judgements  are  acts 
whose  essential  task  or  function  is  to  produce  unity  in  our 
ideas.6 

1  A  68  —  B  93.  A  'common  idea'  is  a  'conceptus  communis*.  Compare 
Log.  §  5  Anmerk.  (IX  94)  and  B  133-4  n-  The  <act*  ^s  an  act  °f  analysis, 
not  of  synthesis. 

2  This  is  suggested  both  by  the  description  given  of  the  act  and 
by  the  fact  that  all  acts  of  the  understanding  can  be  reduced  to  judge- 
ment; see  A  69  =  B  94.  3  Marginalien,  p.  22. 

4  This  identification  is  possible  only  because  judgement  is  an  act. 
The  form  of  intuition,  which  is  passive,  is,  apart  from  synthesis,  a 
mere  multiplicity,  since  unity  cannot  be  given  in  intuition.  See  B  160  n. 

Even  so,  we  may  feel  some  difficulty  at  the  identification  of  the 
unity  of  the  act  with  the  way  in  which  it  produces  unity  in  ideas,  and 
consequently  with  its  form.  This  type  of  difficulty  will  recur  frequently 
as  we  advance. 

6  A  69  =  B  94.  This  is,  I  think,  loose  terminology  which  ought 
to  be  avoided.  Note  also  that  a  function  of  unity  is  apparently  a 
function  productive  of  unity,  whereas  a  function  of  understanding 
is  a  function  which  understanding  performs. 

6  Compare  Mellin,  Encyclopddisches  Wo'rterbuch,  II,  p.  687. 


248  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  3 

Kant  combines  this  statement  with  another  which  implies, 
more  correctly,  that  the  forms  of  judgement  are  'functions 
of  unity  in  judgements'.1  It  would  be  better  to  say  that  a 
judgement  is  essentially  an  act  of  uniting  our  ideas ;  and  that 
the  forms  of  judgement  are  the  different  ways  in  which  judge- 
ment unites  our  ideas,  so  far  as  these  ways  are  determined 
by  the  nature  of  thought  and  not  by  the  special  nature  of 
the  ideas  themselves. 

When  these  different  senses  of  the  word  'function*  are  dis- 
tinguished, Kant's  argument  becomes  easier  to  understand.2 

§3.  Outline  of  the  Argument 

The  main  stages  of  the  argument  seem  to  be  as  follows : 

1.  Understanding  is   a  power  of  knowing  by   means  of 

concepts.3 

2.  To  know  by  means  of  concepts  is  to  judge.4 

3.  To  judge  is  essentially  to  unite  our  ideas.5 

4.  The  different  ways  in  which  judgement  unites  our  ideas 

(independently  of  the  nature  of  the  ideas  themselves) 
are  the  forms  of  judgement  as  stated  by  Formal  Logic.8 

1  The  fact  that  'function*  and  'unity'  were  previously  identified 
is  a  further  cause  of  embarrassment.  The  form  or  function  would 
now  seem  to  be  regarded  as  the  source  of  unity  in  judgements. 

2  At  times  Kant  seems  to  use  'function*  as  equivalent  to  a  power 
or  faculty.  For  example,  he  speaks  of  imagination  as  a  'blind  function* 
of  the  soul;  A  78  =  B  103. 

8  A  68  ==  B  93 :  'The  knowledge  yielded  by  every  understanding, 
or  at  least  by  every  human  understanding,  is  by  means  of  concepts.* 
This  'knowledge*  is  rather  an  element  in  knowledge:  it  might  be 
called  'thinking*.  Compare  Log.  §  i  (IX  91):  'Knowledge  through 
concepts  is  called  thinking  (cognitio  discursiva)\ 

4  A  68  =  B  93  and  A  69  =  B  94.  'The  only  use  understanding 
can  make  of  these  concepts  is  to  judge  by  means  of  them.'  'We  can 
reduce  all  acts  of  the  understanding  to  judgements.' 

6  A  69  =  B  94.  'All  judgements  are  functions  of  unity  among  our 
ideas.' 

6  This  is  not  said  explicitly,  but  is  assumed.  Compare  Chapter 
IX  §§1-3. 


XII  §  4]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  249 

5.  Consequently  the  complete  list  of  the  forms  of  judgement 
is  a  complete  list  of  the  different  ways  in  which  under- 
standing unites  ideas  by  means  of  judgement ;  that  is 
to  say,  it  is  a  complete  list  of  the  functions  of  the 
understanding.1 

The  interest  and  importance  of  the  passage  depends,  not 
so  much  on  its  obvious  conclusion  (granting  Kant's  pre- 
suppositions), as  on  the  doctrine  of  the  concept  and  the  judge- 
ment which  is  implied  in  it. 

§4.  The  Concept 

Concepts  are  grounded  on  the  spontaneity  of  thought,  as 
sensuous  intuitions  are  grounded  upon  the  receptivity  of  sense.2 
What  does  this  mean  ? 

According  to  Kant,  a  creative  intelligence  is  conceivable, 
which  by  its  own  activity  would  create  intuitions ;  these  would 
be  what  he  calls  intellectual  intuitions.  Human  beings  receive 
their  intuitions  passively.  This  is  why  human  intuitions  are 
called  sensuous,  and  are  said  to  be  grounded  on  receptivity.3 

Concepts,  on  the  other  hand,  are  due  to  the  activity  or 
spontaneity  of  understanding.  In  other  words,  understanding 
produces  concepts,4  and  concepts  spring  from  understanding.5 
This  tells  us  nothing  as  to  the  way  in  which  understanding 
produces  concepts,  but  we  have  seen6  that  concepts  are  made, 
as  regards  their  form,  by  comparison,  reflexion,  and  abstraction.7 
This  is  the  account  offered  by  Formal  Logic. 

1  A  69  =  B  94.  'The  functions  of  the  understanding  can,  therefore, 
be  discovered  if  we  can  give  a  complete  list  of  the  functions  of  unity 
in  judgements.' 

2  A  68  =  B  93.  Kant  says  'of  impressions*,  but  this  destroys  the 
parallelism  with  the  spontaneity  of  thought.  Compare  also  A  19=  B  33 
and  A  50  =  B  74. 

3  This  receptivity  is  identified  with  sensibility  in  A  51   =   B  75. 
For  Kant  Sensuous*  as  applied  to  intuitions  means  'passively  received*. 

4  In  A  51   —  B  75  Kant  says  understanding  produces  ideas,  and 
these  may  perhaps  include  the  ideas  produced  by  imagination,  but 
the  ideas   produced   by  understanding   in  the   narrower  sense   are 
concepts.  5A  19  =  B  33.

aso  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  4 

Kant  may  not  intend  to  make  his  own  view  more  precise 
when  he  informs  us  that  intuitions,  as  sensuous,  rest  on  affec- 
tions, and  concepts  on  functions;  but,  if  so,  it  is  odd  that  he 
goes  on  immediately  to  assert  that  by  'function'  he  means 
the  unity  of  the  act  of  ordering  different  ideas  under  one 
common  idea.1  This  act  is  an  act  of  judgement,  and  it  looks 
as  if  'function'  is  to  be  taken  here  in  its  technical  sense  as 
equivalent  to  'form  of  judgement'. 

I  do  not  want  to  make  too  much  of  this,  but  in  view  of 
what  follows2  we  are  bound  to  consider  such  an  interpretation. 
Kant  appears  to  be  saying  at  least  this,  that  the  act  of  abstraction 
or  analysis*  whereby  we  make  a  concept4  is  a  judgement;5 
and  if  to  conceive  is  essentially  to  think  in  abstraction  what 
is  common  to  a  plurality  of  possible  individual  instances, 
his  assertion  seems  to  be  true.6 


1  This  common  idea  must  be  a  concept. 

2  Especially  in  A  79  =  B  104-5.  It  must  be  remembered  that  the 
whole  of  the  present  passage  is  offered  to  us  as  a  preparation  for  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction. 

3  See  again  Chapters  IX  §  6  and  X  §  7  (at  the  end),  and  note  the 
word  'analytisch*  in  A  76  =   B  102  and  A  78  =  B  104.  It  is  all- 
important  to  recognise  here  that  the  act  in  question  is  the  act  of 
analysis  (not  the  act  of  synthesis)  which  is  present  in  all  judgement 
as  such. 

4  If   I   am   right,  this   is   also   the   act   present   in    thinking   any 
concept. 

6  It  would  seem  to  be  a  problematic  judgement.  Kant  himself  in 
A  75  n.  =  B  100  n.  connects  understanding  as  a  power  of  conceiving 
with  problematic  judgements;  and  this  view  is  supported  by  the 
doctrine  that  a  concept  is  essentially  the  predicate  of  a  possible 
judgement  (A  69  =  B  94).  It  will  be  remembered  that  understanding 
in  the  wider  sense  covers  (i)  understanding  in  the  narrower  sense 
(the  power  of  conceiving),  (2)  the  power  of  judgement  (that  is,  of 
assertoric  judgement),  and  (3)  the  power  of  reason  (or  judgement 
by  mediate  inference).  See  Chapter  IX  §  2. 

6  A  doctrine  of  this  kind  is  already  set  forth  in  one  of  Kant's  early 
works,  Die  falsche  Spitzfindigkeit  der  vier  Syllogistischen  Figuren 
(II  58-9).  The  relevant  passage  is  translated  by  Kemp  Smith, 
Commentary,  pp.  181-2.  There  Kant  is  dealing  only  with  'distinct* 
concepts  (that  is,  concepts  made  up  of  'marks'  which  are  'clear'); 
and  he  blames  logicians  for  discussing  'distinct'  concepts  before 
dealing  with  judgements,  although  a  'distinct'  concept  is  possible 


XII  §5]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  251 

The  same  doctrine  seems  to  be  implied  in  Kant's  statement 
that  all  the  acts  of  understanding  can  be  reduced  to  judge- 
ment.1 The  obvious  objection  to  this  is  that  the  act  of  con- 
ceiving is  a  different  act  from  the  act  of  judging.  Kant  meets 
this  objection  by  asserting  that  it  is  as  predicates  of  possible 
judgements  that  concepts  relate  to  some  idea  (ultimately  to 
some  intuition)  of  an  object  as  yet  undetermined.  Indeed  he 
affirms  that  a  concept  is  a  concept  only  because  it  contains 
under  it  other  ideas  (ultimately  intuitions),  by  means  of  which 
it  can  relate  to  objects.2  This  implies  that  it  is  a  concept  only 
as  the  predicate  of  a  possible  judgement.3 

To  say  that  concepts  are  essentially  predicates  of  possible 
judgements  is  to  say  that  conceiving  is  really  judging.  Concepts 
do  not  precede  judgement,  but  rather  are  abstractions  from 
judgement.  If  so,  they  must  rest  upon  the  form  of  judgement; 
and  this  may  turn  out  to  be  of  importance  later. 

§  5.  The  Judgement 

Kant's  discussion  of  concepts  has  as  its  immediate  purpose 
the  establishment  of  the  conclusion  that  the  functions  of  under- 
standing are  identical  with  the  forms  of  judgement.  This 
conclusion  is  reached  (with  the  help  of  presuppositions  drawn 

only  by  means  of  judgement.  He  also  maintains  there  that  under- 
standing and  reason  are  ultimately  the  same  power.  Both  are  a  power 
of  judging,  but  reason  is  a  power  of  judging  mediately,  that  is,  of 
inferring. 

1  A  69  -  B  94. 

2  It  should  be  noted  that  the  predicate-concept  is  related  to  intuitions 
by  means  of  the  subject-concept.  I  do  not  examine  this  complication 
here,  because  we  shall  have   to  consider  it  presently  in  connexion 
with  judgement. 

3  Kant's   principle   holds   even  for  concepts  which  are   subject- 
concepts.  In  'All  bodies  are  divisible'  the  subject-concept  is  'body', 
but  'body*  is  also  the  predicate  of  a  possible  judgement.  See  A  69  = 
B  94,  and  also  Nachlass  4634  (XVII  616),  where  every  judgement 
is  said  to  have  two  predicates  which  we  compare  with  one  another. 
'When  I  say  "A  body  is  divisible",  this  means:  "something  X,  which 
I  know  through  the  predicates  that  together  constitute  a  concept 
of  body,  I  think  also  through  the  predicate  of  divisibility".' 


252  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION       [XII  §  5 

from  Formal  Logic)  on  the  ground  that  conceiving  is  judging ; 
and  that  all  the  acts  of  the  understanding  can  be  reduced  to 
judgement. 

There  is  a  further  point  to  be  made — that  the  functions 
of  the  understanding  (or  the  forms  of  judgement)  are  the 
ways  in  which  understanding  unites  ideas.  Here  again  Kant 
takes  his  general  doctrine  of  the  forms  of  judgement  for  granted. 
His  discussion  of  judgement  is  concerned,  not  with  the  separate 
forms  of  judgement,  but  with  what  he  believes  to  be  the  general 
nature  of  judgement  as  a  whole.  If  the  essence  of  judgement 
is  to  unify,  the  different  forms,  it  is  assumed,  will  be  the  different 
ways  of  unifying. 

The  only  use  that  understanding  can  make  of  concepts  is 
to  judge  by  their  means,1  and  in  judging  we  refer  a 
concept  to  an  object.2  But  no  idea  other  than  an  intuition  is 
immediately  related  to  an  object.  Hence  when  in  judgement 
we  refer  the  concept  to  an  object,  we  do  so  by  means  of 
intuition. 

Judgement,  therefore,  since  it  must  employ  concepts,  is 
discursive  or  mediate,3  and  not  intuitive,4  cognition. 

So  far  I  have  spoken  as  if  there  were  only  one  concept  in 
a  judgement,  and  as  if  this  concept  were  referred  to  a  sensible 
reality — a  doctrine  reminiscent  of  Mr.  Bradley.  Kant,  however, 
recognises  a  distinction  between  subject  and  predicate,  and 
consequently  recognises  what  may  be  called  a  double  mediation 
in  judgement.  The  concept  may  refer  to  an  object,  not  only 
by  means  of  an  intuition,  but  also  by  means  of  another  concept. 
The  predicate-concept  is  referred  to  the  object  by  means  of 

1  A  68  =  B  93. 

2  Presumably  also  to  a  number  (or  to  a  class)  of  objects. 

8  Kant  expresses  this  by  saying  also  that  judgement  is  the  idea 
of  an  idea  of  an  object,  and  such  a  statement  may  seem  artificial.  It 
is,  however,  only  another  way  of  asserting  that  in  judgement  we  refer 
a  concept  to  an  object  by  means  of  another  idea  (ultimately  by  means 
of  intuition).  Compare  the  account  of  thought  in  A  19  =  B  33. 

4  As  we  have  seen,  mathematical  judgements  may  nevertheless  be 
called  intuitive,  in  the  sense  that  in  them  intuition  plays  a  prominent 
part.  See  Chapter  X  §  7. 


XII  §  5]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  253 

the  subject-concept,  which  is  assumed  to  refer  immediately1 
to  the  object. 

At  this  stage  we  approach  the  crucial  point  of  Kant's  dis- 
cussion, namely  the  sense  in  which  (according  to  Formal 
Logic)  judgement  is  supposed  to  unify  ideas. 

Kant  gives  us  an  example  of  what  he  means.  In  the  judge- 
ment 'All  bodies  are  divisible',  the  concept  of  divisibility, 
which  is  applicable  to  other  things2  than  bodies,  is  referred 
in  particular  to  the  concept  of  body,  and  the  concept  of  body 
is  referred  to  certain  intuitions3  which  present  themselves  to 
us.  Taking  this  example  as  typical  of  all  judgements,  Kant 
asserts  that  every  judgement  is  essentially  an  act  which  produces 
unity  in  our  ideas.4  Instead  of  using  an  immediate  idea5  (e.g. 
the  subject-concept  of  'body')  for  the  purpose  of  knowing 
the  object,6  it  uses  a  'higher  idea'  (e.g.  the  predicate-concept 
of  'divisibility')  which  comprehends7  under  it  the  subject- 
concept  and  other  concepts;8  and  in  this  way  many  possible 
cognitions  are  gathered  into  one. 

1  This  immediacy  is  of  course  only  relative.  The  subject-concept 
can  refer  to  the  object  only  by  means  of  intuition,  but  it  refers  directly 
to  the  intuition,  whereas  the  predicate-concept  is  referred  to  the 
intuition  by  means  of  the  subject-concept. 

2  Kant  says  'other  concepts*,  but  the  concept  of  divisibility  strictly 
applies  to  the  things  thought  under  these  concepts. 

3  The  text  says  Appearances'  (Erscheinungeri)>  but  this  is  obviously 
a  slip  or  misprint  corrected  by  Kant,  Nachtrdge  XXXVI.  See  edition  of 
Raymund  Schmidt,  note  on  A  69  =  B  93. 

4  I  express  this  in  my  own  words.  Kant  says  'All  judgements  are 
functions  of  unity  in  our  ideas'. 

6  Kant  does  not  say  whether  he  means  the  strictly  immediate 
intuition  of  a  body  or  the  relatively  immediate  concept  of  'body'. 
I  think  he  must  mean,  primarily  at  least,  the  latter.  The  concept  of 
'body'  is  relatively  immediate  because  it  is  the  subject-concept  of 
the  judgement  in  question. 

6  There  is  no  special  significance  attached  to  the  singular  'object'. 
Compare  the  preceding  sentence:  'These  objects  are  mediately  repre- 
sented through  the  concept  of  "divisibility".' 

7  'begreift.'  The  word  is  appropriate  to  a  concept  (Begriff). 

8  Here  again  Kant  says  simply  'that  which  comprehends  under 
it  this  (immediate  idea)  and  others'.  He  may  be  referring,  not  only 
to  the  subject-concept  and  other  concepts,  but  also  to  the  intuitions 
of  divisible  objects  which  fall  under  the  concept  of  'body*  and  other 
concepts  as  well  as  under  the  concept  of  'divisibility'. 


254  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  5 

This  statement  is  of  cardinal  importance  for  the  argument, 
yet  it  is  unfortunately  obscure.  In  what  professes  to  give  a 
description  of  all  judgements,  we  ought  to  consider  judgements 
other  than  categorical,1  even  if  we  believe  that  hypothetical 
and  disjunctive  judgements  are  in  a  sense  made  up  of  categorical 
judgements.2  As  regards  categorical  judgements  themselves,  it 
is  necessary  to  recognise  that  in  them  we  may  use  our  own 
ideas  as  objects,3  and  that  a  mere  abstraction  may  be  the 
subject  of  a  judgement.  Kant's  example  is  a  very  special  kind 
of  categorical  judgement,  in  which  not  only  does  the  subject- 
concept  refer  to  concrete  physical  things,  but  the  predicate- 
concept  is  taken  to  be  'higher'4  than  the  subject-concept;  and 
this  is  by  no  means  necessary.5 

It  must,  however,  be  remembered  that  Kant  is  not  writing 
a  treatise  on  Formal  Logic,  and  his  theory  may  be  sound 
even  if  his  example  is  inadequate  and  is  described  in  a  way 
which  does  not  fit  the  general  case.  What  we  really  want  to 
know  is  the  sense  in  which  'many  cognitions  are  gathered 
together  in  one'  when  we  judge. 

Every  categorical  judgement  may  be  said  to  unite  its  subject 
and  predicate,  but  this  is  manifestly  not  Kant's  primary 
meaning.  We  have  always  to  face  the  difficulty  that  he  describes 
as  cognitions,  and  even  as  intuitions,  what  on  a  realistic  assump- 
tion would  be  described  as  things.  I  believe  him  to  mean 
that  instead  of  intuiting  each  body  separately,  we  gather 
together  our  different  intuitions  of  many  individual  bodies 

1  Compare  B  141. 

2  Kant  does  believe  this  in  a  sense,  but  he  considers  that  hypothetical 
and  disjunctive  judgements  involve  distinct  forms  of  thought. 

3  The  object  is  here  simply  the  subject  of  the  judgement. 

4  The  term  'higher*  or  'wider*  is  applied  most  appropriately  to 
cases  of  genus  and  species.  The  concept  'animal*  is  higher  than  the 
concept  'man',  and  this  in  turn  is  higher  than  the  concept  'negro*. 
We  get  a  similar  series  in  'thing*,  'substance*,  'body',  'metal*,  'iron*. 
'Divisibility*  is  not  a  genus  of  which  'body*  is  a  species,  and  'body* 
is  not  contained  under  'divisibility*  as  it  is  contained  under  'substance* ; 
it  has,  however,  a  wider  denotation,  and  this   may  be   the   reason 
why  it  is  here  called  higher.  Compare  Log.  §§  9-13  (IX  96-8). 

6  E.g.  in  the  judgement  'Some  divisible  things  are  bodies*. 


XII  §  si          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  255 

under  the  concept  of  divisibility.  More  simply,  we  unite 
different  individual  bodies  before  our  minds  by  means  of 
their  common  mark  of  divisibility.1  This  we  do  by  an  act 
of  analysis. 

Kant's  broad  contention  is  this — that  to  judge  is  essentially 
to  think  a  plurality  of  sensible  individuals  by  means  of  universal 
or  general  concepts.  Just  as  he  maintained  that  conceiving  is 
judging,  so  now  he  maintains  that  judging  (whatever  else  it 
is)  is  conceiving.  What  we  have  to  consider  is  this  highly 
general  doctrine :  his  account  of  the  part  played  by  the  subject- 
and  predicate-concepts  clearly  demands  modification,  if  it  is 
to  fit  all  the  different  types  of  judgement. 

Even  the  general  doctrine  is  by  no  means  free  from  difficulty. 
Yet  I  do  not  see  that  it  is  incompatible  with  the  recognition 
of  the  different  forms  of  judgement  set  forth  in  Formal  Logic, 
or  even  with  the  recognition  of  different  forms  which,  as  I 
have  suggested,2  may  be  present  in  all  judgement  as  such. 
It  can,  I  think,  be  argued  that  every  judgement  makes  use  of 
universal  concepts;3  and  that  to  conceive  a  universal  is  to 
think  a  mark  which  belongs,  at  least  potentially,  to  a  plurality 
of  individuals,4  even  if  we  apply  it  in  a  singular  judgement.6 
The  assumption  that  in  the  last  resort  these  individuals  must 
be  sensible  may  seem  more  difficult  to  defend;6  but  I  think 

1  As  Kant  himself  says,  these  objects  (that  is,  bodies)  are  mediately 
represented  through  the  concept  of  divisibility  (A  69  =  B  93-4).  The 
word  'mediately'  presumably  refers  both  to  the  fact  that  we  use  the 
concept  of  body  and  also  to  the  fact  that  the  concept  of  body  refers 
to  sensuous  intuitions.  2  See  Chapter  X  §  5. 

3  Certain  types  of  judgement  (e.g.  'Tully  is  Cicero*)  offer  difficulties 
in  the  way  of  this  contention.  These  difficulties  might,  I  think,  be 
evaded ;  but  in  any  case  it  would  be  absurd  to  suggest  that  this  doctrine 
applies  only  to  categorical  judgements,   and  still  more  absurd  to 
suggest  that  it  applies  only  to  one  type  of  categorical  judgements. 

4  There    are    difficulties    here    in    regard    to    such    concepts    as 
'omnipotence*.  6  Compare  B  133-4  n« 

6  When  we  say  *  Honesty  is  admirable',  the  sensuous  element  is 
reduced  to  a  minimum.  Perhaps  Kant  would  still  maintain  that  we 
were,  in  the  last  resort,  referring  to  individual  acts  of  which  we  have 
some  sensuous  cognition.  His  main  interest,  however,  is  in  our  know- 
ledge of  the  physical  world. 


256  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  6 

this  too  could  be  defended,  although  I  should  have  thought 
that  it  was  irrelevant  to  Formal  Logic. 

In  spite  of  difficulties  it  is  not  unplausible  to  maintain  that 
all  judgement  makes  use  of  universal  or  general  concepts  for 
the  purpose  of  knowing,  directly  or  indirectly,  a  world  of 
sensible  individual  objects;1  and  even  that  (whatever  else  it 
may  do)  it  gives  unity  to  a  plurality  of  different  individual 
objects,2  so  far  as  these  individual  objects  are  thought  by 
means  of  a  common  mark  (or  marks).  The  unity  so  given 
may  be  called  an  'analytic  unity',  a  unity  dependent  on  an 
act  of  analysis.3  This  has  nothing  to  do  with  analytic  judge- 
ments, or  indeed  with  any  special  kind  of  judgement.4  Whether 
Kant  is  right  or  wrong,  a  failure  to  see  that  he  at  least  professes 
to  describe  all  judgements  without  exception  is  bound  to  lead 
— and  has  indeed  too  often  led — to  a  complete  distortion  of 
his  argument. 

§  6.  The  Categories 

The  whole  argument  so  far  is  only  a  preparation  for  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction:  it  states,  and  perhaps  in  some  ways 
corrects,  the  doctrines  of  Formal  Logic  on  which  that  Deduction 
is  based.  In  particular  it  leads  up  to  the  list  of  forms  of  judge- 
ment which  is  supposed  to  give  us  the  clue  to  the  categories. 
Kant  would  have  helped  us  greatly  if  he  had  also  given  us 
at  this  stage  a  clear  statement  of  what  he  means  by  categories, 
and  why  he  describes  them  in  so  many  different  ways,  the 
connexion  between  which  is  at  first  by  no  means  easy  to  see. 

1  Compare  A  19  =  B  33:  'All  thought  must,  whether  directly  or 
indirectly,  by  way  of  certain  marks,  relate  ultimately  to  intuitions.' 

2 1  think  this  is  what  Kant  means  when  he  says  (in  A  79  =  B  104) 
that  'the  same  function*  'gives  unity  to  the  different  ideas  in  a 
judgement*. 

8  See  A  79  =  B  105  and  B  133-4  n-  Compare  also  Chapters  IX  §  6, 
X  §  7  (at  end)  and  XIV  §  6.  The  act  of  analysis  is  the  act  present  in 
all  conception  as  such. 

4  In  the  different  forms  of  judgement  objects  may  be  united  in 
different  ways,  but  they  are  all  supposed  to  be  united  in  virtue  of  an 
analysis  of  common  characteristics. 


XII  §  6]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  257 

I  will  attempt  to  make  good  this  omission  even  at  the  risk 
of  being  imperfectly  understood  until  the  argument  has  been 
developed  further. 

From  its  beginnings  in  Aristotle  the  science  of  metaphysics 
had  been  concerned  with  the  real  as  such.  Its  aim  was  to 
deduce  the  detailed  nature  of  the  universe  from  some  central 
principle,1  and  in  so  doing  it  concerned  itself  with  pure  forms 
apart  from  their  connexion  with  matter.2  By  the  time  of  Kant 
one  of  the  main  parts  of  metaphysics — if  we  may  take  the 
writings  of  Baumgarten  as  a  guide — was  called  Ontology,  and 
was  concerned  with  the  more  general  or  abstract  predicates 
of  the  thing.3  Some  of  these  predicates  are  universal  predicates, 
predicates  which  belong  to  all  things.4 

These  universal  predicates  are  not  called  categories  by 
Baumgarten.  The  word  'category'  was  revived  or  reintroduced 
by  Kant  on  the  analogy  of  the  Aristotelian  categories.5  The 
Aristotelian  categories  are  a  list  of  the  widest  predicates  which 
are  predicable  essentially  of  the  various  namable  entities.6 
There  are  differences  between  the  sense  in  which  Aristotle 
uses  the  word  and  the  sense  in  which  it  is  used  by  Kant,  but 
these  differences  do  not  concern  us  here. 

If  we  use  the  term  'category*  for  the  universal  predicates 
of  Baumgarten,  we  may  say  that  the  categories  are  the  ultimate 
predicates  which  universally  and  necessarily  apply  to  every 
thing  so  far  as  it  is  a  thing.  As  universal  and  necessary,  the 
categories  are  pure  or  a  priori,  and  we  might  call  them  'pure 
concepts  of  a  thing  in  general9. 

Kant  believes  that  it  is  impossible  to  have  a  priori  knowledge 
of  the  universal  and  necessary  character  of  things ',  if  we  suppose 
these  things  to  be  things-in-themselves.  We  can  have  a  priori 
knowledge  by  means  of  the  categories,  only  if  the  categories 
are  due  to  the  nature  of  the  mind  and  are  imposed  by  the

258  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  6 

mind  on  the  objects  which  it  knows.  Kant's  metaphysic  there- 
fore, while  retaining  many  of  the  ideals  of  the  older  metaphysics, 
ceases  to  be  a  speculative  metaphysic  concerned  with  reality 
as  such.  It  becomes  instead  a  Metaphysic  of  Experience,  and 
is  concerned  with  the  universal  and  necessary  characteristics 
of  objects  of  experience,  so  far  as  they  are  objects  of  experience. 
Hence  for  him  the  categories  are  pure  concepts,  not  of  a  thing 
in  general,  but  of  'an  object  in  general'.1 

When  we  consider  what  an  object  in  general  essentially  is, 
we  shall  find  that  it  consists  of  a  sensible  matter  held  together 
in  a  necessary  synthetic  unity.2  It  is  this  necessary  synthetic 
unity  which  constitutes  the  universal  and  necessary  character 
of  any  and  every  object;  the  matter  may  vary  indefinitely. 
Hence  the  more  exact  description  of  a  category  is  that  it  is 
a  pure  concept  of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  is  present 
in  every  object  of  experience? 

So  far  the  doctrine  offers  little  difficulty.  Kant,  however, 
believes  that  this  necessary  synthetic  unity  is  imposed  on  the 
given  sensible  matter  by  an  act  of  synthesis  which  is  always 
the  same  whatever  be  the  special  character  of  the  matter 
synthetised  ;4  and  he  believes  that  a  concept  of  an  object  is 
also — it  might  be  better  to  say  'includes'  or  'involves' — a 
concept  of  the  synthesis  whereby  such  an  object  can  be  con- 
structed.5 Hence  he  regards  the  category,  not  only  as  a  concept 
of  an  object  in  general,  but  also  as  a  concept  of  synthesis  in 
general?  a  concept  of  that  synthesis  which  is  necessary  to

synthetised  as  substances  with  accidents,  however  much  they  may 
vary  as  regards  the  matter  given  to  sense. 

6  For  example,  the  concept  of  a  circle  is,  or  includes,  a  concept  of 
the  synthesis  by  which  a  circle  can  be  constructed :  a  circle  is  essentially 
a  figure  which  can  be  constructed  in  a  certain  way.  The  construction 
in  question  is  an  imaginative  construction,  but  must  be  based  on 
given  intuitions  if  we  are  to  have  a  real  object  before  us. 

6  We  might  call  it,  more  elaborately,  a  concept  of  the  "synthesis 
of  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general \  compare  A  79  =  B  104-5 
and  Chapter  XIV  §  3. 


XII  §  6]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  259 

construct  any  and  every  object  and  to  impose  such  synthetic  unity 
as  constitutes  the  essential  character  of  any  object  qud  object. 

Kant's  account  of  this  synthesis  is  complicated  and  difficult. 
The  synthesis  is  a  synthesis  of  intuitions  and  is  the  work  of 
imagination,  but  according  to  Kant  it  must  conform  to  the 
principles  of  intellectual  synthesis  present  in  judgement.  These 
principles  are  implicit  in  the  forms  of  judgement,  and  they  are 
supposed  to  control1  the  imaginative  synthesis.  If  an  object 
is  to  be  an  object,  it  must  be  judged,  and  the  imaginative 
synthesis  must  combine  the  given  manifold  in  such  a  way 
that  it  can  be  judged  under  the  various  forms  of  judgement. 
The  categories  are  therefore  said  to  be  the  forms  of  judgement 
— I  think  it  would  be  better  to  say  concepts  of  the  forms  of 
judgement2 — so  far  as  the  manifold  of  a  given  intuition  is  deter- 
mined* in  conformity  with  them.1  This  is  stated  with  many 
variations  into  which  we  need  not  at  present  enter.5  Curiously 
enough,  the  one  place  where  it  is  not  stated,  but  merely  sug- 
gested,8 is  just  where  it  ought  to  have  been  stated,  namely 
in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction. 

The  imaginative  synthesis  which  is  controlled  by  the  forms 
of  judgment  is  essentially  a  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  of 
time  and  space:  because  it  imposes  synthetic  unity  on  the 
manifold  of  time  and  space,  it  also  imposes  synthetic  unity  on 
the  manifold  given  under  the  forms  of  time  and  space.  Conse- 
quently the  category  is  described  as  a  concept  of  pure  synthesis.1 

These  different  descriptions  of  the  categories — as  concepts 
of  an  object  in  general,  concepts  of  necessary  synthetic  unity,

7  In  A  78-9  =  B  104-5  the  concept  is  regarded  as  a  concept  of 
the  pure  synthesis  and  also  as  a  concept  of  the  unity  of  the  pure 
synthesis,  but  I  do  not  think  that  this  is  a  substantial  distinction: 
the  category  might  also  be  said  to  be  a  concept  of  the  rule  of  the  pure 
synthesis. 


26o  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XII  §  7 

concepts  of  the  forms  of  judgment,  and  concepts  of  pure 
synthesis — may  suggest  that  Kant  is  using  the  word  in  different 
and  confused  senses.  We  must,  however,  entertain  the  possi- 
bility that  his  meaning  may  become  more  intelligible  as  we 
advance.  At  present  we  can  note  only  the  distinction  involved 
in  the  last  two  descriptions. 

§  7.  The  Schematised  Categories 

The  categories  as  concepts  of  the  forms  of  judgement1  are 
pure  categories.  As  such  they  are  said  to  be  'empty',  in  the 
sense  that  their  content  is  the  empty  forms  of  thought,  or 
forms  of  judgement,  through  which  no  determinate  object  is 
known.2  They  do  indeed  relate  to  an  object  in  general;  and 
since  they  are  forms  of  discursive  or  conceptual  thought,  they, 
so  to  speak,  await  an  object  to  be  given  in  some  sort  of  sensuous 
intuition — which  Kant  calls  intuition  in  general.  For  us,  however, 
they  must  be  related  to  human  intuition,  which  is  given  under 
the  form  of  time.  It  is  only  when  translated  into  terms  of  time,3 
that  the  categories  can  be  said  to  have  meaning;  that  is,  to 
have  as  their  content  the  necessary  and  universal  characteristics 
of  objects  of  human  experience,  and  not  merely  the  empty  forms 
of  judgement.  As  so  translated  into  terms  of  time  they  are 
no  longer  pure  categories,  but  schematised  categories.  It  is  as 
schematised  that  the  categories  are  concepts  of  the  pure 
synthesis.4 

Thus  the  pure  category  of  ground  and  consequent,  which 
is  thought  in  the  hypothetical  form  of  judgement,  has  no 

1  Here,  as  always,  we  must  understand  'the  forms  of  judgement 
as  applied  to  and  determining  intuitions' :  it  seems  undesirable  to  repeat 
this  qualification  every  time  the  phrase  is  used. 

2  Compare  B  150  and  A  245. 

8  Compare  Caird,  The  Philosophy  of  Kant,  p.  407,  and  The  Critical 
Philosophy  of  Kant,  Vol.  I,  p.  441. 

4  Yet  even  the  pure  categories,  being  concepts  of  the  synthesis  of 
the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general,  must  also  be  in  a  sense  concepts 
of  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  pure  intuition.  The  first  synthesis 
is  the  genus,  and  the  second  a  species  of  the  genus.  Compare 
Chapter  XIII  §  6. 


XII  §  7]          CONCEPTION  AND  JUDGEMENT  261 

reference  to  time ;  and  even  if  we  think  of  it  as  applying  some- 
how to  objects  given  in  intuition,  this  thought  is  so  vague  as 
to  be  called  empty.  If  it  is  translated  into  terms  of  time,  it 
becomes  the  schematised  category  of  cause  and  effect,  that  is, 
of  a  consequent  which  necessarily  succeeds  its  ground  in  time. 
The  thought  that  all  changes  in  objects  of  experience  must 
be  causally  determined  is  very  far  from  empty ;  and  if  it  could 
be  proved,  as  Kant  believes  it  can,  it  would  be  an  important 
addition  to  metaphysical  truth. 

For  a  clear  understanding  of  this  side  of  Kant's  thought, 
we  must  await  the  further  development  of  a  long  and  compli- 
cated argument.  The  details  will  not  be  given  to  us  until  we 
reach  the  chapter  on  Schematism,  and  this  is  one  of  the  main 
reasons  for  the  difficulty  of  Kant's  Deduction  as  a  whole.  It 
is,  however,  all-important  to  recognise  from  the  first  that  the 
reference  to  time  is  not  a  late  interpolation,  but  is  essential 
to  Kant's  argument. 

Apart  from  time,  there  could  be  no  Transcendental  Logic 
at  all.  There  could  only  be  a  Formal  Logic  concerned  with 
the  forms  of  judgement.  It  is  because  there  are  pure  as  well 
as  empirical  intuitions  that  there  can  be  a  difference  between 
pure  and  empirical  thought  of  objects.1  For  the  same  reason 
we  are  able  to  have  a  Transcendental  Logic  which  does  not 
abstract  wholly  from  the  content  of  cognition,  but  confines 
itself  to  a  priori  knowledge  and  excludes  empirical  knowledge.2 
It  is  because  Transcendental  Logic  has  a  manifold  of  pure 
sensibility  before  it,  as  set  forth  in  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic, 
that  it  has  any  content:  apart  from  this  the  pure  concepts 
with  which  it  deals  would  be  without  any  content,  and  would 
be  completely  empty.3  Kant  is  as  clear  and  explicit  on  this 
point  as  a  man  could  be.  If  we  fail  to  recognise  this  truth  as 
absolutely  essential  to  his  whole  argument,  the  Kritik  of  Pure 
Reason  is  to  us  no  better  than  a  sealed  book. 

1  Compare  A  55  =  B  79-80. 

8  Except  in  so  far  as  it  considers  the  a  priori  knowledge  which  is 
present  in  all  empirical  knowledge. 

3  A  76-7  =  B  1 02.  It  would  perhaps  be  more  correct  to  say  that 
their  content  would  be  the  empty  forms  of  judgement. 


CHAPTER    XIII 
CONCEPTION  AND   SYNTHESIS 

§  i.  Pure  Intuition  and  the  Categories 

Kant  begins  his  Metaphysical  Deduction  proper  by  calling 
attention  to  the  fact  that  the  categories  must  be  schematised. 
The  pure  categories,  if  they  are  not  to  be  empty,  must  have 
a  'stuff'  or  matter  given  to  them;  and  this  matter  must  also 
be  pure,  if  the  categories,  when  filled,  are  to  be  pure  concepts. 
Such  a  pure  matter  is  given  in  space1  and  time,  for  these 
contain  a  manifold  of  pure  a  priori  intuition.  But  space  and 
time  are  also  forms  of  intuition;  they  are  conditions  under 
which  all  intuitions  of  objects  are  given  to  human  minds. 
Hence  space  and  time  are  bound  to  affect  the  character  of 
the  categories,  which  are  pure  concepts  of  objects  in  general. 
In  other  words,  the  categories  must  be  schematised;  that  is 
to  say,  they  must  cease  to  be  mere  empty  forms  of  judgement, 
and  must  receive  a  definite  content  from  their  relation  to 
space  and  time.  The  reason  why  they  can  do  so  is  this:  the 
spontaneity  of  thought,  which  is  manifested  in  the  forms  of 
judgement,  demands  that  the  pure  manifold  of  space  and  time 
should  be  'gone  through,  taken  up,  and  combined'2  in  a  certain 
way.  The  act  of  doing  this  is  called  synthesis,  and  it  is  Kant's 
contention  that  this  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  has  different 
aspects  corresponding  to,  and  imposed  by,  the  different  forms 
of  judgement. 

1  A  77  =  B  1 02.  Note  that  space,  which  becomes  more  prominent 
in  the  second  edition,  is  already  mentioned  here  as  on  an  equality 
with  time.  Note  also  that  just  as  sensibility  presents  a  pure  manifold 
of  space  and  time  to  thought,  so  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic  may 
be  said  to  present  a  pure  manifold  of  space  and  time  to  Transcendental 
Logic.  The  Critical  Philosophy  makes  explicit  in  reflexion  what  takes 
place  un reflectively  in  experience. 

2  These  phrases,  and  notably  'taken  up*,  are  connected  with  what 
Kant  calls  'apprehension';  see  A  120  and  A  99,  and  compare  B  160 
and  B  162. 


XIII  §2]          CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  263 

§  2.  The  Nature  of  Synthesis 

Kant  believes  that  synthesis  is  an  essential  element  in  all 
knowledge,  and  he  devotes  two  paragraphs  to  an  explanation 
of  what  he  means  by  synthesis  'in  its  most  general  sense'.1 
When  this  general  explanation  has  been  given,  he  will  return 
to  the  special  case  of  pure  synthesis,  which,  as  he  has  asserted, 
supplies  a  content  for  the  pure  categories. 

The  description  of  synthesis  in  general — and  even  the  account 
of  pure  synthesis — is  a  summary  statement  of  doctrines  which 
will  be  elaborated  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction.2  The 
lack  of  detail  is  natural,  and  even  necessary,  if  repetition  is  to 
be  avoided;  but  the  description  is  too  compact  to  be  easily 
intelligible,  and  some  of  the  assertions  may  give  a  false  impres- 
sion, unless  they  are  interpreted  in  the  light  of  what  comes 
later.  I  have  found  it  difficult  to  explain  Kant's  meaning  without 
becoming  involved  in  a  discussion  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction,  which  would  here  be  out  of  place;  and  the  reader 
must  be  warned  that  the  present  account  is  in  some  ways 
provisional  and  does  not  attempt  to  meet  objections  which 
might  very  reasonably  be  raised. 

In  the  second  of  the  two  paragraphs  under  consideration 
we  are  told  that  'synthesis  in  general'  is  the  mere  work  (or 
effect3)  of  imagination,  and  it  is  contrasted  with  the  work  (or 
function)  of  the  understanding  in  'bringing  the  synthesis  to 
concepts'.  From  this,  taken  by  itself,  we  might  conclude  that 
the  synthesis  of  imagination  is  wholly  independent  of  the  under- 
standing. Such  a  view  is  not  borne  out  by  the  Transcendental 
Deduction,  and  even  in  the  present  passage  there  are  perhaps 
indications  of  a  closer  connexion  between  the  two  active  powers 
of  the  mind.4  Furthermore  a  were  synthesis  of  the  imagination

2  Compare  A  78  =  B  103,  'as  we  shall  see  later'. 

8  '  Wirkung*  may  mean  either  'working5  or  'effect*. 

4  The  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold — which  ought  surely  to  fall 
under  the  general  case — is  demanded  by  'the  spontaneity  of  our 
thought'  (A  77  ~  B  102);  and  in  the  definition  of  synthesis  use  is 
made  of  the  word  'begreifen*  (to  'grasp*  or  'comprehend'),  which  may 


264  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIII  §  2 

would  seem  to  cover  casual  association  and  the  creative  activity 
of  the  artist,  but  Kant's  sole  concern  here  is  with  synthesis 
as  a  factor  in  knowledge  of  objects.  This  latter  synthesis  we 
shall  subsequently  know  as  the  'synthesis  of  apprehension',1 
and  we  shall  find  that  it  is  closely  bound  up  with  conception. 

Synthesis,  in  its  most  general  sense,  is  'the  act  of  adding 
different  ideas  to  one  another,  and  of  grasping  (or  compre- 
hending2) their  multiplicity  in  one  cognition'.  An  example  of 
the  kind  ot  act  which  Kant  has  in  view  would  be  the  act  of 
combining  a  series  of  given  appearances  into  the  complex 
intuition3  of  one  individual  house.  If  we  press  Kant's  subsequent 
statement  that  synthesis  is  the  mere  working  of  imagination, 
we  must  hold  that  the  concept  of  'house'  is  not  even  uncon- 
sciously at  work  in  the  synthesis,  and  a  fortiori  that  the  judge- 
ment 'This  is  a  house'  is  an  entirely  different  act.  Personally, 
I  believe  his  view  to  be  that  the  concept  of  'house'  is  at  work, 
even  if  unconsciously,  in  this  synthesis  of  imagination.  What 
Kant  has  in  mind  is  such  a  synthesis  of  imagination  as  must 
be  present  when  we  judge  that  this  is  a  house;  and  his  de- 
scription of  synthesis  'in  its  most  general  sense'  might  perhaps 
be  taken  to  cover  the  whole  complex  of  understanding  and 
imagination  necessarily  present  in  the  judgement  'This  is  a 
house'. 

The  latter  view  of  synthesis  is  at  any  rate  the  view  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction.4  On  this  interpretation  we  might 
be  tempted  to  identify  the  act  of  synthesis  with  the  act  of 
judgement  which  was  described  above6  as  'the  act  of  ordering 

suggest  the  presence  of  a  'Begriff*  (concept),  as  e.g.  in  A  68  =  B  93, 
Compare  also  A  103.  ' Zusammenfassen*  is  the  word  appropriate  to 
a  merely  imaginative  comprehension;  see  K.d.U.  §  26  (V  251). 

1  See  A  99-100,  A  120,  and  B  160.  The  synthesis  of  apprehension 
is  the  taking  up  and  combining  of  the  given  manifold  in  one  intuition. 

2  'begreifen: 

8  The  use  of  the  word  'intuition'  (or  even  *  image')  in  such  a  context 
does  not  imply  that  we  are  concerned  with  something  subjective.  I 
refrain  from  saying  *  complex  object*  only  because  the  object,  if  it  is 
to  be  strictly  an  object,  must  be  judged  and  not  merely  imagined 
or  sensed.  4  Compare  A  103  and  B  129-30. 

6  See  A  68  =  B  93  and  Chapter  XII  §§  2  and  4. 


XIII  §2]         CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  265 

different  ideas  under  one  common  idea'.  Such  an  identification 
would  be  a  mistake.  Both  acts  are  indeed,  on  this  interpretation, 
judgements;  but  in  describing  them  Kant  is  describing  two 
quite  different  aspects  or  implications  of  judgement.  The 
earlier  passage,  taken  in  its  context,  suggested  that  in  every 
judgement  a  plurality  of  individual  objects  is  brought  under 
a  common  mark  (or  marks);  it  was  in  fact  concerned  with 
judgement  as  involving  conception,  and  so  as  involving  an 
act  of  abstraction  or  analysis  by  which  we  think  the  common 
characteristics  of  different  individual  objects.  The  present 
passage  is  concerned  with  judgement  as  involving — at  any 
rate  when  we  know  physical  objects  by  its  means — a  synthesis 
of  different  intuitions  (or  given  appearances)  into  an  individual 
object  which  can  be  analysed.1  This  synthesis  is  divided  into 
two  processes — not  I  think  to  be  regarded  as  succeeding  one 
another — firstly  an  adding  of  different  ideas  (or  appearances) 
together,  and  secondly  a  grasping'  of  them  in  one  cognition 
by  means  of  a  concept.2 

We  may,  however,  prefer  to  suppose  at  the  present  stage, 
that  in  his  definition  of  synthesis  Kant  is  ignoring  the  act 
of  understanding  which  is  referred  to  later  as  *  bringing  the 
synthesis  to  concepts'.  In  that  case  synthesis  'in  its  most 
general  sense*  is  the  act  of  adding  different  ideas  to  one  another 
and  grasping  their  multiplicity  in  one  intuition.  In  certain 
respects  this  interpretation  is  better  suited  to  the  immediate 
context.  Even  so,  we  must  remember  that  the  synthesis  of 
imagination  in  question  is  that  which  is  present  in  apprehending 

1  E.g.  in  order  to  judge  that  this  is  a  house,  we  must  not  only 
recognise  by  means  of  analysis  the  marks  of  'houseness*  which  are 
common  to  this  house  and  other  houses;  we  must  also  by  an  act 
of  synthesis  hold  together  this  house  (and  perhaps  other  houses)  as 
a  single  complex  object  before  the  mind. 

2  The  one  'cognition*,  in  this  interpretation,  is  primarily  an  intuition ; 
for  the  many  appearances  or  intuitions  are  combined  into  one  complex 
intuition  (or  object)  such  as  a  house.  The  unity  of  the  complex  intuition 
depends,  however,  upon  our  concept  of  the  plan  by  which  many 
different  intuitions  are  combined  into  one  complex  intuition.  I  have 
no  doubt  that  this  is  Kant's  doctrine,  but  it  is  doubtful  whether  he 
wishes  to  make  it  explicit  in  the  present  provisional  exposition. 

VOL.  I  1* 


366  THE   METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION        [XIII  §  3 

a  real  object;  and  we  must  also  remember  that  apart  from 
judgement  it  does  not  give  us  knowledge  of  the  object. 

A  synthesis  is  pure  when  the  manifold  synthetised  is  given 
a  priori,  as  is  the  manifold  of  time  and  space ;  it  is  empirical 
when  the  manifold  is  given  in  sensuous  intuit  ion.  As  the  manifold 
of  sensuous  intuition  is  always  given  in  time  and  space,  every 
empirical  synthesis  must  involve  a  pure  synthesis  as  well.1 

§3.  Synthesis  and  Analysis 

Kant  now  proceeds  to  contrast  synthesis  with  analysis,  and 
to  maintain  that  synthesis  is  the  condition  of  analysis.2  Our 
synthesis  of  the  manifold  (whether  empirical  or  pure)  may  at 
first  give  us  a  cognition3  that  is  crude  and  indistinct  (or  con- 
fused)4. Analysis  may  be  needed  to  make  such  a  cognition 
distinct,  but  it  is  synthesis  which  gives  us  something  to  analyse. 
Apart  from  synthesis  we  should  have  mere  unrelated  elements ; 
we  should  not  have  anything  that  could  be  described  as  a 
determinate  content  to  be  analysed.  Without  some  determinate 
content  held  together  before  the  mind  there  could  be  no 
possibility  of  knowledge;  and  the  primary  origin  of  knowledge, 

1  Kant  would  have  made  his  doctrine  clearer,  if  he  had  stated  this 
point  explicitly  at  the  present  stage;  compare  A  99—100  and  A  102. 

2  Compare  B  130  and  also  B  133. 

3  This  'cognition*  is  not  'knowledge'  in  the  strict  sense,  if  synthesis 
is  the  work  of  mere  imagination. 

4  A  cognition  is  'crude*  (roh),  when  it  may  contain  error:  'crude* 
is  the  opposite  of  'exact*  or  'accurate*  (genau\  which  means  adequate 
to  the  object  and  wholly  free  from  error;  see  Log.  EM.  VII  (IX  54). 
A  cognition  is  'clear*  (klar)  as  opposed  to  'obscure*  (dunkel),  when 
we  are  consciously  aware  of  it  in  distinction  from  other  cognitions 
with  which  it  may  be  bound  up.  A  cognition  is  'distinct'  (deutlich) 
as  opposed  to  'indistinct*  (undeutlich),  when  its  parts  and  their  combina- 
tion in  the  whole  are  also  'clear*.  Kant  disapproves  of  the  common 
usage  whereby  'confused*  (verworren)  is  made  the  opposite  of  'distinct*, 
but  he  often  employs  this  terminology  himself.  An  indistinct  cognition 
is  made  distinct  by  analysis,  and  there  is  a  sensuous  distinctness  (of 
intuitions)  as  well  as  an  intellectual  distinctness   (of  concepts).  See 
Log.  EM.  V  and  VIII  (IX  33-4  and  61-2),  and  Anthr.  §§  5  and  6 
(VII  135,  137-8);  also   B  414-15  n.  Further  details  will  be  found 
in  Chapter  XIX  §  8. 


XIII  §  3]          CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  267 

so  far  as  knowledge  depends  on  the  activity  of  the  mind,  is 
to  be  found  in  synthesis,  not  in  analysis.1 

Kant  complicates  his  discussion  at  this  stage  by  raising 
questions  as  to  the  relation  between  analysis  and  conception: 
he  insists  that  the  content  (or  matter)  of  concepts  can  never 
arise  by  analysis. 

It  is  obvious  that  if  the  synthesis  of  imagination  gives  us 
a  complex  intuition  or  image,  we  can  proceed  to  analyse  the 
image,  to  make  its  parts  and  their  relation  to  one  another  clear, 
and  so  to  make  the  whole  image  distinct.  This  process  may 
be  carried  out  on  the  intuitive  level,2  and  it  does  not  produce 
either  the  form  or  the  matter  of  concepts. 

If  we  turn  to  the  origin  of  concepts,  we  have  already  seen3 
that,  according  to  Formal  Logic,  the  form  (or  universality) 
of  concepts  is  always  made  by  comparison,  reflexion,  and 
abstraction.  This  complicated  procedure  is  commonly  called 
'abstraction',  but  in  the  present  chapter  Kant  describes  it  as 
'analytic'.4  The  implication  of  his  assertions  is  that  while  the 
form  of  concepts  arises  by  a  procedure  which  may  be  described 
generally  as  analytic,  the  matter  of  concepts  cannot  arise  by 
such  a  procedure,  but  must  arise  by  an  act  of  synthesis. 

As  regards  the  form  of  concepts,  I  do  not  think  Kant's 
insistence  upon  the  analytic  procedure  of  the  mind  in  the 
making  (and  thinking)  of  concepts  as  such  should  be  taken 
to  add  anything  new  to  what  we  have  already  learned.  He  has 
maintained  that  to  conceive  is  essentially  to  think  a  plurality 

1  It  may  be  objected  that  synthesis  and  analysis  proceed  part  passu. 
In  a  sense  Kant  might  be  prepared  to  admit  this,  but  his  point  here 
is  that  in  an  indistinct  whole  we  may  hold  together  different  elements 
not  yet  distinguished  from  one  another.  This  is  obviously  true.  It 
seems  to  me  also  to  be  entirely  opposed  to  the  psychological  atomism 
of  Hume. 

2  It  may  be  maintained  that  conception  is  always  present  even  in 
awareness  and  analysis  of  images,  but  we  can  at  least  say  that  the 
conceptual  element  plays  a  subordinate  part.  An  illustration  given 
by  Kant  himself  is  looking  at  the  Milky  Way,  first  with  the  naked 
eye,  and  then  through  a  telescope.  See  Log.  EM.  V  (IX  35).

268  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION       [XIII  §  3 

of  individual  objects  by  means  of  a  common  mark  or  marks. 
He  is  now  maintaining  that  the  recognition  of  such  marks  as 
common  involves  analysis  of  the  given  objects  thought  under 
the  marks.  This  it  manifestly  does;  and  it  would  be  unfair 
to  object  that  mere  analysis  can  give  us  only  distinctness  in 
the  image,  and  not  a  general  concept.  Kant  is  alluding  to  an 
accepted  doctrine  of  Formal  Logic;  and  if  he  is  stressing  a 
special  aspect  of  that  doctrine,  or  even  if  he  is  calling  attention 
to  an  aspect  not  usually  recognised,  there  is  no  reason  to 
suppose  that  he  identifies  conceiving  with  the  act  of  analysing 
given  intuitions.1 

The  further  implication  of  Kant's  doctrine  is  that  the  matter 
of  concepts  depends  primarily  on  synthesis.  His  main  concern 
would  seem  to  be  with  complex  concepts,  such  as  the  concept 
of  'house'.2  If  we  are  to  abstract  the  features  common  to  this 
house  and  other  houses,  we  must  hold  together  this  house 
(and  perhaps  other  houses)  as  a  complex  individual  object 
before  the  mind.3  Kant  appears  to  have  in  view  the  making, 

1  The  form  or  universality  of  the  concept  does  not  depend  merely 
upon  our  finding  by  analysis  that  it  is  contained  in  our  intuition  or 
intuitions  as  a  part:  it  depends  essentially  on  our  act  of  using  it  as 
a  common  mark,  and  thereby  relating  it  to  a  plurality  of  objects. 
Compare  Log.  §  7  Anmerk.  and  Log.  §  5  Anmerk.  i  (IX  95  and  94). 
Kant's  doctrine  appears  to  be  that  by  analysis  we  find  'this  red*  to  be 
present  in  several  intuited  objects,  and  that  by  an  act  of  abstraction 
we  are  able  to  use  it  as  a  common  mark,  and  so  as  a  universal  idea. 
I  have  no  wish  to  conceal  the  difficulty  of  this  doctrine,  but  there 
is  surely  some  sense  in  saying  that  in  the  concept  of  'redness'  the 
matter  (red)  is  given,  while  the  form  or  universality  is  made.  The 
concept  of  'redness'  is  an  unduly  simple  illustration,  for  Kant  has 
in  view  for  the  most  part  complex  concepts,  such  as  the  concept  of 
'house',  where  the  structure  or  combination  of  marks  is  as  important 
as  the  given  marks  themselves. 

2  Nevertheless  even  a  simple  concept  like  'redness'  is  also  covered 
by  the  doctrine;  see  B  133-4  n.  Kant  does  not  of  course  deny  that 
this  red  and  that  red  must  be  given  to  sense,  but  he  insists  that  we 
must  synthetise  different  red  objects  if  we  are  by  analysis  to  acquire 
the  concept  of  redness  as  their  common  mark. 

8  We  must  also  hold  together  before  the  mind  a  set  of  individuals 
as  an  aggregate  or  whole,  and  this  too  is  an  act  of  synthesis;  but 
Kant  is  concerned  primarily  with  the  holding  together  of  the  complex 
individual  object  to  which  the  concept  refers. 


XIII  §  4]         CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  269 

or  perhaps  better  the  discovery,1  of  the  concept  as  regards 
its  matter  or  content ;  but  his  doctrine,  I  believe,  holds  whenever 
we  think  by  means  of  concepts.  In  thinking  of  individual 
houses  under  the  concept  of  'house',  we  require  not  only  an 
analysis  of  given  houses,  but  also  a  synthesis  whereby  we 
combine  given  intuitions  into  a  complex  intuition  of  this  or 
that  house.  The  necessity  for  analysis  was  generally  recognised, 
if  not  under  that  name,  at  any  rate  under  the  name  of  'abstrac- 
tion': the  necessity  for  synthesis  is  the  special  doctrine  of 
Kant  himself.  He  believes  that  both  analysis  and  synthesis 
must  be  present  in  all  our  judgements  about  objects. 

§  4.  Two  Factors  in  Knowledge 

Kant  recognises  that  his  account  of  synthesis  demands  a 
fuller  justification,  to  be  given  later.2  At  present  he  asserts 
that  synthesis  in  general  is  the  work  of  the  imagination  and  is 
a  necessary  condition  of  knowledge.  The  other  factor  in  know- 
ledge is  understanding,  which  'brings  the  synthesis  to  concepts'. 

Imagination  is  said  in  this  connexion  to  be  'a  blind  but 
indispensable  function3  of  the  soul,  of  which  we  are  scarcely 
ever  conscious'.  This  does  not  imply  that  we  are  never  conscious 
of  the  synthesis  of  imagination:  it  implies  on  the  contrary  that 
we  may  sometimes  be  conscious  of  this  synthesis.  Nor  does 
the  use  of  the  word  'blind'  imply  that  imagination  itself  is 
necessarily  unconscious.  Intuitions,  which  nobody  could  regard 

1  It  is  only  'factitious'  concepts  which  are  'made5  as  regards  their 
matter;  other  concepts  (whether  a  priori  or  empirical)  are  'given*  as 
regards  their  matter.  See  Lo#.§  4  (IX  93).  and  Chapter  IX  §§4  and  5. 
In  all  cases  synthesis — arbitrary  in  the  case  of  factitious  concepts, 
determined  by  the  nature  of  the  mind  in  the  case  of  a  priori  con- 
cepts, determined  by  the  nature  of  sensations  in  the  case  of  empirical 
concepts — is  the  necessary  condition  of  there   being  a  content  to 
analyse,  and  so  is  the  necessary  condition  of  the  act  of  analysis  or 
abstraction  by  which  concepts  are  made  as  regards  their  form. 

2  A  79  =  B  103 :  'Synthesis  in  general,  as  we  shall  see  later,  is.  .  .  .* 
8  Strictly  speaking,  imagination  is  a  'power':  its  work  is  a  'function*. 

Note  incidentally  that  in  Nachtrdge  XL  I  Kant  substitutes  'under- 
standing* for  'soul',  clearly  regarding  imagination  as  a  lower  form 
of  understanding. 


27Q  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIII  §4 

as  necessarily  unconscious,  are  also  said  to  be  blind — apart 
from  concepts.1  Imagination  is  in  general  a  conscious  activity, 
but  not  a  self-conscious  one;  in  imagination  we  have  some 
kind  of  awareness,  but  we  have  scarcely  ever  awareness  of 
the  nature  of  our  own  act.^ 

It  is  a  great  mistake  to  interpret  such  expressions  as  if 
Kant  were  expounding  some  dark  metaphysical  mystery.  He 
is  attempting  to  give  a  clear  analysis  of  our  ordinary  experience 
in  such  an  act  as  the  recognition  that  this  is  a  red  house  or 
that  this  house  is  red.3  What  we  see  initially  is  a  coloured 
surface,  and  if  we  are  to  know  that  we  have  before  us  a  house 
with  certain  characteristics,  we  must  supplement  what  we  see 
at  any  moment  by  an  imaginative  construction.  This  imaginative 
construction  may  depend  upon  previous  intuitions  of  this  house 
or  of  other  houses;  it  may  depend  on  our  walking  round  or 
through  the  house  and  observing  its  different  parts.4  We  are 

aA5i=B75.I  suggested  in  Chapter  IV  §  2  that  intuitions  without 
concepts  are  blind,  because  without  thought,  although  we  might, 
for  example,  see  a  colour,  we  could  not  know  that  it  was  the  colour 
of  a  chair,  or  indeed  of  anything:  intuition  apart  from  concepts  can 
give  us  only  a  momentary  appearance,  not  knowledge  of  an  object. 
Imagination  is  also  blind  apart  from  concepts,  since  it  can  give  us 
only  a  picture  or  an  image,  and  not  knowledge  of  an  object.  The 
parallel  between  intuition  and  imagination  is  in  this  respect  exact. 
It  is  only  because  intuition  and  conception  are  combined  that  we 
can  have  knowledge;  and  it  is  only  because  we  bring  the  synthesis 
of  imagination  to  concepts  that  we  can  have  knowledge.  Imagination 
may,  however,  be  blind  in  the  further  sense  that  it  works  according 
to  rules  of  which  it  is  unconscious,  and  these  rules  can  be  known 
only  by  reflective  judgement.  Compare  A  88  =  B  121  and  A  10  n. 

2  We  have  immediate  awareness  of  the  picture  or  image  made,  but 
not  reflective  awareness  of  our  act  of  making  it. 

3  We  might  equally  take  such  a  judgement  as  'This  is  a  house'. 
I  choose  the  above  example  because  it  is  simple,  and  yet  brings  out 
the  element  of  sense  necessary  for  the  judgement.  The  passage  in 
Prol.  §   19  (IV  299  n.)  suggests  that  a  judgement  concerned  with 
primary  qualities  (such  as  'This  house  is  square')  would  be  more 
satisfactory,  but  it  is  difficult  to  believe  that  the  distinction  there 
made  by  Kant  between  'judgements  of  perception*  and  judgements 
of  experience*  is  altogether  happy. 

4  This  second  case  is  the  one  which  Kant  seems  to  have  primarily 
in  view.  It  obviously  involves  memory,  and  therefore  presumably 


XIII  §  5]          CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  271 

scarcely  ever  conscious  of  the  imaginative  act ;  and  except  when 
we  go  on  to  observe  other  parts  of  the  house,  we  may  be 
only  vaguely  conscious  of  the  images  or  intuitions  added  to 
it  by  what  we  see ;  but  such  an  imaginative  act  is  always  present, 
and  must  always  be  present,  in  recognising  any  complex  object 
such  as  a  house.  The  blind  synthesis  of  imagination  is  the 
first  condition  of  knowledge. 

It  is  not,  however,  the  only  condition.  Imagination  by  itself 
could  give  us  only  a  picture  or  image,  and  perhaps  not  even 
that.  If  we  are  to  know  this  house  and  its  colour,  we  must 
*  bring  the  synthesis  to  concepts'.1 

§  5.  Synthesis  and  the  Concept 

The  primary  meaning  of  this  last  statement  might  seem 
to  be  that  we  must  perform  on  the  conceptual  level  what  is 
performed  on  the  imaginative  level.  We  must  not  only  combine 
our  individual  intuitions  of  house  and  red  ;2  we  must  also  com- 
bine our  corresponding  concepts  in  the  judgement  that  this 
house  is  red.  This  is  the  work  of  understanding,  and  it  is  the 
condition  of  knowing  a  real  object. 

So  far  Kant's  doctrine  is  comparatively  simple,  but  in  the 
light  of  what  follows  we  must  add  certain  complications  which 
will  be  considered  more  fully  later  and  have  at  present  to  be 
taken  more  or  less  on  trust.  The  judgement  is  not  merely 
a  recognition  that  we  have  combined  certain  intuitions  in  an 
imaginative  synthesis :  it  asserts  that  certain  features  are  com- 
bined in  the  real  world.3  Furthermore,  although  the  synthesis 
of  imagination  is  controlled  by  what  is  given  in  sensation, 

reproduction  in  imagination.  Even  in  this  case  imagination  probably 
adds  a  good  deal  to  the  sum  of  what  we  have  observed,  but  Kant's 
argument  would  hold,  if  we  merely  combined  our  successive  intuitions 
into  one  complex  intuition  of  this  house. 

1  Incidentally  this  could  happen  only  by  a  miracle,  if  the  imaginative 
synthesis  were  wholly  unconscious. 

2  Our  intuition  of  this  house  is  a  complex  intuition  of  which  the 
intuition  of  red  is  a  part. 

8  This  cannot  be  the  work  of  mere  imagination  or  sense-perception. 
Compare  B  142, 


272  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIII  §  5 

(as  for  example  when  we  look  at  the  house  from  every  side), 
the  principle  at  work  in  the  synthesis  is  the  empirical  concept 
of  'house'.  The  successively  given  intuitions — even  if  we  ignore 
those  that  imagination  adds  by  way  of  supplement — are  all 
combined  in  accordance  with  a  single  plan;  and  this  plan  is 
what  is  thought  generally  in  the  concept  of  'house*.  In  judging 
that  this  is  a  house,  or  that  this  house  is  red,  we  are  conceiving 
the  genergj  plan  or  rule  which  is  manifested  in  the  synthesis 
of  imagination,  and  only  so  can  the  intuitions  synthetised  form 
for  us  one  object  of  knowledge.1 

A  complex  concept  is  for  Kant  more  than  a  collection  of 
common  marks  found  to  be  present  in  different  objects:  it 
involves  some  knowledge  of  the  way  in  which  these  marks 
are  combined.  To  take  a  still  simpler  example,  the  concept 
of  a  triangle  is  not  a  concept  of  three  straight  lines,  but  of 
three  straight  lines  combined  in  such  a  way  as  to  form  the 
sides  of  a  plane  figure.  If  we  are  to  know  that  this  is  a  triangle, 
we  must  recognise  that  in  following  the  boundaries  of  the  figure 
given  to  perception  we  have  combined  three  straight  lines  in 
accordance  with  the  concept.  The  concept  of  triangle  may  be 
said  to  involve — it  might  even  by  Kant  be  said  to  be — the 
concept  of  a  synthesis  of  three  straight  lines.  Hence  in  recog- 
nising that  this  is  a  triangle  we  may  be  said  to  bring  the  synthesis 
to  concepts,  that  is,  to  bring  into  consciousness,  and  so  make 
clear,  the  concept  of  the  synthesis  itself.  Similarly  in  the  more 
complicated  case  of  recognising  that  this  is  a  house  we  are 
making  clear  the  concept  of  the  synthesis  whereby  we  combined 
the  given  manifold  into  one  complex  intuition. 

For  Kant  the  concept  of  any  object  is  (or  involves)  the 
concept  of  the  imaginative  synthesis  by  which  we  combine 
the  given  manifold  into  one  complex  intuition.  More  precisely 


1  It  may  be  suggested  that  the  imaginative  synthesis  is  dominated 
by  the  concept  'red  house*  rather  then  'house1.  This  is  no  doubt 
true  where  we  judge  that  this  house  is  red  (or  that  this  is  a  red  house), 
but  the  concept  of  'house*  is  of  fundamental  importance ;  and  we  must 
concentrate  on  the  simplest  and  most  fundamental  factors  in  the 
situation,  if  we  are  to  understand  Kant's  doctrine. 


XIII  §  5]          CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  273 

(since  the  concept  is  not  the  idea  of  an  individual1)  the  concept 
of  the  characteristics  common  to  different  individual  objects  is 
(or  involves)  a  concept  of  the  rule  of  the  imaginative  synthesis 
which  is  necessary  to  combine  the  given  manifold  into  one 
complex  intuition  of  an  object  possessing  these  common 
characteristics.2  Hence  when  we  know  the  synthetised  manifold 
by  means  of  a  concept,  we  are  in  some  degree  making  explicit 
the  rule  which  is  manifested  in  the  synthesis  of  imagination : 
in  Kant's  language  we  are  'bringing  the  synthesis  to  concepts'. 
All  this  may  sound  very  complicated,  but  it  is  comparatively 
simple  once  we  see  what  Kant  is  talking  about.  His  statement 
should  be  taken  on  an  empirical  level,  and  is  not  intended  to 
raise  any  questions  as  to  idealism  and  realism.  As  I  understand 
him,  he  is  assuming  that  we  possess  empirical  concepts  and 
have  knowledge  of  empirical  objects.  He  is  not  asking  either 
how  we  come  to  have  empirical  concepts  or  how  we  can  begin 
with  nothing  but  empirical  intuitions  and  pass  to  knowledge 
of  an  object.  All  he  asks  is  what  we  are  doing  when  we  are 
knowing  empirical  objects.3  His  answer  is  that  we  are  combining 

1  As  I  pointed  out  in  Chapter  IX  §  4,  although  we  use  singular 
terms  in  speaking   of  concepts    (e.g.  the   concept  of  'house'),  this 
should  not  blind  us  to  the  fact  that  the  content  of  a  concept  is  not  an 
individual  object. 

2  Compare  A  141  —  B  180.  'The  concept  of  ''dog"  signifies  a  rule 
according  to  which  my  imagination  can  delineate  generally  the  shape 
of  a  certain  four-footed  animal  without  being  limited  either  to  some 
special  individual  shape  offered  by  experience  or  to  any  possible 
individual  image  which    I  construct  in  concrete.'  This  doctrine  is 
elaborated   further   in    the   Transcendental    Deduction    and   in    the 
Schematism  of  the  Categories. 

3  I  believe — in  spite  of  his  use  of  temporal  phrases  like  'at  first* 
— that  he  is  analysing  our  knowledge  into  contemporaneous  and  not 
successive  processes.  The  general  doctrine,  however,  remains  the 
same,  if  we  take  him  to  be  describing  a  process  whereby  we  first 
of  all  synthetise  the  given  manifold  into  a  complex  intuition  of  we 
know  not  what,  and  finally  decide  that  what  we  have  before  us  is 
a  house.  This  is  a  much  rarer  process,  but  even  in  such  a  case  the 
vague  concept  of  'thing*  or  'object'  is  present  all  along.  This  inciden- 
tally involves  the  presence  of  the  categories,  but  for  the  moment  we 
need  not  consider  their  presence.  The  fundamental  error  of  interpreta- 
tion is  to  suppose  that  Kant  is  describing  a  process  whereby  we  first 
of  all  have  before  us  a  mere  intuition  recognised  to  be  purely  subjective, 


274  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIII  §  6 

or  synthetising  the  given  manifold  into  one  complex  intuition 
in  accordance  with  an  empirical  concept,  and  we  are  making 
this  empirical  concept  explicit  in  such  a  judgement  as  'This 
is  a  house*.  We  cannot  have,  in  the  strict  sense,  knowledge 
of  an  object,  unless  there  is  present  both  a  synthesis  of  the 
imagination  and  a  judgement  of  the  understanding. 

It  should  be  unnecessary  to  add  that  he  is  offering  us  a 
reflective  analysis  of  an  unreflective  act.  He  does  not  mean 
that  in  knowing  an  object  we  are  reflectively  aware  of  our 
act  of  synthesis,  and  still  less  that  we  recognise  our  empirical 
concept  to  be  a  concept  of  the  rule  manifested  in  the  act  of 
synthesis.  Nevertheless  if  we  examine  what  is  involved  in  our 
knowledge  of  any  concrete  object  such  as  a  house,  we  shall 
find  that  his  analysis  is  correct.1 

§  6.  Pure  Synthesis  and  the  Category 

Having  described  synthesis  in  general,  Kant  returns  to  the 
pure  synthesis.  This  pure  synthesis  he  has  already  connected 
with  the  categories  by  asserting  (i)  that  the  categories  receive 
their  'stuff'  or  content  from  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and 
space,  and  (2)  that  the  spontaneity  of  thought  demands  a 
synthesis  of  this  pure  manifold.2  He  now  informs  us  that  'the 
pure  synthesis •,  when  it  is  universally  represented,  gives  us  the 
pure  concept  of  the  understanding.'*  This  can  mean  only  that 
the  category  is  a  concept  of  'the  pure  synthesis'. 

We  have  seen  that  for  Kant  the  concept  of  'house'  is  a  concept 
of  the  empirical  synthesis  of  imagination4  whereby  the  given 

and  then  by  a  further  act  of  judgement  recognise  that  it  is  the  subjec- 
tive intuition  of  an  objective  house.  There  is  no  such  temporal  transi- 
tion from  the  subjective  to  the  objective,  and  Kant  is  not  describing

4  Here,  as  always,  we  must  understand  this  to  mean,  not  that  it 
is  an  idea  of  the  actual  synthesis  which  takes  place,  but  that  it  is  a 
concept  of  the  common  character  which  this  synthesis  shares  with 
others,  and  so  a  concept  of  the  rule  or  plan  manifested  in  this  synthesis 
and  in  other  syntheses.

manifold  is  combined  into  one  complex  intuition  of  a  house. 
Hence  it  is  not  surprising  to  find  that  the  category  is — I  should 
prefer  to  say  'involves'  or  'includes' — a  concept  of  the  pure 
synthesis.  The  difficulty  is  to  know  what  Kant  means  by  the 
'pure  synthesis'. 

I  will  put  my  view  dogmatically:  its  justification  must  be 
found  in  the  subsequent  analysis  of  Kant's  argument.  The 
pure  synthesis  in  question  is  the  synthesis  which  combines 
the  pure  manifold  of  time  and  space  j1  and  this  pure  synthesis 
imposes  upon  all  sensible  objects  certain  necessary  and  uni- 
versal categorial  characteristics.  To  take  an  obvious  example:  in 
knowing  a  house  I  am  not  only  synthetising  empirical  intuitions ; 
I  am  also  synthetising  the  pure  manifold  of  the  space  which  it 
occupies  and  the  time  through  which  it  lasts.  This  pure  synthesis 
necessarily  imposes  upon  the  object  the  categorial  characteristic 
of  being  an  extensive  quantity,  since  time  and  space  are  extensive 
quantities  ;2  and  it  is  present  whenever  wre  know  any  sensible 
object.3 

Kant  would  seem  to  be  concerned  here  with  the  category 
as  containing  a  'stuff'  given  through  the  synthesis  of  the  pure 
manifold,  and  therefore  with  the  category  as  schematised. 
Nevertheless  even  the  pure  category  might  be  said,  on  Kant's 
view,  to  be  in  a  sense  a  concept  of  the  pure  synthesis.  The 
schematised  category  of  extensive  quantity,  for  example,  is  a 
concept  of  the  synthesis  of  the  homogeneous  manifold  of  space 
and  time  :4  the  pure  category  is  a  concept  of  the  synthesis  of  the 

1  We  shall  have  later  to  face  certain  difficulties  as  to  the  relation 
between  this  pure  synthesis  and  the  empirical  synthesis  of  the  given 
manifold,  but  it  would  be  unprofitable  to  raise  these  difficulties  here. 

2  Kant   believes   that  the   same   synthesis   also   imposes   intensive 
quantity,  and  that  it  makes  the  object  appear  to  us  as  a  permanent 
substance  with  changing  qualities  which  interacts  with  other  similar 
substances. 

8  Kant  is  thinking  primarily  of  physical  objects  in  space,  though 
his  doctrine  ought  to  apply  to  objects  of  inner  sense  given  under  the 
form  of  time.  I  have  chosen  the  example  of  extensive  quantity  because 
it  offers  little  difficulty.  The  difficulties  involved  as  regards  other 
categories  must  for  the  present  be  postponed.

homogeneous,  which  is  thought  in  the  form  of  the  judgement 
'All  S  is  P' — for  all  the  S's  are  thought  of  as  homogeneous. 
Hence  the  pure  category  may  be  said  to  be  a  concept  of  the 
synthesis  of  the  homogeneous  manifold  of  space  and  time  in 
the  same  sense  as  the  concept  of  the  genus  is  a  concept  of  any 
species  falling  under  the  genus.1 

The  spontaneity  of  thought  demands  that  the  pure  manifold 
should  be  synthetised  in  a  certain  way\  the  principles  or  rules 
at  work  in  the  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  must  accord 
with  the  necessary  forms  of  thought,  and  so  with  the  pure 
categories.  This  may  be  the  reason  why  Kant,  who  has  said 
that  a  synthesis  is  pure  when  the  manifold  synthetised  is  given 
a  priori  (as  is  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and  space),2  now 
describes  pure  synthesis  as  one  which  'rests  on  a  ground  of 
synthetic  a  priori  unity'.3 

I  do  not  think  there  is  any  conflict  between  these  two  state- 
ments. When  we  synthetise  an  empirical  manifold,  as  for 
example  in  the  act  of  knowing  an  individual  house,  the  synthesis 
appears  to  be  controlled — and  for  the  moment  we  may  accept 
this  view — by  the  nature  of  intuitions  which  are  given  empiri- 
cally. When  we  synthetise  the  pure  homogeneous  manifold  of 
time  and  space,  the  synthesis  is  controlled  by  the  nature  of 
our  concept.  This  can  be  seen  in  the  procedure  of  mathematics.4 
We  construct  a  triangle  or  a  circle  in  pure  intuition  according 
to  the  nature  of  our  concept,  not  according  to  the  nature  of 

1  Compare  A  142-3  =  B  182,  B  162,  B  202  ff.,  and  A  242  =  B  300. 
Similarly  if  we  abstract  from  the  temporal  element  involved  in  the 
synthesis  of  cause  and  effect,  we  are  left  with  the  pure  category  of 
ground  and  consequent,  which  is  thought  in  the  hypothetical  form 
of  judgement;  see  B  162-3.  Even  if  we  cannot  accept  this  theory, 
we  must  try  to  understand  it.  For  further  details,  see  Chapter  XXXIII. 

2  See  A  77  =  B  103.  8  A  78  =  B  104. 
4  It  is  confusing  when  Kant,  immediately  after  defining  the  pure 

concepts  of  the  understanding  as  concepts  of  the  pure  synthesis, 
proceeds  to  discuss  the  pure  synthesis  in  relation  to  mathematical 
concepts.  I  find  it  difficult  to  believe  that  'pure  concepts  of  the  under- 
standing' can  here  cover  mathematical  concepts;  they  ought  to  be 
the  categories  and  the  categories  alone.  A  mathematical  concept  is  a 
pure  concept  inasmuch  as  it  is  a  concept  of  a  pure  synthesis,  but  it 
is  not  a  pure  concept  of  the  understanding. 


XIII  §  6]         CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  277 

what  happens  to  be  given  to  us  in  empirical  intuition.1  This 
is  an  arbitrary  act  upon  our  part,  and  for  this  reason  mathe- 
matical concepts  are  said  to  be  arbitrary.2  The  categories  are 
not  arbitrary,  for  they  are  implicit  in  the  nature  of  thought 
as  such;  but  it  is  necessary  for  the  human  mind  to  combine 
the  pure  manifold  in  accordance  with  the  categories,  just  as 
the  mathematician  combines — though  only  by  an  arbitrary 
act3 — the  pure  manifold  in  accordance  with  mathematical 
concepts. 

It  is  clear  that  the  mathematical  concept  of  triangle  is  the 
source  or  ground  of  the  unity4  of  the  pure  synthesis  whereby 
we  construct  a  triangle  in  pure  intuition;  and  Kant  believes 
that  similarly  the  categories  are  the  sources  or  grounds  of  the 
unity  of  the  pure  synthesis  which  is  necessarily  present  in 
knowing  any  empirical  object.5 


1  Kant's  own  example  is  the  more  complicated  one  of  counting. 
He  points  out  that  counting  is  a  synthesis  in  accordance  with  concepts, 
and  this  is  most  obvious  in  larger  numbers  where  we  employ  the 
conceptof  the  decad.  Prichard's  objection  (Kant's  Theory  of  Knowledge, 
p.  164  n.)  that  we  do  not  use  this  concept  in  counting  numbers  less 
than  ten  seems  to  me  irrelevant.  For  further  details  of  Kant's  view 
on  this  point,  see  K.d.U.  §§  26  and  27  (V  251-60). 

8  Compare  Chapter  IX  §  5. 

3  Nevertheless  this  arbitrary  act  must  itself  conform  to  the  nature 
of  space  and  time  and  to  the  categories. 

4  It  is  a  ground  of  'synthetic  a  priori  unity',  because  the  unity  is 
the  unity  of  a  synthesis  and  is  independent  of  experience.  This  unity 
is  said  to  be  necessary,  and  it  should  be  noted  that  in  this  passage, 
which  is  alleged  to  be  late,  Kant  makes  a  particular  concept,  and  not 
a  category,  the  ground  of  necessity — the  very  doctrine  whose  presence 
is  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  maintaining  that  a  subsequent  passage 
(A  105-6)  must  be  early. 

*  Compare  A  79  =  B  104.  The  ultimate  source  of  the  unity  of  the 
pure  synthesis  is  the  unity  of  apperception,  the  *I  think'  which  must 
accompany  all  our  ideas;  but  since  thought,  according  to  Kant,  is 
necessarily  manifested  in  a  definite  number  of  principles  of  synthesis 
(the  forms  of  judgement),  each  pure  category  may  be  said  to  be  the 
ground  of  a  special  unity  in  the  pure  synthesis.  The  difficulties  of 
this  doctrine  should  not  detain  us  at  the  present  stage. 


278  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION         [XIII  §  7 

§  7.  The  Conditions  of  a  priori  Knowledge 

This  last  point  is  brought  out  by  Kant  in  the  paragraph1 
which  precedes  his  difficult  and  summary  statement  of  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction ;  but  it  is  prefaced  by  a  further  contrast 
between  Formal  and  Transcendental  Logic. 

Formal  Logic,  in  treating  of  the  form  (or  universality)  of 
concepts,  describes  the  analytic  procedure  which  is  present  in 
making — and,  I  believe,  in  thinking — any  and  every  concept 
as  such;  that  is,  it  describes  the  procedure  of  bringing  different 
intuitions  (or  objects)  under  a  concept2  by  analysis  and  by 
the  abstraction  of  common  characteristics.  With  this  analytic 
procedure  Transcendental  Logic  has  no  concern:  its  business 
is  to  show  how  the  pure  synthesis  (involved  in  knowing  any 
and  every  object)  is  'brought  to  concepts'.  Transcendental 
Logic,  in  short,  will  show  us  that  the  categories  are  the  principles 
at  work  in  the  pure  synthesis  which  is  a  necessary  element  in 
all  knowledge  of  objects;3  and  consequently  that  by  means 
of  the  categories  we  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  any  and  every 
object  as  such. 

For  a  priori  knowledge  of  all  objects4  three  things  are 
necessary:  firstly  a  manifold  of  pure  intuition;  secondly  a 
synthesis  of  this  pure  manifold  by  imagination;  and  thirdly 
the  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding.  In  this  doctrine  Kant 
never  varies,  and  we  shall  find  it  elaborated  in  the  Transcenden- 
tal Deduction. 

1 A  78-9  =  B  104. 

2  Compare  also  the  definition  of  function*  (upon  which  all  concepts 
are  said  to  be  grounded)  in  A  68  =  B  93. 

8  The  categories  are  employed  in  all  'experience*  from  the  very 
start,  and  they  had  been  made  explicit  or  'clear*  by  reflective  thinking 
long  before  the  time  of  Kant.  The  business  of  Transcendental  Logic  is 
to  justify  them  by  showing  that  they  are  the  principles  governing 
the  pure  synthesis  involved  in  all  knowledge. 

4  Note  that  Kant  is  concerned  with  a  priori  knowledge  of  all  objects 
— mathematical  concepts  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  only  of  certain 
special  kinds  of  objects  (triangles,  circles,  and  so  on) ;  and  indeed 
mathematical  objects  are  not  objects  in  the  full  sense  (for  objects 
proper  must  be  capable  of  being  given  to  sense),  but  are  rather  the 
form  of  objects  (see  B  147). 


XIII  §  7]         CONCEPTION  AND  SYNTHESIS  279 

In  view  of  the  previous  discussion  it  is  hardly  necessary  to 
add  (i)  that  the  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  does  not — any 
more  than  the  synthesis  of  an  empirical  manifold1 — give  us 
by  itself  knowledge  in  the  strict  sense ;  (2)  that  the  pure  concept 
of  the  understanding  gives  unity  to  the  pure  synthesis  ;2  (3)  that 
it  consists  solely  in  the  thought  of  this  necessary  unity.  The 
last  statement  may  indeed  appear  to  be  novel;  but  for  Kant 
there  would  seem  to  be  no  difference  between  saying  that  the 
category  is  a  concept  of  the  pure  synthesis3  (or  of  the  rule  of 
the  pure  synthesis)  and  saying  that  the  category  is  a  concept 
of  the  unity  of  the  pure  synthesis. 

The  further  point  to  be  made  is  that  the  categories  'rest' 
or  are  grounded  upon  the  understanding,  as  is  already  indicated 
by  calling  them  'pure  concepts  of  the  understanding'.  No  doubt 
all  concepts  may  be  said  to  rest  upon  the  understanding  inas- 
much as  they  rest  upon  the  'function'  of  judging.4  The  cate- 
gories, however,  do  so  in  a  very  special  and  more  immediate 
sense;  for,  as  Kant  believes,  the  rules  of  pure  synthesis  which 
constitute  their  content  are  imposed  neither  by  the  nature  of 
given  sensations  nor  by  an  arbitrary  act  of  the  mind,  but  by 
the  essential  nature  of  judgement  itself. 

This  contention  is  the  crux  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction, 
and  the  whole  of  the  previous  argument  has  been  leading  up 
to  it.  It  is  expounded  by  Kant  in  one  concentrated  and  difficult 
paragraph,5  which  will  be  examined  in  the  following  chapter. 

1  Compare  A  78  =  B  103  and  §  4  above. 

2  Just  as  the  mathematical  concept  gives  unity  to  the  imaginative 
synthesis  in  a  mathematical  construction.  We  need  not  yet  raise  the 
question  whether  the  empirical  concept  gives  unity  to  the  empirical 
synthesis  of  apprehension  or  is  present  only  when  we  recognise 
this  unity. 

8  This  we  have  already  learned  (see  §  6  above). 

4  See  A  68  =  B  93.  All  conception  involves  at  least  a  problematic 
judgement  whereby  we  bring  different  individual  objects  under  a 
common  mark.  5  A  79  =  B  104-5. 


CHAPTER    XIV 
THE  METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION 

§  i.  The  General  Nature  of  the  Argument 

The  sentences  in  which  Kant  sums  up  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction  are  too  concentrated  to  be  clear,  and  the  exact 
interpretation  of  the  language  employed  may  reasonably  be 
subject  to  dispute.  It  would  be  tedious  to  consider  all  the 
possible  interpretations  of  each  separate  phrase,  and  I  propo^fe 
to  state  only  what  seems  to  me  the  most  probable  meaning.1 
Nevertheless  I  believe  one  thing  to  be  beyond  all  reasonable 
doubt — that  Kant  is  contrasting  the  two  views  of  judgement 
which  have  been  examined  in  the  two  preceding  chapters,  the 
views  proper  to  Formal  and  to  Transcendental  Logic.2  On 
the  one  hand  we  have  learned  that  all  judgement,  and  indeed 
all  conceiving,  involves  an  analytic  procedure  whereby  different 
individual  objects  are  thought  by  means  of  a  common  mark 
and  are  united  under  that  common  mark.  On  the  other  hand, 
we  have  learned  that  all  judgement,  and  indeed  all  conceiving, 
so  far  as  it  gives  us  knowledge  of  real  individual  objects,  involves 
imaginative  synthesis  of  a  given  manifold,  both  empirical  and 
pure,  and  so  involves  the  unification  of  the  manifold  into  an 
intuition  of  an  individual  object.  These  two  doctrines — both 
of  which  Kant  believes  to  be  true — are  brought  together  in 
the  final  argument  and  are  supposed  to  yield  the  conclusion 
of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction. 

The  final  argument  ought  to  show  that  the  categories  issue 
from  the  nature  of  the  understanding  itself  and  constitute  a 
complete3  system  corresponding  to  the  system  of  the  necessary 

1  As  this  is  a  matter  of  very  great  importance,  I  wish  to  say — in 
addition  to  my  general  acknowledgment  in  the  Preface — that  in  the 
present  discussion  I  have  profited  very  much  by  suggestions  both 
from  Mr.  Barker  and  Mr.  Cousin,  though  they  are  in  no  way  re- 
sponsible for  my  view. 

2  The  first  view  is  given  in  A  67  =  B  92  ff.,  and  the  second  in 
A  76  =  B  102  ff.  8  A  67  =   B  92. 


XIV  §2]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  281 

forms  of  judgement.1  In  view  of  what  Kant  has  said,2  we  might 
expect  the  final  argument  to  show  also  how  the  categories  can 
receive  a  'stuff'  from  the  pure  manifold  of  space  and  time, 
and  can  consequently  apply  a  priori  to  all  objects  of  experi- 
ence given  under  the  forms  of  space  and  time. 

With  this  general  plan  of  the  argument  in  view  we  should 
be  in  a  better  position  to  interpret  the  details  of  Kant's 
statement. 

§  2.  Unity  in  Judgement 

'The  same  function  which  gives  unity  to  the  different  ideas 
in  a  judgement  also  gives  unity  to  the  mere  synthesis  of  different 
ideas  in  an  intuition'3 

The  'function'  with  which  Kant  is  here  concerned  must 
be  the  work  proper  to  understanding,  namely  thinking  or 
judging.  It  must,  in  fact,  be  'the  function  of  thinking',  which, 
when  we  attend  only  to  its  form,  'can  be  brought  under  four 
heads,  each  of  which  contains  three  moments'.4  This  general 
function  of  thinking,  which  according  to  Kant  manifests 
itself  necessarily  in  the  twelve  forms  of  judgement,  is  now 
alleged  to  do  two  things;  of  these  the  first  is  to  'give  unity 
to  the  different  ideas  in  a  judgement'. 

I  take  this  to  be  the  doctrine  which  Kant  has  already  ex- 
pressed, not  altogether  happily,  in  saying  that  all  judgements 
are  functions  of  unity  (that  is,  of  unification)  in  our  ideas.5 
Every  judgement  is  supposed  by  Kant  to  unite  different  ideas  :6 
the  categorical  judgement  unites  (or  relates)  the  subject- 
concept  and  the  predicate-concept,  while  hypothetical  and 
disjunctive  judgements  unite  (or  relate)  different  judgements 

1  B  159. 

2  Compare  the  statement  in  A  76-7  —  B  102,  and  also  the  assertion 
that  categories  are  concepts  of  the  'pure   synthesis*  and   that   the 
synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  pure  intuition  is  necessary  for  a  priori 
knowledge  of  all  objects  (A  78-9  =  B  104). 

3  A  79  =  B  104-5.  *  A  70  =  B  95. 
5  A  69  =  B  94.  For  criticism  of  this  phrase,  see  Chapter  XII  §  2; 

for  the  general  sense  in  which  judgement  unifies  ideas,  see  Chapter 
XII  §  5.  6  Compare  Log.  §  17  (IX  101). 


382  THE  METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  2 

(which,  I  presume,  are  themselves  categorical).1  Nevertheless 
in  the  present  passage,  as  in  the  previous  one,2  I  believe  that 
Kant's  main  concern  is  not  with  the  unification  of  concepts 
or  judgements,  but  with  a  more  elementary  and  fundamental 
aspect  of  thought.  In  all  judging  or  conceiving  we  unite  dif- 
ferent intuitions  (that  is,  intuitions  of  different  objects)  under 
a  concept;  or,  more  simply,  we  hold  many  individual  objects 
before  our  minds  by  means  of  a  common  mark  (or  marks).3 
The  different  ideas  united  in  the  judgement  are  the  individual 
objects4  referred  to  by  the  judgement;  and  they  are  united 
in  the  sense  that  they  are  thought  together  in  virtue  of  their 
common  characteristics. 

This  is,  I  think,  sufficient  for  our  present  purposes,  and 
the  various  complications  and  difficulties  involved  cannot  be 
considered  here.  To  judge  is  essentially  to  think  together 
a  plurality  of  individuals  by  means  of  concepts,  and  it  is  quite 
untrue  to  say  that  this  doctrine  holds  only  of  universal  judge- 
ments.5 The  simplest  case  to  consider  is  that  in  which  we 
unite  a  plurality  of  individuals  under  one  concept  as  in  the 
judgement  'This  is  a  house'  or  'There  are  houses'.6  Neverthe- 

1  See  A  73  =  B  98  and  B  140-1.  If  we  desire  a  general  formula 
to  cover  all  cases,  we  can  say  that  every  judgement  brings  given 
cognitions  to  the  objective  unity  of  apperception.  We  should  also 
remember  that  the  form  of  a  judgement  consists  in  'the  determination 
of  the  way  in  which  the  different  ideas,  as  such,  belong  to'  (or  are 
united  in)  'one  consciousness';  see  Log.  §  18  (IX  101). 

2  See  A  69  =  B  94  and  compare  Chapter  XII  §  5. 

8  The  example  previously  given  was  the  holding  of  bodies  before 
the  mind  by  the  common  mark  of  divisibility ;  see  A  69  =  B  93-4. 

4  Every  individual  object  is,  for  Kant,  given  in  intuition  (or  capable 
of  being  given  in  intuition),  and  is  itself  a  complex  intuition  bound 
together  by  necessity.  Kant's  use  of  the  word  'intuition'  or  'idea' 
for  the  object  of  a  true  judgement  is  apt  to  produce  misunderstanding, 
yet  it  serves  to  bring  out  the  fact  that  his  philosophy  is  not  repre- 
sentative idealism  but  empirical  realism. 

6 1  have  already  pointed  out,  in  Chapter  XII  §  5,  that  to  conceive 
a  universal  is  to  think  a  mark  which  belongs,  at  least  potentially,  to 
a  plurality  of  individuals,  even  if  we  apply  it  in  a  singular  judgement. 

6  We  need  not  consider  whether  other  concepts  are  involved  even 
here.  I  choose  the  singular  judgement  as  one  of  my  examples 
deliberately — this  house  is  united  with  other  houses  in  a  class. 


XIV  §  3]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  283 

less  we  should  note  that  in  judgement  we  do  more  than  unite 
in  a  class  the  different  instances  to  which  our  concepts,  taken 
separately,  refer:  we  also  unite  (or  separate)  the  classes  them- 
selves according  to  the  way  in  which  we  unite  (or  separate)  the 
concepts.  Hence  the  whole  judgement — and  not  merely  the 
separate  concepts  of  which  it  is  composed — may  be  said  to 
unite  the  individuals  to  which  it  refers,  and  in  the  different 
forms  of  judgement  the  individuals  referred  to  are  united 
in  different  ways.1 

It  should  also  be  remembered  that  the  procedure  of  bringing 
different  ideas  (or  objects)  under  a  concept  has  been  described 
as  analytic.2  To  bring  different  ideas  (or  objects)  under  a 
concept  is  presumably  to  unite  them  under  that  concept; 
and  if  so,  the  procedure  of  uniting  ideas  (or  objects)  under 
a  concept  must  also  be  described  as  analytic.  This  analytic 
aspect  is  present  in  every  judgement  and  in  every  form  of 
judgement. 

§3.  Unity  and  Synthesis 

The  second  task  performed  by  the  function  of  thinking 
is  to  give  unity  to  the  'mere  synthesis'  3  of  different  ideas4 
in  an  intuition.  Here  Kant  is  manifestly  concerned  with  the 
synthesis  of  the  given  manifold  into  one  complex  intuition 
of  an  individual  object.5  The  'mere  synthesis'  we  may  take 
to  be  the  synthesis  which  is  the  'mere  working'  of  imagination,6 

1  Kant,  in  dealing  with  the  different  forms  of  judgement,  commonly 
deals  with  'Umfang*  or  lSphdre\  that  is,  with  the  denotation  of  the 
terms  in  the  judgement.  I  do  not  wish  to  stress  this  unduly,  but  it  is 
important  as  showing  that  differences  in  the  forms  of  judgement  are 
not  irrelevant  to  the  different  ways  in  which  the  objects  referred  to 
by  the  judgement  are  united.  Compare  A  71  =  B  96  ff.  and  Log. 
§§  21-29  (IX  102-7).  2  A  78  =  B  104. 

3  'der  blossen  Synthesis.' 

4 'Ideas'  here  are  equivalent  to  Impressions'  or  'sensa',  whereas 
before  they  were  equivalent  to  Objects'. 

8  For  Kant  the  complex  intuition  and  the  object  may  in  some 
ways  be  regarded  as  identical.

and  which  does  not  of  itself  give  us  knowledge.1  Understanding 
gives  unity  to  the  synthesis  of  imagination,  and  so  gives  unity 
indirectly  to  the  manifold  synthetised. 

The  difficulties  begin  to  arise  when  we  ask  ourselves  what 
is  the  nature  of  the  manifold  synthetised.  Kant  may  be  speaking 
about  synthesis  in  general,2  and  this  would  be  equivalent 
to  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general?  that  is, 
of  any  and  every  intuition  whether  empirical  or  pure.  Or  he 
may  be  speaking  about  the  'mere  synthesis'  just  mentioned, 
the  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and  space.  On  the 
whole  I  think  it  more  probable  that  he  is  referring  us  back 
to  the  earlier  passage  which  deals  with  'synthesis  in  general'.4 
He  presumably  expects  us  to  connect  what  has  been  said 
about  'synthesis  in  general'  and  about  'pure  synthesis',  and  to 
recognise  that  the  thinking  which  gives  unity  to  'synthesis 
in  general'  must  a  fortiori  give  unity  to  pure  synthesis  (which 
is  a  particular  species  of  'synthesis  in  general').5 

If  we   set   aside   these   complications,    Kant's   contention 

1  A  78  =  B  103  and  A  79  =  B  104.  'Mere  synthesis'  may  mean 
synthesis  in  abstraction  from  the  thought  without  which  we  have 
no  knowledge  of  an  object.  It  might,  however,  mean  synthesis  in 
abstraction  from  the  given  matter;  and  it  would  then  be  equivalent 
to  synthesis  in  general. 

2  Compare  A  77  =  B  103  and  A  78  =  B  103. 

8  'Intuition  in  general*  is  mentioned  twice  in  A  79  =  B  105 ;  compare 
also  B  144.  It  covers  any  kind  of  sensuous  intuition — any  intuition 
given  to,  or  derived  from,  a  passive  or  receptive  sensibility — whether 
empirical  or  pure.  It  therefore  covers  all  human  intuitions,  both 
pure  intuitions  of  time  and  space  and  also  empirical  intuitions  given 
under  the  forms  of  time  and  space.  Kant  believes  (see,  for  example, 
A  27  =  B  43)  that  other  finite  beings  might  have  different  sensuous 
intuitions  given  under  forms  other  than  time  and  space.  Their  intuitions 
would  also  be  covered  by  the  phrase  'intuition  in  general'.  As  rational 
beings  they  would  use  our  pure  categories,  but  the  *  stuff'  given  to 
these  categories  would  be  different,  and  so  their  schematised  categories 
would  be  different. 

*  The  phrases  used  seem  to  echo  those  in  A  77-8  =  B  103. 

6  He  has  already  explained  that  pure  concepts  give  unity  to  pure 
synthesis  (A  79  =  B  104),  and  that  the  spontaneity  of  thought  demands 
that  the  pure  manifold  be  synthetised  in  a  certain  way  (A  77  =  B  102). 
Compare  Chapter  XIII  §§  6  and  7. 


XIV  §  3]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  285 

is  that  thought  does  more  than  unite  different  objects — by 
methods  of  analysis  and  abstraction — under  concepts  of  their 
common  characteristics;  it  also  imposes  unity  upon  that 
synthesis  of  imagination  whereby  given  intuitions  are  com- 
bined into  individual  objects  whose  common  characteristics 
can  be  conceived. 

We  have  seen  that  if  our  manifold  given  intuitions  are 
to  constitute  one  complex  intuition  of  an  object,  they  must 
be  synthetised,  and  the  synthesis  must  be  brought  to  concepts. 
This  means  that  whatever  concept  or  concepts  may  be 
required  for  knowledge  of  an  object,  judgement  is  always 
required.  The  synthesis  may  vary  with  the  particular 
matter  given  and  the  particular  concepts  employed,  but 
there  is  one  respect  in  which  it  does  not  vary:  judgement 
must  always  be  present ;  for  no  object  can  be  an  object,  unless 
it  is  judged. 

The  doctrine,  so  far,  may  be  accepted,  and  yet  it  may  be 
held  that  judgement  recognises  the  unity  present  in  the  syn- 
thesis of  the  manifold,  but  does  not  give  unity  to  the  synthesis. 
Kant,  however,  holds  that  the  unity  of  the  synthesis  is  not  only 
recognised,  but  is  also  imposed,  by  judgement.  If  we  take 
experience  at  its  face  value,  we  are  compelled  by  the  nature 
of  our  sensations  to  combine  the  given,  now  into  a  house,  and 
now  into  a  ship ;  and  we  recognise  the  unity  of  the  particular 
matter  combined  when  we  apply  the  empirical  concepts 
of  'house*  and  'ship'.1  This  is,  I  believe,  fully  accepted  by 
Kant;  but  he  asks  us  to  probe  a  little  deeper,  and  maintains 
that  there  are  ultimate  principles  governing  such  empirical 
syntheses,  and  that  these  ultimate  principles  are  imposed 
by  the  nature  of  thought  itself.2  We  must,  for  example,  com- 
bine the  given  as  a  substance  with  different  accidents,  and  this 
ultimate  principle  of  unity  is  imposed  by  thought,  and  not 

1  Compare  A  103  ff. 

2  The  objection  that  the  synthesis  must  either  be  wholly  determined 
by  the  given,  or  else  wholly  determined  by  the  mind,  seems  to  me 
quite  false.  It  is  another  example  of  the  error  which  I  criticised  in 
Chapter  VI  §  8. 


a86  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION       [XIV  §  4 

by  the  nature  of  our  given  sensations.1  The  synthesis  of  imagi- 
nation, however  much  it  may  vary  with  the  different  matter 
given,  must  combine  the  manifold  in  accordance  with  the 
principles  of  synthesis  present  in  judgement  as  such.  Thought 
is  the  ultimate  source  of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis  of  our 
intuitions;  and  if  it  did  not  impose  this  unity  upon  the  syn- 
thesis, there  could  not  be  any  object  of  knowledge. 

This  is  the  doctrine  elaborated  in  the  Transcendental 
Deduction.2  It  means  that  every  object  of  knowledge,  besides 
the  particular  structure  which  we  recognise  by  our  empirical 
concepts,  must  have  a  universal  structure  or  form3  which 
is  imposed  by  the  structure — or  form — of  judgement  as  such. 
The  present  passage  offers  no  argument  in  support  of  this 
contention,  but  merely  asserts,  in  the  most  general  way,  that 
thought  gives  unity  to,  or  imposes  unity  upon,  that  synthesis 
of  imagination  (and  ultimately  on  that  pure  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion) without  which  there  can  be  no  knowledge  of  objects. 
We  should  take  this  as  a  hypothesis  to  be  established  later; 
but  it  must  be  provisionally  accepted,  if  we  are  to  follow 
Kant's  attempt  to  connect  the  categories  with  the  forms 
of  judgement. 

§  4.  The  Pure  Concept  of  the  Understanding 

Having  asserted  that  thought  gives  unity  to  the  mere  syn- 
thesis of  different  ideas  in  an  intuition,  Kant  adds  that  this 
unity,  when  'universally  expressed',  is  the  pure  concept  of  the 
understanding.4 

1  In   human   experience    such   imposition   necessarily   involves    a 
synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and  space. 

2  See  especially  A  in,  A  125,  and  B  143. 

3  By  universal  structure  or  form  I  mean  one  which  it  shares  with 
all  objects,  and  not  merely  with  some  objects,  such  as  houses  or  ships. 
If  we  did  not  combine  given  appearances   as  the   accidents  of  a 
permanent  substance,  we  could  never  recognise  a  house  or  a  ship. 
The  differences  between  a  house  and  a  ship  are  given  to  sense;  but 
the  combination  of  substance  and  accident  is  due  to  an  a  priori  act 
of  the  mind. 

4  A  79  =  B  105.  'Universally  expressed*  is  'allgemein  ausgedruckt' ; 
compare  'allgemein  vorgestelW  in  A  79  —  B  104. 


XIV  §  5]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  287 

We  have  seen1  that  Kant  regards  a  concept  of  an  object 
as  a  concept  of  the  synthesis  (or  of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis) 
necessary  to  construct  that  object.  Here  he  regards  the  category, 
which  is  a  concept  of  an  object  in  general,  as  a  concept  of  the 
unity  of  the  synthesis  which  is  necessary  to  construct  any  and 
every  object  of  experience — that  unity  being  imposed  by  the 
nature  of  judgement  as  such.2 

§  5.  Analytic  and  Synthetic  Unity 

We  now  come  to  the  still  more  difficult  sentence  in  which 
Kant  draws  his  conclusion.  I  will  paraphrase  rather  than 
translate. 

The  same  understanding,  and  by  precisely  the  same  acts, 
produces  two  results.  Firstly  in  concepts,  by  means  of  the 
analytic  unity,  it  brought  into  being  the  logical  form  of  a 
judgement.  Secondly,  by  means  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the 
manifold  of  intuition  in  general,  it  introduces  a  transcendental 
content  into  its  ideas.  Hence  we  can  call  these  ideas — presum- 
ably the  ideas  into  which  the  transcendental  content  has  been 
introduced — pure  concepts  of  the  understanding  which  apply 
a  priori  to  objects.  This  is  a  service  which  Formal  Logic 
cannot  perform. 

In  this  difficult  argument  certain  points  seem  to  me  quite 
clear.  Kant  is  carrying  further  his  description  of  the  two 
different  aspects  of  judgement  with  which  the  previous  sen- 
tence— and  indeed  the  whole  Metaphysical  Deduction — is 
concerned.  The  same  understanding  produces  two  different 
results,  not  by  different  acts,  but  by  precisely  the  same  acts;3 

1  See  Chapter  XIII  §  5. 

2  If  the  synthesis  in  question  is  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of 
intuition  in  general,  Kant  is  speaking  of  the  pure  category ;  if,  on  the 
other  hand,  it  is  the  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and  space, 
he  is  speaking  of  the  schematised  category,  as  in  A  78   =   B   104. 
Compare,  however,  Chapter  XIII  §  6. 

3  All  the  acts  of  judgement  produce  the  logical  form  of  a  judgement ; 
some  of  these  acts,  namely  those  which  give  us  knowledge  of  real 
objects,  give  a  transcendental  content  to  the  categories.  For  a  very 
difficult  and  doubtful  development  of  this  theory,  see  Prol.  §   18 
(IV  297-8). 


288  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  6 

and  these  acts  are  acts  of  judgement.  Furthermore  it  produces 
these  different  results  by  means  of  two  different  kinds  of  unity, 
an  analytic  unity  and  a  synthetic  unity.  These  two  unities 
must  be  the  two  unities  referred  to  in  the  previous  sentence. 
The  synthetic  unity  is  manifestly  the  unity  which  thought 
gives  to  the  synthesis  of  different  ideas1  in  an  intuition.  The 
analytic  unity  must  be  the  unity  which  thought  gives  to  dif- 
ferent ideas2  in  a  judgement. 

§  6.  The  Analytic  Unity 

Since  the  acts  of  the  understanding  are  judgements,  the  first 
thing  which  the  understanding  produces3  is  'the  logical  form 
of  a  judgement'.  We  might  suppose  this  to  be  a  clumsy  way 
of  saying  that  understanding  produces  judgements;  but  in 
view  of  the  close  connexion  between  the  categories  and  the 
forms  of  judgement,  we  must  take  Kant  to  mean  exactly  what 
he  says.  In  producing  judgements,  the  understanding  produces 
also  the  form  of  judgement ;  and  this  form  is  studied  in  Formal 
Logic. 

It  is  more  difficult  to  see  why  understanding  should  produce 
the  form  of  judgement  'in  concepts,  by  means  of  the  analytic 
unity'.  Nevertheless  Kant  has  maintained4  that  understanding 
is  a  power  of  thinking,  that  is,  of  knowing  by  means  of  concepts ; 
and  that,  since  concepts  are  essentially  predicates  of  possible 
judgements,  all  conception  is  judgement.  Furthermore  in  all 
conception  we  may  be  said  to  think  what  is  common  to  different 
individual  objects,  and  therefore  to  bring  them  under  a  concept6 
and  so  to  unite  them.  As  this  procedure  is  said  to  be  analytic, 
understanding  in  its  use  of  concepts,  and  indeed  in  the  very 
act  of  conceiving,  may  be  said  to  produce  the  judgement — and 

1  That  is,  sensa  or  impressions.  2  That  is,  objects. 

3  Kant  says  *  produced*  (zustande  brachte).  I  take  the  past  tense 
to  mean  something  like  *  produces,  as  we  saw*.  The  main  reference 
must   be  to  A  70  ==  B  95  considered  in  the  light   of  what  went 
before. 

4  A  69  =  B  94.  The  same  doctrine  is  present  also  in  A  68  =  B  93. 
6  A  78  =  B  104. 


XIV  §  7]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  289 

so  to  produce  the  form  of  judgement — by  means  of  the  analytic 
unity.1 

The  phrase  is  obscure,  and  its  detailed  interpretation  may 
be  uncertain,  but  the  general  lines  of  the  contention  are  clear. 
I  see  no  reason  to  suppose  that  Kant  is  in  any  way  departing 
from  the  doctrine  of  judgement  with  which  we  are  now 
familiar.  Analytic  unity  must  be  present  in  all  judgement  and 
in  all  forms  of  judgement;  for  all  judgement  involves  con- 
ception, and  so  unites  different  objects  in  virtue  of  a  common 
character  which  is  thought  by  an  act  of  analysis  and  abstraction. 

§  7.  The  Synthetic  Unity 

'By  means  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  intuition 
in  general'  understanding  also,  in  judging,  introduces  a  trans- 
cendental content  into  its  ideas. 

The  reference  to  'transcendental  content'  suggests  that  Kant 
is  now  explaining  how  the  pure  categories  can  receive  a  content 
or  'stuff*  from  the  synthesis  of  time  and  space,  and  can  so 
become  schematised  categories  applying  necessarily  to  all 
objects  of  human  experience.  That  is  what  we  might  reason- 
ably expect  him  to  explain,  both  in  view  of  the  way  in  which 
he  opens  this  chapter2  and  in  view  of  his  discussion  of  the  pure 
synthesis.  The  'ideas'  into  which  the  transcendental  content 
is  thus  introduced  would  be  the  pure  concepts  of  the  under- 
standing; and  this  seems  to  be  borne  out  by  the  fact  that 

1  In   B  133-4  n-  tne  analytic  unity  of   consciousness  is  said  to  be 
inherent  in  all  'common*  concepts  as  such,  that  is,  in  all  concepts  as 
involving  the  thought  of  what  is  common  to  different  individuals. 
This  confirms  the  interpretation  which  I  have  given.  The  fact  that 
the   much  needed  explanation  of  Analytic  unity'  is  given,   in  the 
second  edition,  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  does  not  mean  that 
it  has  no  bearing  on  the  present  passage.  The  Transcendental  Deduc- 
tion in  the  second  edition  attempts  in  its  first  part  to  connect  the 
argument  with  the  Metaphysical  Deduction,  just  as  it  attempts  in 
its  second  part  to  connect  the  argument  with  the  Transcendental 
Schematism. 

There  are  further  references  to  analytic  and  synthetic  unity  in  the 
Lose  Blatter,  see  Reickc,  Vol.  I,  p.  114-16,  B  12.

the  ideas  in  question  are  described  as  its  ideas,  that  is,  as  ideas 
of  the  understanding}-  Because  these  ideas  receive  a  transcen- 
dental content,  they  can  be  called  pure  concepts  of  the  under- 
standing which  apply  a  priori  to  objects.2 

This  is,  I  believe,  the  general  direction  of  Kant's  thought, 
but  we  must  be  on  our  guard  against  an  undue  simplification 
of  the  present  statement.  He  does  not  say,  as  we  might  have 
expected,  that  understanding  introduces  a  transcendental 
content  into  its  ideas  'by  means  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the 
pure  manifold  of  time  and  space'.3  On  the  contrary,  under- 
standing produces  this  result  'by  means  of  the  synthetic  unity 
of  the  manifold  in  intuition  in  general'.  'Intuition  in  general 
cannot  be  identified  with  pure  intuition :  pure  intuition  is  only 
a  species  of  which  intuition  in  general  is  the  genus.  And  it  is  to 
be  noted  that  in  the  following  paragraph  Kant  says  that  the 
pure  concepts  of  the  understanding  apply  a  priori  to  objects 
of  intuition  in  general. 

It  is  difficult  to  be  sure  how  far  Kant  is  stressing  the  tech- 
nical sense  in  which  'intuition  in  general'  is  employed  later,4 
but  we  certainly  cannot  set  aside  this  possibility.  If  we  take 
the  ideas'  of  the  understanding  to  be  the  pure  concepts  of  the 
understanding,  a  definition  of  such  concepts  has  just  been 
given  :5  they  are  concepts  of  the  unity  given  by  understanding 

1  It  might  be  suggested  that  'its  ideas'  means  only  the  ideas  with 
which  the  understanding  is  concerned  in  judging,  and  that  under- 
standing introduces  into  them  the  transcendental  content  of  substance 
and  accident,  cause  and  effect,  and  so  on.  This  would  be  a  correct 
statement  of  Kant's  doctrine,  except  that  what  is  introduced  would, 
I  think,  be  described,  not  as  a  transcendental  content,  but  as  a  trans- 
cendental form.  But  in  any  case  the  statement  which  follows — that 
'on  this  account  they  are  called  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding* 
— puts   this   interpretation   out  of  court.    Caird's   translation   (The 
Critical  Philosophy  of  Kant,  Vol.  I,  p.  329),  which  makes  'they*  refer 
to  the  acts  of  the  understanding,  seems  to  me  impossible. 

2  The  relative  clause  would  then  be  the  emphatic  one. 
3Prichard  (Kant's  Theory  of  Knowledge,  p.   164)  translates  as  if 

Kant  had  said  this. 

4  See  especially  B  151.  The  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition 
in  general  is  said  to  be  an  intellectual  synthesis  thought  in  the  pure 
category.  6  A  79  =  B  105. 


XIV  §  7]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  291 

to  the  'mere  synthesis'  of  different  ideas  in  an  intuition.1 
If  'mere  synthesis'  is  equivalent — as  I  rather  suspect  it  is — to 
'synthesis  in  general',  the  definition  may  imply  that  the  pure 
categories  are  concepts  of  the  synthetic  unity2  of  the  manifold 
of  intuition  in  general. 

By  its  acts  of  judgement,  so  far  as  they  give  us  knowledge 
of  real  objects,  understanding  may  be  said  to  introduce  a 
transcendental  content  into  the  pure  categories,  because  in 
imposing  synthetic  unity  on  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general, 
it  necessarily  imposes  synthetic  unity  on  the  pure  manifold 
of  time  and  space.  The  synthetic  unity  of  the  pure  manifold 
of  time  and  space  would  then  be  the  transcendental  content3 
which  the  pure  categories  must  receive  if  they  are  to  apply 
a  priori  to  objects  of  human  experience.  When  they  receive 
this  content  they  may  be  regarded  as  schematised  categories, 
the  full  categories  which  are  necessary  for  all  human  experience. 

Such  is  at  any  rate  a  correct  statement  of  Kant's  general 
theory,  but  I  must  confess  I  doubt  whether  he  intends  to  make 
explicit  here  the  reference  to  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  pure 
manifold  of  time  and  space.  We  must,  I  think,  introduce  this 
reference,  if  we  suppose  that  the  'transcendental  content' 
is  different  from  'the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  intuition 
i/i  general'  by  means  of  which  it  is  said  to  be  introduced.  But 
it  is  possible,  and  perhaps  even  probable,  especially  in  view 
of  the  following  paragraph,  that  Kant  wishes  to  identify, 

1  Compare  §  4  above. 

2  A  concept  of  the  unity  given  to  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold 
of  intuition   in  general    is  a  concept  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the 
manifold  of  intuition  in  general.  Compare  what  Kant  says  in  A  78-9 
=   B   104,  about  pure  concepts:    that  they  give  unity  to  the  pure 
synthesis   and    consist  solely   in    the   representation   of  this   necessary 
synthetic  unity. 

3  In  A  79  =  B  104  and  A  78  =•=  B  104  Kant  has  already  asserted 
that  the  categories  must  be  concepts  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the 
pure  manifold  of  time  and  space.  At  the  present  stage  of  the  argument 
this  may  seem  barely  intelligible,  but  we  shall  discover  in  the  Principles 
that  all  the  categories — and  notably  those  of  substance  and  accident 
and  cause  and  effect — are  imposed  on  empirical  objects  in  virtue  of 
the  unity  of  time  and  space. 


292  THE   METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  7 

rather  than  to  distinguish,  these  two  things.  If  so,  he  is  con- 
cerned with  the  pure,  and  not  with  the  schematised,  cate- 
gories ;  and  he  is  saying  that  the  synthetic  unity  of  intuitions 
in  general  (and  so  of  all  possible  objects  of  knowledge)  is 
demanded  or  imposed  by  the  very  nature  of  judgement  or 
conception  as  such.  This  ultimate  synthetic  unity  demanded 
or  imposed  by  thought  is  the  transcendental  content  introduced 
by  judgement;  and  such  synthetic  unity  must  have  different 
forms  or  aspects  according  as  judgement  itself  has  different 
forms  or  aspects.  If  we  interpret  Kant  in  this  way,  it  is  easier 
to  understand,  not  only  what  he  says  immediately  thereafter, 
but  also  the  very  real  difficulties  which  he  raises  at  the  begin- 
ning of  the  Transcendental  Deduction.1 

There  are,  I  admit,  objections  to  this  interpretation.  If  we 
accept  it,  Kant's  statement  fails  to  gather  together  the  different 
threads  in  the  preceding  argument ;  it  establishes  no  connexion 
between  the  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold  previously  discussed 
and  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general;  and 
it  seems  to  contradict  the  assertion  that  apart  from  the  manifold 
of  pure  intuition  the  categories  are  without  content.21  I  do  not 
think  that  these  objections  are  insurmountable.  Kant  expects 
us  to  remember  that  the  reason  why  thought  can  impose 
necessary  synthetic  unity  on  our  human  intuitions  is  that  they 
are  given  to  us  under  the  forms  of  time  and  space,  and  that  the 
pure  manifold  of  time  and  space  can  be  synthetised  a  priori. 
He  has  already  indicated  that  this  is  so,  but  he  intends  to 
elaborate  this  doctrine  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction.  And 
although  the  categories  have  a  concrete  transcendental  content 
only  in  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  of  time  and  space  (and 
so  in  the  synthetic  unity  of  all  objects  given  in  time  and  space), 
they  may  nevertheless  have  an  abstract  transcendental  content 
in  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general.3 

1 A  88  =  B  120  ff.  2  A  77  -  B  102. 

3  Thus  in  Logik  §  5  Anmerk.  1-2  (IX  94)  Kant  indicates  that 
the  categories  may  contain  something  borrowed  from  understanding, 
and  that  the  origin  of  their  matter  is  intellectual;  and  in  §  3  (IX  92) 
he  says  explicitly  that  the  categories  originate  in  the  understanding 
as  regards  their  content. 


XIV  §  8]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  293 

One  point  more  must  be  added,  if  we  are  to  keep  clear  in  our 
minds  the  tasks  which  belong  to  ordinary  unreflective  under- 
standing and  the  tasks  which  belong  to  Formal  and  Transcen- 
dental Logic.  Understanding,  in  all  judgements,  produces  the 
form  of  judgement,  and  this  form  is  reflectively  analysed 
by  Formal  Logic.  Understanding,  in  all  judgements  which 
give  us  knowledge  of  objects,  imposes  upon  the  synthesis 
of  imagination,  and  so  upon  the  manifold  synthetised,  those 
principles  of  synthesis  which  are  present  in  judgement  as  its 
necessary  forms;  and  it  is  the  task  of  Transcendental  Logic 
to  show  reflectively  that  the  forms  of  judgement  can  therefore 
be  regarded  as  concepts  of  any  and  every  possible  object 
of  knowledge.1  The  latter  task  cannot  be  performed  by  Formal 
Logic;  but  in  Kant's  view  Transcendental  Logic  is  only 
carrying  a  stage  further  the  investigation  of  Formal  Logic 
into  the  nature  of  judgement  as  such. 

§  8.  The  Categories  and  the  Forms  of  Judgement 

Kant's  conclusion  is  that  there  are  precisely  as  many  pure 
concepts  of  the  understanding  as  there  are  logical  forms 
of  judgement.  This  is  the  central  contention  of  the  Meta- 
physical Deduction,  and  whether  we  agree  with  it  or  not,  we 
should  now  be  in  a  position  to  understand  its  meaning. 

Every  judgement,  as  is  rightly  held  by  Formal  Logic,  unites 
ideas.  It  does  so  inasmuch  as  it  unites  the  concepts  or  cog- 
nitions2 which  are  its  matter,  and  thereby  unites  the  different 
ideas  or  objects  to  which  these  concepts  or  cognitions  refer. 
The  unity  thus  given  to  ideas  or  objects  is  an  analytic  unity: 
it  is  a  unity  obtained  by  analysis  and  abstraction  of  the  common 
characteristics  which  the  different  objects  share.  Nevertheless 
this  analytic  unity  has  certain  aspects  which  are  independent 
of  the  particular  matter  analysed  or  judged ;  for  every  judge- 

1  The  essential  characteristic  of  any  and  every  object  of  knowledge 
is  nothing  other  than  its  necessary  synthetic  unity;  compare  A  104-5, 
A  109,  B  137,  A  158  =  B  197. 

2  I  use  this  term  to  cover  hypothetical  and  disjunctive  judgements, 
which,  according  to  Kant,  combine  judgements  rather  than  concepts. 


294  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION         [XIV  §  8 

ment  must  unite  its  concepts  or  cognitions,  and  consequently 
its  objects,  in  certain  necessary  ways.  The  forms  of  judgement 
are  the  different  ways  in  which  judgement  as  such  necessarily 
unites  its  ideas  or  objects;  and  these  forms  are  independent 
of  the  particular  nature  of  the  concepts  which  happen  to  be 
employed  and  the  particular  nature  of  the  objects  which  happen 
to  be  judged.  If  we  are  to  take  Kant's  thought  at  its  best,  we 
must  take  these  forms  to  be  'moments'  present  in  all  judge- 
ments without  exception.  The  subordinate  divisions  recognised 
by  Formal  Logic  are  alternatives;1  but  we  must  regard  these 
alternatives  as  merely  stressing  a  particular  'moment'  of  judge- 
ment, not  as  excluding  the  other  'moments'.2 

Kant  has  maintained  that  every  judgement,  if  it  gives  us 
knowledge,  also  imposes  unity  upon  the  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion whereby  given  intuitions  are  combined  into  individual 
objects  whose  common  characteristics  are  thought  in  the 
judgement.  His  present  contention  is  that  the  forms  of  judge- 
ment, just  as  they  unite  ideas  or  objects  in  different  ways, 
must  also  impose  different  kinds  of  unity  on  the  synthesis 
of  imagination ;  and  so  must  impose  different  kinds  of  synthetic 
unity  on  the  objects  judged.  These  different  kinds  of  synthetic 
unity  will  also  be  independent  of  the  particular  nature  of  the 
intuitions  given  to  sense  and  combined  into  objects. 

Considered  in  its  most  general  aspect  Kant's  contention 
seems  to  me  reasonable  and  sound.  Judgement  does  impose 
an  analytic  unity  on  the  objects  which  it  judges;  and  this 
analytic  unity  is,  and  must  be,  expressed  in  whatever  forms 
are  universally  necessary  to  judgement,  whatever  be  the 
character  of  the  objects  judged.  Similarly  judgement  does 
demand  a  synthetic  unity  in  the  objects  which  it  is  to  analyse 
and  judge;  and  this  demand  must  be  satisfied  because  the 

1  If  a  judgement  is  affirmative,  it  is  not  negative;  and  so  on.  On 
the  other  hand  a  judgement  may  be  affirmative  and  categorical  and 
universal  and  assertoric:  so  it  is  only  the  subdivisions  which  are 
alternatives,  not  the  main  divisions. 

2  A  footnote  in  Prol.  §  20  (IV  302  n.)  suggests  that  for  the  purpose 
of  deriving  the  categories  the  subdivisions  are  not  to  be  regarded  as 
mutually  exclusive  alternatives. 


XIV  §  8]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  295 

transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  must  combine  the 
given  manifold  in  one  time  and  space.  We  may  perhaps  even 
go  further  and  say  that  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  imposed 
by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  on  time  and 
space,  and  so  on  all  objects  in  time  and  space,  is  ultimately  due 
to  the  demand  of  thought  for  synthetic  unity  in  its  objects 
and  indeed  in  its  objective  world  as  a  whole. 

We  are  not  yet  in  a  position  to  decide  whether  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination,  in  combining  all  objects  in  one 
time  and  space,  imposes  upon  these  objects  characteristics 
which  conform  to  the  different  kinds  of  synthetic  unity  de- 
manded by  the  different  forms  of  judgement;1  and  still  less 
are  we  in  a  position  to  decide  whether  it  does  so  in  obedience 
to  the  demands  of  thought,  and  not  merely  as  a  consequence 
of  the  given  character  of  time  and  space.  These  ultimate 
problems  can  be  solved  only  in  the  light  of  Kant's  subsequent 
account  of  the  transcendental  schemata  and  the  Principles.  All 
that  we  can  reasonably  ask  at  present  is  whether  the  different 
forms  of  thought  do  demand  different  kinds  of  synthetic  unity 
in  its  objects.2  It  is  difficult  to  state  the  demands  which  pure 
thought  makes  upon  its  objects;  for  these  demands,  as  Kant 
always  recognises,  remain  comparatively  vague  until  wre  con- 
sider them  in  their  relation  to  a  temporal  and  spatial  world. 
Nevertheless  it  is  not  impossible,  even  at  this  stage,  to  indicate 
their  general  character.  So  far  as  thought  is  conceptual,  so  far, 
that  is  to  say,  as  it  seeks  to  unite  a  plurality  of  individual 
objects  in  a  whole  (or  class)  in  virtue  of  their  common  charac- 
teristics, it  seems  to  demand  that  the  given  objects  should  be 
in  some  way  homogeneous.  So  far  as  thought  is  assertive, 
so  far,  that  is  to  say,  as  it  affirms  and  denies  and  thereby  de- 
limits, it  seems  to  demand  that  the  given  objects  should  some- 
how combine  in  themselves  being  and  not-being.  So  far  as 

1  Compare  Chapter  XXXIII  for  the  transcendental  schemata  and 
their  relation  to  the  categories. 

2  The  further  question  whether  it  imposes  these  different  kinds  of 
synthetic  unity  on  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  and 
so  upon  all  objects,  is  one  which  will  fall  to  be  considered  later; 
see  Chapter  XXXIV  §  3. 


296  THE  METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  8 

thought  is  about  reality  and  makes  a  distinction  between 
subject  and  predicate,  it  seems  to  demand  that  the  given 
objects  should  somehow  offer  us  an  ultimate  subject  as  well 
as  characteristics  belonging  to  that  subject.  So  far  as  thought 
is  based  on  reasons  or  grounds,  it  seems  to  demand  that  the 
given  objects  should  somehow  offer  us  a  combination  of  grounds 
and  consequents.  So  far  as  thought  separates  off  different 
classes  of  objects  from  one  another  within  a  whole,  it  seems 
to  demand  that  the  given  objects  should  somehow  constitute 
a  system  whose  different  parts  mutually  exclude  and  mutually 
determine  one  another.  And  so  far  as  thought  is  possible, 
actual,  and  necessary,  it  seems  to  demand  that  its  objects 
should  also  be  in  some  way  possible,  actual,  and  neces- 
sary.1 Indeed  do  not  demands  of  this  kind  seem  to  be 
necessary  demands,  if  we  accept  a  correspondence  view  of 
truth? 

However  vague  this  may  be,  it  is  far  from  meaningless,  and 
it  rests  upon  the  necessary  forms  of  thought,  which  are  im- 
perfectly expressed  in  the  table  of  the  forms  of  judgement. 
Its  full  meaning  will  become  clear  only  when  we  can  indicate 
those  characteristics  of  physical  objects  in  space  and  time 
in  virtue  of  which  the  demands  of  thought  must  be  satisfied. 
But  it  seems  to  me  there  is  no  ground  for  suggesting,  as  is  so 
commonly  done  to-day,  that  Kant's  theory  is  merely  a  con- 
fusion of  thought,  or  that  it  rests  on  a  pedantic  attempt  to 
establish  artificial  parallels  between  Formal  and  Transcen- 
dental Logic.  His  theory,  no  doubt,  has  been  frequently 
misunderstood;  but  this  is  no  reason  why  we  should  regard 
it  as  in  itself  unintelligible. 

We  should  now  be  able  to  understand  why  Kant  believed 
that  the  various  forms  of  judgement  not  only  play  the  part 
in  thinking  assigned  to  them  by  Formal  Logic,  but  also  have 
at  least  a  prima  facie  claim  to  determine  the  character  of  the 
objects  judged.  So  far  as  they  determine  the  character  of  the 
object  judged  they  are  to  be  regarded  as  categories ;  and  cor-

Chapter  XXXIII. 


XIV  §  9]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  297 

responding  to  the  forms  of  judgement  we  have  the  following 
table  of  categories.1 

The  categories  under  the  head  of  quantity  are  unity,  plurality, 
and  totality;2  under  the  head  of  quality  reality,  negation,  and 
limitation ;  under  the  head  of  relation  subsistence  and  inherence 
(substantia  et  accident),  causality  and  dependence  (cause  and 
effect),  and  communion3  (interaction4  between  agent  and 
patient);  under  the  head  of  modality  possibility  and  impossi- 
bility, being  and  not-being,6  necessity  and  contingency. 

§  9.  The  Clue  to  the  Discovery  of  the  Categories 

Kant's  argument  in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  is  con- 
cerned, as  he  himself  indicates,  with  the  clue  to  the  discovery 
of  all  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding.  If  we  take  it  as 
offering  a  complete  proof  of  the  origin,  nature,  and  objective 
validity  of  the  categories,  we  cannot  but  regard  it  as  arbitrary 
and  superficial.  Such  a  view  fails  to  do  justice  to  the  subtlety 
of  Kant's  thinking,  and  we  must  recognise  that  we  have  here 
only  the  beginning  of  the  long  and  complicated  argument 
by  which  he  seeks  to  establish  his  conclusions. 

The  position  which  we  have  now  reached  would  have  been 
clearer,  if  it  had  been  put  forward  as  the  hypothesis  which 
he  intends  to  prove.  Instead  of  doing  so,  Kant  has  chosen, 
not  only  to  state  the  general  logical  position  from  which  he 
starts,  but  also  to  suggest  the  general  line  of  argument  which 
he  proposes  to  follow.  There  is  in  this  procedure  nothing 

1  See   A  80  =   B  106.    For  the   list  of  forms  of  judgement,  see 
A  70  =  B  95. 

2  In  spite  of  this  order  I  believe  that  unity  is  connected  with  the 
singular,  and  totality  with  the  universal,  judgement;  see  Pro/.  §  20 
(IV  302  n.).

but  this  seems  to  me  less  satisfactory.

unreasonable;  but  the  indications  given  are  too  brief  to  be 
other  than  obscure,  and  I  have  been  compelled  to  supplement 
them  with  material  drawn  from  the  later  parts  of  the  argument. 
We  have  still  to  face,  as  Kant  recognises,1  the  obvious  objection 
that  the  understanding  cannot  impose  principles  of  synthesis 
on  objects  which  are  given  to  sense ;  and  we  have  to  meet  thir 
objection  by  a  full  account  of  the  nature  of  imaginative  syn- 
thesis in  its  relation  to  the  unity  of  thought,  and  in  its  relation 
to  the  pure  forms  of  time  and  space  under  which  all  objects 
must  be  given.  We  have  still  to  indicate  the  different  charac- 
teristics imposed  by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  the  pure 
manifold  of  time  and  space  on  all  sensible  objects  and  to 
connect  these  characteristics  with  the  forms  of  judgement. 
And  we  have  still  to  show  that  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination,  in  imposing  unity  upon  time  and  space,  neces- 
sarily imposes  these  characteristics  on  all  sensible  objects. 
This  is  the  work  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  and  of  the 
chapters  on  the  Schematism  of  the  Categories  and  the  Prin- 
ciples of  the  Understanding.  To  interpret  Kant  otherwise 
is  to  befog  the  whole  argument,  and  if  we  fail  to  see  it  as  a 
whole,  the  separate  parts  become  unintelligible. 

At  the  present  stage  we  should  take  Kant  to  give  us  the 
names  of  the  categories  whose  nature  and  validity  has  still 
to  be  proved.  If  the  pure  categories  are  to  be  regarded  as 
distinct  from  the  forms  of  judgement,  this  is  possible  only 
by  supposing  that  they  must  somehow  determine  the  character 
of  things;  but  no  real  object  is  thought  by  their  means,2  nor 
do  we  understand  how  they  can  apply  to  any  object.  The 
categories  have  objective  validity  only  when  they  are  schema- 
tised. Hence  Kant,  by  anticipation,  gives  to  them  names 
which  belong  properly  to  the  schematised  categories.  Thus 
he  speaks  of  the  category  of  cause  and  effect,  which  obviously 
has  a  reference  to  time.  We  must  not  allow  this  to  mislead 
us  into  supposing  that  he  imagines  himself  able  to  extract 

1 A  89  =  B  122. 

1  Compare  B  288.  If  we  do,  and  must,  think  things-in-themselves 
by  means  of  the  pure  categories,  the  thought  is  empty. 


XIV  §  9]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  299 

the  category  of  cause  and  effect  merely  from  the  hypothetical 
form  of  judgement.  His  doctrine  ought  not  to  be  either  accepted 
or  rejected  until  the  argument  has  been  carried  further. 

The  meaning  of  the  categories  is  at  the  present  stage  neces- 
sarily obscure,  but  there  is  some  plausibility  in  the  contention 
that  they  are  truly  categories  in  the  sense  that  they  character- 
ise all  possible  objects.1  What  is  surprising  is  Kant's  belief 
that,  with  the  exception  of  the  category  of  communion,  their 
connexion  with  the  corresponding  form  of  judgement  ' leaps 
to  the  eye*;2  and  he  regards  this  obvious  connexion — a  connex- 
ion which,  as  I  have  said,  is  to  be  properly  established  later — 
as  showing  their  origin  in  the  nature  of  thought.3  There  is 
indeed  some  plausibility  in  the  contention  in  certain  cases. 
When  we  assert  a  house  to  be  square,  we  are  uniting  the  given 
manifold  under  the  category  of  substance  and  accident;  and 
again  when  we  assert  that  if  it  rains,  the  ground  will  be  wet, 
we  are  uniting  the  manifold  under  the  category  of  cause  and 
effect.4  Nevertheless  it  is  clear  that  not  all  categorical  judge- 
ments apply  the  category  of  substance  and  accident,  and  not 
all  hypothetical  judgements  apply  the  category  of  cause  and 
effect.5  The  forms  of  judgement  are  categories  only  in  so  far 
as  the  manifold  of  intuition  is  determined  in  relation  to  them.8 

There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  Kant  discovered  the 
categories  originally  by  means  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction. 
On  the  contrary,  he  had  a  list  of  categories  from  the  beginning, 
and  attempted  to  deduce  them  from  a  common  principle. 

1  Except  of  course  in  the  case  of  impossibility,  not-being,  and 
contingency. 

2B  111-12.  The  category  of  communion  is  connected  with  the 
disjunctive  form  of  judgement.  We  shall  see,  in  Chapter  XXXIII 
§  4,  that  this  connexion  is  as  reasonable  as  the  others.  3  B  159. 

4  These  two  connexions  were  commonly  recognised,  and  may 
have  been  the  starting-point  of  Kant's  theory.  Compare  Riehl  (Der 
philosophische  Kriticismus,  Vol.  I,  p.  359),  who  suggests  that  Kant 
first  of  all  connected  causality  with  the  hypothetical  form  of  judgement. 

6  Compare  B  128-9. 

6  See  B  143.  There  are  many  puzzles  about  this  into  which  I  will 
not  here  enter:  the  first  thing  to  do  is  to  get  Kant's  central  position 
clear. 


300  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  10 

From  the  dawn  of  the  Copernican  revolution  he  sought  to  find 
their  origin  in  the  activity  of  the  understanding,  but  for  some 
time  he  imagined  that  this  origin  might  possibly  be  found 
in  such  activities  as  comparing,  combining,  and  separating.1 
Later  he  found  that  all  activities  of  the  understanding  could 
be  reduced  to  judgement,  and  that  judgement  with  its  necessary , 
forms  gave  him  precisely  what  he  had  been  seeking.2  If  he 
found  himself  compelled  in  the  process  of  search  to  modify 
his  list  of  categories  and  even  to  improve,  as  he  thought,  the 
table  of  logical  forms,  there  is  in  this,  taken  in  itself,  no  reason 
why  his  method  should  be  regarded  as  irrational,  and  still  less 
reason  why  we  should  reject  the  possibility  that  the  categories 
may  have  an  a  priori  origin  in  the  mind.3 

It  is  almost  unnecessary  to  add  that  until  Kant  has  demon- 
strated the  a  priori  and  systematic  character  of  the  forms 
of  judgement,  he  has  failed  to  show  any  ground  why  we  should 
believe  in  the  a  priori  and  systematic  character  of  the  categories. 

§  10.  Analytic  and  Synthetic  Judgements 

Before  leaving  the  argument  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction 
we  must  notice  an  interpretation  which  has  had  great  influence 
in  this  country.4  Formal  Logic  is  supposed  to  concern  itself 
only  with  a  special  type  of  judgements,  called  analytic  judge- 
ments,5 in  which  alone  is  to  be  found  the  form  of  judgement. 

1  Nachlass  3930  (XVII  352).  We  ought  not,  however,  to  exclude 
the  possibility  that  Kant  in  his  own  mind  connected  these  operations 
with  judgement.  2  See  Pro/.  §  39  (IV  323). 

3  We  might  as  well  suggest  that  Mathematics  is  not  a  priori,  because 
the  earliest  mathematical  discoveries  were  made  as  the  result  of  a 
process  of  trial  and  error. 

4  It  is  expounded — in  different  forms — by  Caird  and  Kemp  Smith. 

5  Analytic  judgements  are  judgements  made   by  the  analysis  of 
a  subject-concept.  To  regard  judgements  made  by  analysis  of  an  object 
as  a  subdivision  of  analytic  judgements  is  a  confusion.  To  combine 
judgements   made   by  analysis  of  a   subject-concept,    and  judge- 
ments   made    by   analysis    of   an   object,    into    a   special   class    of 
judgements,  studied   by   Formal   Logic   and   opposed   to   synthetic 
judgements,   is   to   make    confusion   worse   confounded.    Compare 
Chapter  X  §§  6-7. 


XIV  §  IQ]       THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION  301 

Transcendental  Logic  is  supposed  to  concern  itself  with 
another  type  of  judgements,  called  synthetic  judgements, 
which  are  productive  of  the  categories.  These  two  types  of 
judgement  involve  fundamentally  different  acts,  and  they  are 
alluded  to  when  Kant  speaks  of  analytic  and  synthetic 
unity.1 

The  difficulty  then  arises  how  Kant  can  say  that  the  form 
of  judgement  and  the  transcendental  content  of  the  categories 
are  produced  by  precisely  the  same  acts.  On  this  point  he  could 
not  be  more  emphatic.  Nevertheless  his  emphatic  statement 
is  watered  down  into  a  quite  different  statement — that  under- 
standing produces  these  two  results  by  different,  but  analogous, 
acts.  It  is  then  insisted  that  there  is  no  analogy  whatever 
between  the  acts ;  and  at  times  a  half-hearted  defence  of  Kant 
is  offered  us  on  the  curiously  irrelevant  ground  that  analysis 
presupposes  synthesis.  When  we  read  the  resulting  disquisi- 
tions on  Kant's  blindness  and  perversity,  his  incapacity  to 
understand  the  implications  of  his  own  argument  and  his 
devotion  to  an  external  architectonic,  we  do  well  to  remember 
that,  in  spite  of  all  the  pages  that  have  been  written  about  his 
misleading  analogy  between  synthetic  and  analytic  judgements, 
there  is  not  a  single  sentence,  throughout  the  length  and 
breadth  of  the  Kritik,  in  which  this  analogy  is  so  much  as 
mentioned. 

Kant  means  precisely  what  he  says,  and  on  this  point  he 
is  right.  Difficult  and  doubtful  as  his  theory  may  be,  we  can 
understand  why  he  believed  in  it,  as  soon  as  we  grasp  that  the 
analytic  unity,  and  the  form  of  judgement,  must  be  present 
in  all  judgements  without  exception.2  To  suppose  that  the 

1  In  A  79  =  B  105.  I  must  confess  that  even  after  I  had  succeeded 
in  freeing  myself  from  the  main  errors  in  regard  to  analytic  judge- 
ments, I  was  still  unable  to  break  away  from  the  view  that  Kant  was 
referring  in  this  passage  to  the  difference  between  analytic  and  synthetic 
judgements;  see  Mind,  Vol.  XL,  N.S.  No.  159. 

2  Adickes  (in  his  edition,  p.  120)  recognises  quite  clearly  that  all 
judgements  are  analytic  in  the  sense  of  possessing  analytic  unity, 
and  that  this  has  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  the  limited  class  of 
technically  analytic  judgements. 


3oa  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XIV  §  10 

forms  of  judgement  are  present  only  in  one  kind  of  judgement, 
and  the  categories  only  in  another  kind  of  judgement,  is  to 
make  Kant's  whole  argument,  not  only  in  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction,  but  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction  and  in  the 
Analytic  of  Principles,  completely  unintelligible. 


CHAPTER    XV 
THE  CATEGORIES 

i .  The  Categories 

The  difficult  task  of  following  Kant's  argument  in  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction  is  now  completed,  and  the  present 
chapter  will  be  concerned  only  with  relatively  minor  questions 
in  regard  to  the  categories. 

The  categories,  as  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding,  are 
naturally  contrasted  with  empirical  concepts,  but  such  a 
division  ignores  the  existence  of  mathematical  and  factitious 
concepts.  At  times  it  is  desirable  to  make  a  clear  distinction 
between  the  categories  and  all  other  concepts.  For  this  purpose 
I  describe  the  categories  as  'universal*  concepts  and  contrast 
them  with  'particular*  concepts.  A  'universal'  concept,  in  this 
special  sense,  is  one  which  applies  to  any  and  every  object; 
while  a  'particular'  concept  applies  only  to  some  objects,  that 
is,  to  objects  of  a  particular  kind.  Empirical,  mathematical,  and 
factitious  concepts  may  all  be  called  'particular':  they  apply 
to  some  objects  and  not  to  others.1 

It  should  be  observed  that  Kant  gives  no  definition  of  the 
separate  categories,  although  he  hints  that  he  might  be  in  a 
position  to  do  so.2  Later  on3  he  says  that  apart  from  the  con- 
ditions of  sensibility — that  is,  apart  from  the  forms  of  time 
and  space — they  cannot  be  defined.  By  this  he  means  that  they 
can  have  no  real  definition,  a  real  definition  being  one  which 
not  only  analyses  a  concept  and  so  makes  it  distinct,  but  also 
shows  that  it  contains  a  mark  whereby  the  object?  to  which  the 
concept  refers  can  be  recognised  with  certainty.  Each  pure 
category  can,  of  course,  be  defined  as  the  concept  of  a  par- 

1  Compare  Chapter  IX  §5.  a  A  82  =  B  108. 

3  A  241-2 ;  A  240  =  B  300. 

4  In  a  real  definition  the  thing  defined  (the  definitum)  is  the  object 
and  not  merely  the  concept,  and  the  possibility  of  the  object  must 
be  made  intelligible;  see  A  241-2  n.  and  B  300. 


304  THE  METAPHYSICAL  DEDUCTION        [XV  §  i 

ticular  form  of  judgement  which  is  supposed  somehow  to 
characterise  all  things  without  exception.1  Kant  never  varies, 
so  far  as  I  can  see,  in  his  belief  that  the  pure  categories,  when 
we  abstract  from  all  reference  to  time  and  space,  must  be 
regarded  as  concepts,  not  of  an  object  in  general,  but  of  a  thing 
in  general,  that  is,  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.  Indeed 
so  far  as  we  can  think  things-in-themselves  at  all,  we  must 
do  so  by  means  of  the  pure  categories,  for  all  thinking 
contains  the  forms  of  judgement;  but  such  thought,  apart 
from  intuition,  is  so  vague  as  to  be  meaningless;  more 
exactly,  all  relation  to  objects  falls  away  in  the  sense 
that  'we  cannot  through  any  example  make  comprehensible 
to  ourselves  what  sort  of  a  thing  is  to  be  meant  by  such  a 
concept'.2 

It  is  only  as  schematised  that  the  categories  can  have  a  real 
definition,  since  it  is  only  because  of  their  relation  to  the 
synthesis  of  time  and  space  that  we  can  establish  their  necessary 
applicability  to  all  objects  of  human  experience.  We  may, 
if  we  will,  maintain  that  the  schematised  categories  are  the 
only  real  categories ;  for  it  is  by  them  alone  that  we  have  know- 
ledge of  the  universal  character  of  real  objects.  It  is  sometimes 
held  that  Kant  ought  not  to  have  considered  the  pure  categories 
at  all,  but  should  have  confined  himself  to  the  schematised 
categories.  Such  a  view  is  inevitable,  if  we  accept  the  perverse 
misinterpretations  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  prevalent 
in  this  country;  and,  even  apart  from  these  misinterpretations, 
the  theory  that  the  schematised  categories  are  involved  in  the 

1  Or,  in  Kant's  language,  to  be  'the  condition  of  the  possibility 
of  things  themselves';  see  A  242. 

2  A  241  =  B  300.  When  Kant  says,  as  he  does  repeatedly,  that  the 
pure  categories  are  without  sense  and  without  meaning  (ohne  Sinn 
und  Bedeutung),  he  is  not  denying  that  the  pure  concepts  have  as 
their  content  the  principles  of  synthesis  contained  in  the  forms  of 
judging ;  he  is  only  asserting  that  we  have  no  means  of  showing  their 
objective  validity,  that  is,  of  showing  how  they  can  apply  to  any 
real  object.  He  even  asserts  (in  A  239-40  =  B  299)  that  mathematical 
concepts  would  be  without  sense  and  meaning,  unless  we  could  give 
corresponding  examples  in  empirical  intuition.  All  this  will  be  discussed 
more  fully  in  Chapters  LIV-LVI. 


XV  §  2]  THE  CATEGORIES  305 

nature  of  time  and  space  as  such,1  and  have  nothing  to  do  with 
principles  of  synthesis  imposed  by  the  nature  of  human  thought, 
is  worthy  of  the  most  serious  consideration.  It  is,  however, 
a  theory  fundamentally  different  from  that  of  Immanuel  Kant ; 
and  if  we  have  understood  the  Metaphysical  Deduction,  we 
must  see  that  whether  Kant  is  right  or  wrohg,  his  doctrine 
is  a  consistent  whole  of  which  the  relation  of  the  schematised 
categories  to  the  pure  categories  is  an  absolutely  essential  part. 
In  view  of  the  importance  of  the  schematised  categories, 
it  is  often  convenient  to  refer  to  them  simply  as  Categories' — 
this  is  in  fact  the  common  practice  of  Kant  himself.  When  the 
pure  categories  alone  are  in  question,  they  should  be  called 
explicitly  'pure  categories'. 

§  2.  Trichotomy  of  the  Categories 

In  a  passage  added  in  the  second  edition  Kant  points  out 
that  there  are  three  categories  in  each  class.  The  third  category 
in  each  class  arises  from  a  combination  of  the  second  with  the 
first.  It  requires,  however,  a  special  act  of  the  understanding 
to  produce  the  third  category,  and  it  must  not  be  thought  that 
the  third  category  is  a  derivative,  rather  than  an  original  or 
primary,  concept.2 

In  his  defence  of  the  independence  of  the  third  category 
Kant  goes  so  far  as  to  suggest  that  the  third  category  may  not 
be  applicable  in  cases  where  the  first  two  categories  are.  He 
suggests  that  number,  for  example,  which  is  the  schema  of 
the  category  of  totality,3  may  not  be  applicable  in  cases  where 
plurality  and  unity  are:  it  may  not  apply  to  infinity.4  I  doubt 
whether  this  is  a  good  argument,  since  the  categories  are 
concepts  of  objects,  and  no  category,  properly  speaking,  applies 
to  infinity,  which  is  not  an  object  at  all.  Furthermore  a  category 
which  did  not  apply  to  every  object  would  not  be  a  category. 

1  I  take  this  to  be  the  view  of  Professor  Alexander. 

2  B  iio-n.  Compare  Pro/.  §  39  (IV  325  n.). 

3  This  will  be  explained  in  Chapter  XXXIII  §  2. 

4  Compare  also   letter  to    Schulz  (X  344-5)  translated  by  Kemp 
Smith,  Commentary  y  p.  199.  I  suppose  that  the  theory  of  transfinite 
numbers  throws  doubt  on  Kant's  contention. 


306  THE  METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION         [XV  §  3 

Kant  is,  however,  clearly  right  in  saying  that  the  third  category 
is,  in  each  case,  a  concept  as  ultimate  as  the  other  two. 

Kant  seems  to  me  to  be  also  right  in  saying  that  the  third 
category  involves  a  combination  of  the  first  two.  This  is  obvious 
in  the  first  three  classes  of  categories,  and  for  the  present 
we  may  perhaps  be  content  to  await  his  explanation  of  the 
dark  saying  that  necessity  is  existence  (or  being)  given  through 
possibility  itself. 

This  doctrine  of  Kant  is  one  of  the  roots  of  the  Hegelian 
dialectic,  and  it  is  unreasonable  to  dismiss  it  as  due  to  a  super- 
stitious preference  for  the  number  three.  Kant's  divisions  are 
not  dominated  by  the  number  three;  there  are,  for  example, 
four  classes  of  categories  and  two  forms  of  intuition.  Our 
business  is  to  understand  his  divisions,  and  not  to  dismiss 
them  as  irrational. 

The  only  division  possible  by  a  priori  principles  is,  according 
to  Kant,  dichotomy,  which  depends  on  the  principle  that 
everything  must  be  either  A  or  not — A.  Polytomy,  as  he  calls 
it,  depends  upon  intuition,  which  may  be  either  a  priori,  as  in 
mathematics  (e.g.  in  the  case  of  conic  sections),  or  empirical, 
as  in  the  case  of  natural  science.  There  is,  however,  also 
a  trichotomy  which  depends  upon  the  principle  of  a  priori 
synthesis.  Three  things  are  necessary  for  every  a  priori  syn- 
thesis: (i)  a  condition,  (2)  a  conditioned,  and  (3)  that  which 
arises  from  the  union  of  the  two.1  This  is  important  to 
remember  when  we  come  to  study  the  schemata. 

One  can  only  wish  that  Kant  had  explained  how  these 
principles  of  division  are  manifested  in  his  table  of  the  logical 
forms  of  judgement.2 

§  3.  The  Categories  and  Generic  Concepts 

Kant  has  been  criticised  on  the  ground  that  he  confuses 
categories  with  generic  concepts,  and  makes  the  mistake 

1Log.  §  113  (IX  147-8).  Compare  K.d.U.  (V  197  n.)  and  letter  to 
Schulz  (X  344). 

2  He  apparently  considered  that  they  did  apply.  See  Nachlass  3067 
(XVI  639). 


XV  §4]  THE  CATEGORIES  307 

of  viewing  the  categories  as  if  they  were  possible  predicates, 
whereas  their  real  function  is  to  articulate  the  judgement 
as  a  whole.1 

I  fail  to  see  the  point  of  such  a  criticism.  Every  concept 
is  in  a  sense  a  generic  concept — in  the  sense,  namely,  that 
it  applies  to  a  number  of  individual  instances;2  and  every 
concept  is  the  predicate  of  a  possible  judgement.  To  this  rule 
the  categories  are  no  exception.3  It  is  of  course  true  that  they 
may  articulate  the  judgement  as  a  whole,  and  even  that  they 
normally  do  so.  In  the  judgement  'If  the  trigger  is  pulled,  the 
cartridge  will  explode*  the  manifold  is  synthetised  under  the 
concept  of  cause  and  effect.  I  cannot,  however,  detect  the 
slightest  impropriety  in  saying  that  the  pulling  of  the  trigger 
is  the  cause,  and  the  explosion  of  the  cartridge  the  effect;  or 
even  in  saying  that  the  two  events  together  are  a  particular 
instance  of  cause  and  effect. 

In  this  matter  Kant,  so  far  as  I  can  see,  suffers  from  no 
confusion  and  is  guilty  of  no  mistake. 

§  4.  The  Predicables 

There  are  a  certain  number  of  pure,  but  derivative,  con- 
cepts of  the  understanding  which  Kant  calls  'predicates'.4 
He  suggests  that  these  are  derived  by  combining  the 
categories  with  one  another  and  with  the  modes  of  pure 
sensibility. 

Kant  believes  that  such  derivative  concepts  could  be  worked 
out  easily  with  the  help  of  handbooks  of  Ontology,  such  as  the 
Metaphysica  of  Baumgarten.  This  task,  while  obligatory  for 

1  See  Kemp  Smith,  Commentary,  p.  335,  etc. 

2  Except  in  the  case  of  concepts  which  can  have  only  one  instance, 
as  e.g.  the  concept  of  an  omnipotent  being. 

8  The  categories,  like  any  other  concepts,  are  made  'clear*  only 
when  they  are  'extracted'  from  experience  by  means  of  analysis; 
compare  A  196  =  B  241,  A  86  =  B  118-19,  and  B  1-2.  Compare 
also  Logik  §  5  (IX  93-4).  This  is  not  in  the  least  inconsistent  with 
the  theory  that  their  logical  or  objective  origin  is  to  be  found  in  the 
nature  of  thought  or  judgement  as  such. 

4  A  81-2  =  B  107-8 ;  A  204  =  B  249  ff. :  Pro/.  §  39  (IV  324,  325  n.). 


3o8  THE  METAPHYSICAL   DEDUCTION         [XV  §  5 

a  writer  who  is  trying  to  produce  a  complete  System  of  pure 
reason,  is  not  necessary  when  we  are  concerned  only  with  its 
Kritik.  An  attempt  to  articulate  the  system  in  more  detail 
is  made  in  the  Metaphysische  Anfangsgriinde  der  Naturwissen- 
schaft1  and  in  the  Opus  Postumum.2 

The  chief  importance  of  the  indications  here  given  in  regard 
to  the  predicables  lies  in  this,  that  Kant  regards  causality 
as  involving  force,  action,  and  passion.  This  fact  is,  I  think, 
fatal  to  the  view  that  by  causality  Kant  meant  necessary  succes- 
sion and  nothing  more. 

§  5.  Is  the  List  of  Categories  Complete  ? 

In  the  first  edition  Kant  does  not  ask  whether  there  are 
other  concepts  with  a  claim  to  the  title  of  category.  He  has  too 
much  confidence  in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction.  Yet  such 
a  question  should  be  asked  and  answered,  even  if  only  for  the 
purpose  of  confirming  his  argument. 

In  the  second  edition3  he  does  consider  three  possible 
claimants  to  the  title — the  traditional  unum,  verum,  bonum, 
which  derives  from  Aristotle,  and  was  prominent  in  the  Schol- 
astics, but  by  the  time  of  Kant  was  already  becoming  anti- 
quated. This  section  has,  like  so  much  else,  been  ascribed 
to  his  devotion  to  'architectonic'.  It  is,  on  the  contrary,  a 
proper  discussion  of  concepts  which  had  a  traditional  claim 
to  the  title  of  category;  and  it  would  be  a  sounder  criticism 
to  say  that  his  confidence  in  his  architectonic,  that  is  to  say, 
his  confidence  in  the  organic  nature  of  his  system  of  categories, 
is  responsible  for  his  neglect  to  examine  other  concepts  which 
ought  also  to  have  been  examined. 

In  the  Amphiboly  of  Concepts  of  Reflexion4  he  discusses 
other  concepts  which  look  as  if  they  might  well  be  called 
categories — identity  and  difference,  agreement  and  opposition, 
inner  and  outer,  form  and  matter.  He  does  so,  however,  in 

1  Adickes  examines  this  work  carefully,  but  unsympathetically,  in 
Kant  als  Naturforscher,  Berlin,  1924. 

2  See  Adickes,  Kants  Opus  Postumum,  Berlin,  1920.

XV  §  5]  THE  CATEGORIES  309 

quite  another  connexion,  as  a  criticism  of  the  philosophy 
of  Leibniz. 

Broadly  speaking,  he  denies  all  these  concepts  to  be  categories, 
on  the  ground  that  they  are  concerned  with  the  nature  of  truth, 
and  not  with  the  nature  of  reality,  although  they  have  been 
supposed,  by  a  confusion  of  thought,  to  give  us  knowledge 
of  reality. 

Kant's  examination  of  the  unum,  verum,  bonum  is  highly 
ingenious,  but  has  now  at  the  most  a  historical  interest.  Even 
here  his  argument  is  not  an  artificial  one  invented  for  the 
occasion,  but  is  connected  with  the  doctrine  of  logical  perfec- 
tion discussed  in  his  own  lectures  on  Logic  and  in  the  textbook 
of  G.  F.  Meier.  The  argument  of  the  Amphiboly  is  on  an 
entirely  different  footing,  and  is  a  penetrating  criticism  of  the 
metaphysical  doctrines  of  Leibniz,  and  of  the  school  of  thought 
for  which  he  stands. 


BOOK  V 

THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION 
INTRODUCTORY   EXPOSITION 


CHAPTER    XVI 
THE   PROBLEM 

§  i .  Divisions  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction 

The  Transcendental  Deduction  of  the  Categories  has,  it 
must  be  remembered,  two  sides,  an  objective  side  and  a 
subjective  side.1  In  the  first  edition  it  is  divided  into  three 
sections:  (i)  an  introduction,  (2)  a  provisional  exposition,  and 
(3)  an  authoritative  exposition.  In  the  second  edition  the 
second  and  third  sections  were  withdrawn,  and  a  new  and 
clearer  statement  put  in  their  place. 

The  first  section  is  thus  the  only  one  which  is  retained  in 
the  second  edition.  It  was  no  doubt  retained  because  of  the 
lucidity  which  distinguishes  it  alike  from  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction  and  from  the  rest  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
in  the  first  edition.  It  is  divided  into  two  subsections,  the 
first2  of  which  states  the  problem,  and  the  second3  Kant's 
method  of  solution.  In  the  present  chapter  we  shall  be  concerned 
only  with  his  statement  of  the  problem. 

§  2.  Principles  of  a  Transcendental  Deduction 

The  word  'deduction*,  Kant  explains,  is  used  in  its  juristic, 
and  not  in  its  logical,  sense.  It  is  concerned  with  vindicating 
a  right,  and  not  with  establishing  a  fact.  The  Transcendental 
Deduction  of  the  Categories  attempts  to  show  the  legitimacy 
of  applying  the  categories  to  objects,  and  it  might  in  English 
be  called  a  'justification',  rather  than  a  'deduction',  of  the 
categories. 

The  use  of  the  word  'deduction'  is  apt  to  mislead  beginners. 
They  not  unnaturally  expect  an  account  of  the  way  in  which 
the  separate  categories  are  'deduced'  from  the  forms  of  judge-

ment  and  are  disappointed  to  find  that  no  attempt  is  made 
to  deal  with  the  separate  categories  at  all.  The  Transcendental 
Deduction  is  concerned  with  categories  in  general.  For  dis- 
cussion of  detailed  categories  we  must  wait  in  patience  until 
we  come  to  the  Analytic  of  Principles. 

It  must  be  clearly  understood  that  Kant,  both  in  §  13  and 
in  §  14,  has  in  mind,  not  only  a  transcendental  deduction  of 
categories,  but  a  transcendental  deduction  in  general.  Every 
a  priori  idea  requires,  as  we  shall  see,  a  transcendental  deduction 
or  justification.  This  is  true  of  time  and  space  as  well  as  of  the 
pure  concepts  of  the  understanding.  Kant's  interest,  however, 
is,  as  we  should  expect,  directed  chiefly  to  the  categories,  and 
only  in  a  secondary  degree  to  the  forms  of  intuition. 

In  Kant's  statement  of  the  problem  there  are  three  main 
points:  (i)  that  the  deduction  of  all  a  priori  ideas  must  be 
transcendental  and  not  empirical;1  (2)  that  such  a  deduction 
is  indispensable  ;2  and  (3)  that  there  are  difficulties  in  the  deduc- 
tion of  categories  which  do  not  arise  when  we  deal  with  time 
and  space.3  In  a  final  paragraph4  the  first  two  points  are 
re-emphasised  with  special  reference  to  the  category  of  cause 
and  effect. 

§  3.  Empirical  and  Transcendental  Deductions 

For  many  of  the  concepts  employed  in  human  thinking  no 
deduction  or  justification  is  ever  supplied,  and  for  some  of 
them  perhaps  no  deduction  is  necessary.  We  are,  for  example, 
entitled  to  use  an  empirical  concept — such  as  the  concept  of 
swan — if  we  find  objects  corresponding  to  this  concept  in  our 
experience.5 

1  A  84-7  =  B  116-19.  Compare  §§  3-5  of  this  chapter. 

2  A  87-8  =  B  119-21.  Compare  §  6  of  this  chapter. 

8  A  88-91  =  B  121-3.  Compare  §§  7-9  of  this  chapter.  'Er  muss 
aber  ouch  die  unvermeidliche  Schwierigkeit.  .  .  . ' — or,  in  Kemp  Smith's 
translation,  *  At  the  same  time,  if  he  is  not  to  lament.  .  .  . ' — marks 
the  beginning  of  a  new  discussion. 

4  A  91-2  =  B  123-4.  Compare  §  10  of  this  chapter. 

6  A  84  =  B  116-17.  That  we  should  find  such  objects  in  experience 
is  easy  to  understand,  since  empirical  concepts  are  derived  from 
experience  by  abstraction. 


XVI  §  3]  THE  PROBLEM  315 

There  are  other  concepts  in  common  use — such  as  'luck' 
and  'fate* — which  are  illegitimate.1  This  is  shown  on  the  rare 
occasions  when  their  validity  is  challenged ;  for  on  examination 
they  are  found  to  have  no  justification  either  in  experience  or 
in  reason. 

R&nt  assumes  that  in  human  knowledge  there  are  concepts — 
such  as  cause  and  effect — which  are  marked  out2  for  pure 
a  priori  use,  that  is,  for  use  independently  of  experience.3 
Such  use  cannot  be  adequately  justified  by  an  appeal  to  experi- 
ence; for  experience  can  never  give  us  that  universality  and 
necessity  which  are  the  criteria  of  the  a  priori*  A  justification 
of  such  use  must,  however,  be  given:  if  we  are  to  employ 
concepts  in  this  way,  we  must  explain  how  they  can  be  related 
to  objects  which  are  not  obtained  from  any  experience.5 

1  A  84  =  B  117,  'usurpiette  Begiiffe* \  compare  A  228  =  B  280. 
I  presume  these  must  be  classed  among  'factitious'  concepts;  see 
Chapter  IX  §  5. 

z<bestimmt.'  Kant  is  here  describing  the  prima  facie  character  of 
the  categories — it  is  the  business  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
to  show  that  concepts  which  seem  to  possess  this  character  really 
do  so;  compare  A  95. 

8  Note  that  in  A  86  =  B  119  it  is  their  future  employment  which 
is  said  to  be  independent  of  experience.  No  doubt  their  employment 
is  always  independent  of  experience,  though  we  can  make  them 
'clear'  to  ourselves  only  after  we  have  actually  used  them  in  experience ; 
see  A  196  =  B  241 .  But  once  we  have  made  them  'clear'  and  recognised 
their  true  character,  we  know  that  thereafter  their  employment  by 
us  must  be  independent  of  experience,  and  consequently  we  cannot 
find  their  justification  by  the  method  of  Locke. 

4  Compare  A  91-2  —  B  123-4. 

6  A  85  =  B  117.  I  do  not  think  this  need  mean  more  than  that 
a  priori  concepts  must  apply  to  objects  which  we  have  not  experienced. 
It  might  perhaps  also  mean  that  the  matter  or  content  of  these  concepts 
is  not  'borrowed'  from  experience  (or  is  not  dependent  on  what  is 
given  to  sense);  compare  A  86  =  B  118,  where  these  concepts  are 
said  to  be  related  to  their  objects  without  having  'borrowed'  from 
experience  anything  for  the  representation  of  these  objects.  I  see  no 
need  to  suppose  that  Kant  is  referring  explicitly  to  things-in- 
themselves.  If  we  assume — I  think  unnecessarily — that  he  is  making 
such  a  reference,  then  he  has  in  mind  the  claims  of  a  'transcendent* 
rationalist  metaphysics;  and  he  has  a  perfect  right  to  treat  these 
claims  as  an  open  question  in  stating  the  problem  which  is  raised 
by  the  assumption  that  we  possess  a  priori  concepts.  Furthermore — 


316        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVI  §4 

The  justification  of  the  pure  a  priori  use  of  the  categories 
is  called  the  Transcendental  Deduction.1 

A  transcendental  deduction  must  be  sharply  distinguished 
from  an  empirical  deduction.  The  former  finds  the  origin  of 
concepts  in  the  nature  of  mind  itself,  and  thereby  establishes 
their  objective  validity.  The  latter  examines  our  method  of 
acquiring  concepts;  that  is,  it  explains  how  we  gradually 
disentangle  them  from  experience,  and  make  them  'clear*  in 
our  consciousness;  it  explains,  in  short,  how  concepts  are 
acquired  by  experience  and  reflexion  upon  experience.2  I  take 
it  that  an  empirical  deduction  is,  in  the  case  of  empirical 
concepts,  really  a  deduction  or  justification — the  only  justifi- 
cation they  can  have.  In  the  case  of  a  priori  concepts,  although 
we  can  properly  give  a  similar  psychological  account  of  their 
acquisition,3  this  would  not  correctly  be  called  a  deduction, 
since  it  would  not  justify  their  a  priori  use.4 

If  we  are  to  follow  Kant's  argument,  we  must  distinguish 
clearly  between  the  origin  and  the  acquisition  of  concepts; 
and  we  must  recognise  that  the  latter  alone  is  a  temporal 
process,  the  study  of  which  belongs  properly  to  empirical 
psychology. 

§  4.  Space  and  Time  and  the  Categories 

So  far  Kant  has  been  thinking,  at  least  primarily,  of  the 
categories.  He  now  points  out  that  pure  concepts  are  of  two 

and  we  ought  never  to  forget  this — Kant  himself  always  holds  that 
the  pure  categories  are  not  limited  through  the  conditions  of  our 
sensuous  intuition,  but  have  an  unlimited  field  (compare  B  166  n. 
and  B  148):  we  must  think  things-in- themselves  by  means  of  the  pure 
categories,  although  such  thinking  is  not  knowledge. 

1  A  85  =  B  117.  In  this  passage  Kant  speaks  as  if  the  essential 
concern  of  a  transcendental  deduction  were  the  objective  validity  of 
a  priori  concepts,  but  this  in  turn  depends  on  the  explanation  of 
their  origin-,  see  Chapter  XI  §  3. 

2  Kant  might  seem  to  have  in  mind  here  the  acquisition,  or  making, 
of  concepts  as  regards  their  form,  but  as  the  deduction  in  question 
is  empirical,  it  must  be  psychological  rather  than  logical;  compare 
Chapter  IX  §  6  and  see  also  A  86  =  B  118-19. 

3  A  86  =  B  118;  compare  A  94  =  B  126.  4  A  87  =  B  119. 


XVI  §  s]  THE  PROBLEM  317 

distinct  kinds,  according  as  they  originate  in  sensibility  or  in 
understanding.1  Space  and  time  belong  to  the  first  kind.  They 
are  forms  of  sensibility,  and  are  concepts  only  in  the  looser 
sense  of  the  word,2  being  pure  intuitions  rather  than  pure 
concepts.  The  categories,  as  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding, 
kelong  to  the  second  kind. 

The  difference  between  these  two  types  of  pure  concept 
must  not  be  allowed  to  obscure  their  common  character. 
Neither  type  is  the  result  of  generalisation  from  experience, 
and  the  relation  of  both  types  to  objects  is  completely  a  priori. 
Hence  in  neither  case  can  we  justify  them — as  we  can  justify 
such  a  concept  as  'swan* — by  showing  that  experience  supplies 
us  with  corresponding  objects.  We  have  to  show  that  all 
objects  must  be  spatial  and  temporal,  and  must  possess  categorial 
features.  This  necessity  can  never  be  established  by  an  appeal 
to  experience. 

Needless  to  say,  if  these  concepts  are  not  pure  concepts, 
Kant's  contention  falls  to  the  ground.  If,  on  the  other  hand, 
we  assume  them  to  be  pure  concepts,  Kant  is  certainly  right. 
Anyone  who  attempts  an  empirical  justification  (or  deduction) 
of  pure  concepts,  while  admitting  them  to  be  pure  concepts, 
shows  beyond  question  that  he  does  not  understand  what  a 
pure  concept  is.3 

§  5.  Psychological  Development  in  Time 

This  does  not  mean  that  an  empirical  or  psychological 
investigation  of  the  gradual  acquisition  of  these  and  other 
concepts  in  our  experience  is  either  impossible  or  undesirable. 
On  the  contrary,  it  is  of  the  greatest  service,  as  is  shown  by 
the  pioneer  work  of  Locke.4 

In  this  passage  again,   as  so   often — although   not  often 

1  A  85  -  B  118. 

2  This  looser  sense  is  very  often  used  by  Kant.  When  he  wants 
one  word  to  describe  space  and  time  and  the  categories  together,  he 
generally  calls  them  a  priori  concepts  (Begriffe)  rather  than  a  priori 
ideas  (Vorstellungen),  which  would  be  a  more  exact  description.  Even 
by  themselves  space  and  time  are  frequently  referred  to  as  concepts. 

3  A  87  -  B  119.  4A86  =  B  119. 


3i8          THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION      [XVI  §5 

enough  to  convince  his  critics — Kant  repudiates  the  view 
that  he  is  offering  an  account  of  the  development  of  our 
experience  in  time.1  He  distinguishes  clearly  and  correctly 
between  an  empirical  or  psychological  enquiry,  which  deals 
with  temporal  development,  and  a  transcendental  enquiry, 
which  does  not.  It  is  psychology  which  must  seek  in  experience 
the  occasioning  causes  which  lead  to  the  production  of  pure 
concepts;  and  it  is  sense-impressions  which  give  the  first 
inducement  or  stimulus  to  manifest2  our  whole  powers  of 
cognition  in  relation  to  these  sense-impressions,  and  so  to  bring 
about  experience. 

We  must  never  forget  that  'experience'  is  a  technical  term, 
and  involves  two  factors :  a  matter  given  to  sense,  and  a  form 
imposed  by  pure  intuition  on  the  one  hand  and  by  pure 
understanding  on  the  other.  It  is  only  when  we  receive  sense- 
impressions  that  pure  intuition  and  pure  thought  come  into 
play,  and  give  rise  to  space  and  time  and  the  categories. 
Without  both  matter  and  form  there  is  nothing  which  could 
be  called  human  experience. 

A  statement  so  clear  and  unqualified  at  the  very  beginning 
of  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  supported  as  it  is  by  a 
similar  statement  at  the  beginning  of  the  Analytic  of  Concepts,3 
ought  to  put  out  of  court,  once  and  for  all,  any  interpretation 
which  supposes  Kant  to  explain  how  we  begin  by  knowing 
space  and  time  and  the  categories,  and  then  proceed  to  build 
up  experience  by  their  means.  Sense-impressions,  space  and 
time,  and  the  categories  are  at  work  in  experience  from  the 
start,  but  it  is  only  gradually  that  we  disentangle  them  from 
one  another. 

It  is  both  perverse  and  unfair  to  insist  on  importing  psycho- 
logical interpretations  into  Kant,  and  then  to  condemn  him 
for  being  muddle-headed,  because  his  argument,  when  so 
interpreted,  is  absurd.4 

1  Compare  A  66  =  B  91  and  Chapter  III  §  3. 

2  A  86  =  B  118,  'erdffnen'.  3  A  66  -  B  91. 
4  It  may  be  objected  that  Kant's  doctrine  is  psychological  so  far 

as  it  ascribes  the  origin  of  space  and  time  to  sensibility  and  the  origin 
of  the  categories  to  thought.  If  we  choose  to  call  this  psychology, 


XVI  §6]  THE  PROBLEM  319 

§  6.  Necessity  for  a  Transcendental  Deduction 

We  now  come  to  Kant's  second  main  point.  We  have  seen 
that  if  there  is  to  be  any  justification  of  the  pure  concepts, 
it  must  be  a  transcendental  deduction,  and  not  an  empirical 
one.^Kant  has  now  to  show  that  such  a  deduction  is  indis- 
pensable.1 

The  necessity  for  a  transcendental  deduction  is  not  obvious 
in  the  case  of  space  and  time,  although  in  the  Aesthetic  such 
a  deduction  has  already  been  given.2  Space  and  time  were 
justified  or  deduced  as  a  priori  ideas,  because  we  traced  them 
to  their  roots  in  human  sensibility,  and  showed  thereby  that 
they  were  necessarily  valid  of  all  objects  given  to  sense,  and 
of  such  objects  alone.3 

Although  such  a  deduction  has  been  given,  the  need  for  it, 
Kant  insists,  is  not  obvious.  The  geometrician  does  not  require 
a  birth-certificate4  from  the  philosopher,  before  his  progeny 
can  be  regarded  as  legitimate.  On  the  contrary,  geometry, 
quite  independently  of  philosophy,  takes  its  own  sure  and 
certain  way,  and  gives  us  pure  a  priori  knowledge,  whose 
validity,  Kant  believes,  no  sensible  person  can  doubt. 

The  reason  for  the  certainty  of  geometry  we  have  already 
seen.  Geometry  is  grounded  on  the  pure  intuition  of  space, 
and  therefore  can  offer  us  immediate  evidence  or  certainty.5 
Furthermore,  in  geometrical  knowledge  objects  are  already 
given  a  priori*  in  intuition,  so  far  as  their  form  is  concerned.7 

it  is  certainly  not  empirical  psychology,  and  nothing  but  confusion 
can  arise  from  any  suggestion  that  it  is.  We  have  only  to  consider 
the  nature  of  the  argument  in  the  Aesthetic  and  in  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction  in  order  to  see  at  once  that  this  is  so. 

1  A  87  -  B  119. 

2  A  87  =  B  119-20.  Compare  Chapter  V§  2.  This  'transcendental 
deduction'  of  space  and  time  must  cover  the  whole  argument  of  the 
Aesthetic  including  the  'Conclusions'. 

3  A  87  =  B  119.  The  last  clause  is,  I  think,  implied  in  the  word 
'bestimmt*.  4  Compare  A  86  =  B  119. 

6  Compare  A  160  =  B  200,  and  Log.  EinL  III  and  IX  (IX  23  and  70). 

6  They  are  given  only  because  we  have  constructed  them ;  compare 
B  130  and  B  137-8. 

7  Compare  B  147  and  A  239-240  —  B  299. 


320        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVI  §  6 

Geometry  does  not  use  the  concept  of  space  beyond  the  world 
of  outer  sense ;  and  since  space  is  the  pure  form  of  outer  sense, 
geometrical  knowledge  must  manifestly  apply  to  objects  of 
outer  sense. 

The  categories  are  on  an  entirely  different  footing.  They 
are  not,  like  space  and  time,  obviously  related  to  objects. 
For  them  a  transcendental  deduction  is  absolutely  indispensable, 
and  it  is  because  of  them  that  we  are  forced  to  give  a  deduction 
of  space  and  time  as  well. 

In  applying  the  categories  to  objects  we  are  not  making  use 
of  predicates  which  are  derived  from  empirical  intuition  (as  are 
empirical  concepts)  or  from  pure  intuition  (as  are  the  concepts 
of  spatiality  and  temporality  and  all  mathematical  concepts). 
On  the  contrary,  we  are  making  use  of  predicates  derived  from 
pure  thought,  and  indeed  (if  we  assume  the  truth  of  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction)  derived  from  the  form  of  judgement 
itself.  Hence  we  cannot  find  an  object  for  them  in  what  is 
given  to  sensuous  experience,  as  we  could  if  they  were  empirical 
concepts ;  and  we  cannot  find  an  object  for  them  by  constructing 
it  a  priori  in  pure  intuition,  as  we  could  if  they  were  mathe- 
matical concepts.  Their  claim  is  to  apply  universally  to 
all  objects  without  any  reference  whatever  to  conditions  of 
sensibility.1 

The  difficulty  in  regard  to  the  categories  is  this.  On  the  one 
hand,  as  pure  categories,  they  would  seem  to  apply  necessarily 
to  all  objects  whatsoever  (including  things-in-themselves)  ;2  and 
on  the  other  hand,  when  we  look  for  objects  to  which  they  must 
apply,  we  can  at  first  sight  find  in  objects  (whether  given  in 
empirical  or  in  pure  intuition)  nothing  which  justifies  such 

1  A  88  =  B  1 20.  The  text  is  perhaps  corrupt,  but  the  general  sense 
is  plain.  The  doctrine  of  the  last  sentence  is  to  be  found  also  in  B  148; 
B  1 66  n. ;  B  305-6;  K.d.p.V.  (V  54);  and  in  many  other  places. 

2  This  claim  is  not  only  a  rationalist  assumption ;  it  is  involved 
in  the  very  nature  of  the  pure  categories  as  discovered  by  Kant. 
Compare  Adickes,  Kant  und  das  Ding  an  sichy  Abschn.  IV,  pp.  38-74 
— I  cannot,  however,  accept  all  his  conclusions.  Compare  also  Chapter  II 
§  4,  where  the  emptiness  of  thought  about  things-in-themselves  by 
means  of  the  pure  categories  is  explained. 


XVI  §6]  THE  PROBLEM  321 

application.1  Hence  suspicion  is  inevitably  aroused  as  to  the 
objective  validity  of  the  categories — do  they  apply  to  any 
objects  at  all?  Suspicion  is  also  aroused  as  to  the  limits  of 
their  employment2 — can  they  give  us  knowledge  beyond  the 
limits  of  the  sensible  world  ?  It  is  this  double  suspicion  which 
make?  a  transcendental  deduction  indispensable.  Without  such 
a  transcendental  deduction,  the  whole  procedure  of  philosophy 
is  blind;  it  gives  rise  to  manifold  aberrations,  and  ends  only 
in  the  ignorance  from  which  it  began.3 

When  suspicions  of  this  kind  are  once  aroused,  they  are 
inevitably  directed  also  to  space.4  If  we  can  seem  entitled  to 
apply  the  pure  category  beyond  the  limits  of  sensible  experience, 
why  should  we  not  be  entitled  to  do  the  same  with  our  idea 
of  space?  If  we  can  know  that  God  is  a  substance,  might  we 
not  also  know  that  God  is  a  spatial  substance  ?  Such  a  doctrine 
would  never  arise  in  the  development  of  geometry,  but  it 
might  be  put  forward  by  a  philosopher.5 

It  was  because  of  such  possibilities,  and  not  because  of  the 
need  for  justifying  geometry,  that  a  transcendental  deduction 
of  space  was  necessary.  The  negative  side  of  such  a  deduction 
is  as  important  as  the  positive.  By  showing  that  space  is  a  form 
of  sensibility  as  well  as  a  pure  intuition,  Kant  did  not  merely 
establish  the  objective  validity  of  geometrical  concepts ;  he  also 
set  the  limits  (the  world  of  outer  sense)  beyond  which  geo- 
metrical concepts  have  no  title  to  pass. 


1  Compare  A  137  =  B  176:  'Pure  concepts  of  the  understanding, 
being  quite  heterogeneous  from  empirical  intuitions,  and  indeed  from 
all  sensuous  intuitions,  can  never  be  met  with  in  any  intuition.'  See 
also  the  questions  of  Maimon  and  Kant's  answer  in  a  letter  to  Herz 
(XI  50  ff). 

a  Kant  could  not  have  said  this,  nor  what  follows,  if  he  had  still 
believed  that  categories  as  applied  to  things-in-themselves  could  give 
us  knowledge.  8  A  88  =  B  121. 

4  And  of  course  to  time,  but  Kant  is  concerned  primarily  with 
geometry. 

6  See  B  71, and  compare  Diss.  §  22  Scholion  (II 410).  This  supposition 
is  not  merely  fanciful,  as  may  be  seen  from  the  doctrines  of  Male- 
branche,  Spinoza,  and  Henry  More  (the  Cambridge  Platonist).

322        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVI  §  7 

§  7.  Difficulty  of  Deducing  the  Categories 

A  transcendental  deduction  of  the  categories  is  not  only 
more  necessary,  it  is  also  more  difficult,  than  a  transcendental 
deduction  of  space  and  time.1  This  is  the  third  main  point 
which  Kant  seeks  to  establish  in  §  13. 

In  the  case  of  space  and  time  it  was  easy  to  show,  botK  that 
they  are  known  a  priori  in  themselves,  and  also  that  they 
apply  necessarily  to  objects.2  In  this  way,  Kant  adds,  we  showed 
how  a  synthetic  knowledge  of  objects  was  possible  indepen- 
dently of  experience.3  A  synthesis  in  space  and  time  has 
objective  validity,  because  space  and  time  are  pure  intuitions 
whose  content  is  the  form  of  intuition.  Since  an  object  can 
appear,  or  be  an  object  of  empirical  intuition,  only  under 
these  forms,  space  and  time  contain  in  themselves  a  priori 
the  condition  of  the  possibility  of  objects  as  appearances,  and 
a  synthesis  of  space  and  time  must  govern  the  objects  as 
appearances* 

In  the  case  of  the  categories  no  easy  deduction  is  possible, 
and  Kant  insists  that  we  must  recognise  the  inevitable  difficulty 
of  the  argument.  We  must  expect  a  certain  obscurity  in  matters 
by  their  very  nature  so  deeply  veiled,  and  we  must  not  become 
impatient  if  too  much  time  seems  to  be  spent  in  getting  rid 
of  obstacles.5  The  absolute  necessity  of  struggling  with  the 
argument  to  the  end  is  shown  by  the  fact  that  we  must  either 
complete  the  Critical  enquiry,  or  else  give  up  all  claims  to 
make  judgements  of  pure  reason  in  regard  to  what  lies  beyond 
the  limits  of  possible  experience. 

1  A  88  =  B  121  and  A  89  =  B  122. 

2  Here  Kant  distinguishes  clearly  the  two  senses  in  which  space 
and  time  are  a  priori. 

8  In  the  Aesthetic  Kant  ignores  imaginative  synthesis,  but  he  does 
recognise  that  the  judgements  of  mathematics  are  synthetic  a  priori 
judgements. 

4  Space  and  time  contain  the  conditions  under  which  an  object  is 
given  as  an  appearance;  but  when  we  carry  our  analysis  further — 
compare  A  92  =  B  125 — we  shall  find  that  it  is  given  only  as  an 
appearance,  and  that  to  know  an  object  proper,  we  require  thought 
as  well  as  intuition. 

6  I  take  this  as  a  reference  to  the  provisional  exposition  of  Section  2. 


XVI  §  8]  THE  PROBLEM  323 

It  should  hardly  be  necessary  to  add  that  Kant  is  not  here 
proposing  to  show  that  the  application  of  the  categories 
beyond  experience  will  give  us  knowledge.  He  is  saying  to 
the  rationalists  that,  once  the  difficulty  of  justifying  the  use 
of  the  categories  has  been  pointed  out,  they  have  no  right 
to  employ  such  categories  beyond  experience,  as  they  are  so 
Yond  of  doing,  unless  and  until  there  is  a  successful  deduction 
or  justification  of  the  use  of  the  categories.  The  result  of  that 
deduction  is,  in  the  statement  of  the  problem,1  properly 
treated  as  an  open  question.  The  fact  that  Kant  does  so  treat 
it  gives  not  the  slightest  ground  for  supposing  that,  at  the 
time  the  passage  was  written,  he  was  unaware  of  what  the 
consequences  of  the  deduction  would  be.  His  statement  is 
perfectly  compatible  with  the  belief  that  when  he  proves  the 
necessary  application  of  the  categories  to  objects  of  sense, 
he  will  also  prove  that  we  cannot  attain  knowledge  by  applying 
them  to  anything  else.2  Any  other  interpretation  of  his  statement 
is  not  only  incompatible  with  everything  he  says  elsewhere; 
it  is  also  incompatible  with  what  he  says  in  this  very  section, 
and  even  in  this  paragraph  itself,  in  regard  to  a  transcendental 
deduction  of  space  and  time.3 

The  supposition  that  Kant  has  here  inserted  a  passage  in 
which  a  transcendental  deduction  justifies  knowledge  of  things- 
in-themselves4  is  not  only  unnecessary,  but,  I  venture  to  suggest, 
unthinkable. 

§  8.  Reasons  for  this  Difficulty 

What  is  the  source  of  the  special  difficulty  which  belongs 
to  the  Transcendental  Deduction  of  the  Categories  ? 

1  It  is  similarly  treated  in  the  more  general  statement  of  the  problem 
in  B  22 :  'It  must  be  possible  either  to  extend  our  reason  with  certainty 
or  to  set  it  sure  and  determinate  limits.' 

2  Compare  Chapter  II  §  4.  This  of  course  does  not  modify  Kant's 
view  that  we  must  think  things-in-themselves  by  means  of  the  pure 
categories,  although  we  can  never  know  them. 

3  He  can  state  what  the  consequence  of  a  transcendental  deduction 
of  space  and  time  is,  because  this  deduction  has  already  been  given. 

4  Compare  Kemp  Smith,  Commentary,  pp.  220-1. 


324       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION      [XVI  §  8 

The  difficulty  is  sufficiently  obvious,  and  arises  from  the 
fact  that,  on  Kant's  view,  the  categories  have  their  origin  in 
the  understanding.  This  lies  at  the  root  of  Kant's  whole 
philosophy  and  is  the  reason  why  the  pure  categories  must 
be  schematised.1  The  categories  are  not,  like  space  and  time, 
conditions  or  forms  under  which  objects  are  given  in  intuition.2 
Hence  objects  can  appear  to  us  (or  be  given  to  us)  without 
being  necessarily  related  to  the  forms  of  the  understanding;3 
and  consequently  the  understanding  would  seem4  not  to 
contain  the  a  priori  conditions  of  objects. 

This  difficulty  does  not  arise  in  regard  to  space  and  time. 
Since  objects  cannot  be  known  unless  they  are  given  to  sense, 
they  must  conform  to  the  formal  conditions  of  sensibility. 
It  is  not  so  easy  to  see  why  they  should  conform  to  the  con- 
ditions which  understanding  requires  for  the  synthetic  unity 
of  thought.5  Appearances6  given  under  the  forms  of  sense 
might  be  so  constituted  as  not  to  accord  with  the  forms  of 

1  Compare  A  137  =  B  176  if. 

2  A  89  =  B  122.  This  is  always  Kant's  view;  compare  B  159-60 
and  also  B  136-7. 

3  This  might  be  taken  as  the  inference  which  is  naturally,  but 
mistakenly,  drawn  by  common  sense.  Such  would,  I  think,  be  the 
obvious  explanation,  if  Kant  had  said  'objects  might  appear*  instead 
of  'objects  can  appear*  (kdnnten  instead  of  ktinneri) — as  he  does  in 
a  parallel  passage  (A  90  =  B  123),  where  he  says  *  Appearances  might 
be  so  constituted  that  the  understanding  would  find  them  to  be  not 
in  accordance  with  the  conditions  of  its  unity*,  a  supposition  which 
it  is  the  business  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  to  refute.  Even 
as  it  is,  this  seems  to  me  a  possible  explanation,  although  the  sentence 
is  better  taken  as  expressing  Kant*s  own  view,  if  we  stress  the  word 
'appear'  and  equate  it  with  'be  given',  as  I  have  done,  and  as  Kant 
himself  does  expressly  in  A  93  =  B  125.  In  any  case  I  see  no  reason  to 
believe  that  Kant  here  wishes  to  assert  as  his  own  view  the  doctrine 
that  objects  in  the  full  sense  can  appear  to  us  apart  from  thought. 

4  The  imperfect  subjunctive  'enthielte*  suggests,  I  think,  that  Kant 
is  not  committing  himself  to  this  supposed  consequence.  The  under- 
standing does  not  contain  the  conditions  under  which  objects  are 
given,  but  it  does  contain  the  conditions  under  which  objects  are 
thought. 

6  A  90  =  B  123.  Note  that  the  unity  of  thought  is  here  synthetic. 
8  If  Kant  had  said  'appearances*  instead  of  'objects'  in  A  89  =  B  122, 
the  difficulties  of  his  statement  would  disappear. 


XVI  §  8]  THE  PROBLEM  325 

thought ;  for  appearances  can  be  given  in  intuition  independently 
of  these  forms.1  Intuition  qud  intuition  is  entirely  independent 
of  the  form  of  thought,2  and  so  appearances  would  present 
objects3  to  our  intuition,  even  if,  for  example,  nothing  in  the 
succession  of  appearances  corresponded  to  the  category  of 
cause  and  effect. 

If  we  are  not  misled  by  the  ambiguity  of  the  word  'object', 
this  is  a  clear  statement  of  the  problem  which  we  have  to 
solve.  We  must  remember  that  the  categories  spoken  of  are 
pure  categories.  We  must  also  remember  that  at  this  stage  of 
the  argument  Kant  is  entitled  to  speak  of  the  object — as  he 
does  in  the  Aesthetic4 — on  the  level  of  common  sense.  The 
object  may  be  taken  to  be  a  body,  such  as  a  chair.  It  is  given 
to  us  in  sense,  and  so  must  be  spatial  and  temporal;  but  there 
is  as  yet  no  obvious  reason  why  it  should  be  subject  to  the 
categories,  which,  we  have  argued,  originate  in  the  under- 
standing.6 When  we  carry  our  analysis  further,  we  shall  find 

1  A  90  =  B  122.  Compare  B  145:  'The  manifold  to  be  intuited 
must  be  given  prior  to  the  synthesis  of  the  understanding  and 
independently  of  it.* 

2  A  91   =  B  123.  Compare  B  132:  'The  idea  which  can  be  given 
prior  to  all  thought  is  called  intuition.'  I  take  Kant's  use  of  'prior* 
to  imply  logical,  not  temporal,  priority. 

8  A  90-1  =  B  123.  The  appearances  would  however,  as  Kant 
has  just  said,  be  without  unity,  so  that  the  presented  objects  would 
not  be  objects  in  the  full  sense.  4  Compare  Chapter  IV  §  2. 

5  The  origin  of  the  categories  is  the  main  burden  of  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction,  whose  limitations  are  plainly  indicated  by  this  preface 
to  the  Transcendental  Deduction;  compare  Chapter  XIV  §  9.  Any 
difficulty  that  arises  here  is  due  to  the  fact  that  Kant  has  already, 
in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction,  given  some  indications — in  my 
exposition  I  have  made  these  indications  even  more  explicit — of 
what  his  argument  in  regard  to  objects  is  going  to  be.  Apart  from  this, 
the  difficulties  and  objections  commonly  raised  seem  to  me  to  arise 
mainly  from  considering  this  passage  apart  from  its  context.  No 
doubt  Kant  would  have  made  it  easier  for  the  reader,  if  he  had  said 
'You  naturally  assume  at  this  stage  that  the  complete  account  of  objects 
— in  the  full  meaning — is  simply  that  they  are  given  to  sense ;  and  this 
is  not  the  case,  as  I  am  about  to  show'.  But  it  is  one  thing  to  admit 
that  Kant  does  not  give  the  reader  all  the  help  he  might,  and  quite 
another  thing  to  say  that  he  is  using  old  notes  which  flatly  contradict 
his  real  doctrine. 


3a6        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XVI  §  9 

that  although  every  determinate  object  must  be  given  to 
sense  (or  be  capable  of  being  given  to  sense),  nevertheless  the 
object  as  given  to  sense  apart  from  thought  is  an  object  only 
as  appearance**  it  is  the  indeterminate  as  opposed  to  the 
determinate  object.2  If  we  are  to  know  a  determinate  object, 
or  an  object  in  the  full  and  proper  sense  of  the  word,  we  require 
thought  as  well  as  intuition;  and  consequently  every  object 
of  knowledge  must  fall  under  the  forms  of  thought,  and  so 
under  the  categories.3  Apart  from  the  categories  we  have 
intuition  bereft  of  thought,  but  never  knowledge  of  objects.4 
This,  however,  is  Kant's  solution,  and  not  his  problem. 

§  9.  Illustration  of  the  Difficulty 

Kant's  difficulty  may  be  made  clearer  by  an  illustration. 
Let  us  suppose  that  the  hypothetical  form  of  judgement  is 
one  of  the  pure  forms  of  thought  under  which  it  is  claimed 
that  every  matter  judged  must  fall.  This  form  is  a  clue  to  the 
category  of  cause  and  effect,  which  at  the  present  stage  should 

1  A  92   =   B   125.   In  A   124  (supposed  by  Vaihinger  to  be  late) 
Kant  says  that  sensibility,  when  not  connected  with  understanding 
by  means  of  the  function  of  imagination,  would  give  us  appearances, 
but  not  objects  of  empirical  knowledge,  and  consequently  would  not 
give  us  experience. 

2  The   indeterminate   object   of  an   empirical  intuition   is   called 
'appearance';  see  A  20  =  B  34.  The  category  determines  the  object 
a  prioriy  if  only  through  the  category  is  it  possible  to  know  anything 
as  an  object \  see  A  92  =  B  125.  The  indeterminate  object  may  be 
said  to  be  the  matter  given  to  sense,  and  it  is  determined  by  being 
subjected  to  the  forms  of  combination  thought  in  the  categories.  A 
determinate  object  must  have   an   (intellectual)  form  imposed   by 
thought  as  well  as  a  matter  given  under  the  forms  of  sensibility; 
see  for  example  A  129-30  and  B  164. 

It  may  be  objected  that  the  'object  in  general'  thought  by  means 
of  the  categories  is  also  indeterminate  apart  from  sense.  With  this 
Kant  would  agree.  Apart  from  the  condition  of  sensuous  intuition  the 
categories  have  no  relation  to  any  determinate  object  (A  246).  Intuitions 
apart  from  concepts,  and  concepts  apart  from  intuitions,  are  alike  ideas 
which  we  cannot  relate  to  any  determinate  object  (A  258  =  B  314). 

8  How  it  can,  and  must,  do  so,  is  explained  in  the  subjective  side 
of  the  Transcendental  Deduction. 

*  'Knowledge*  and  'object1  are  here  used  in  the  strict  sense. 


XVI  §  IQ]  THE  PROBLEM  327 

strictly  be  regarded  as  having  no  reference  to  time.  All  that 
the  hypothetical  form  suggests  is  that  whatever  object  be 
given  to  us  we  should  be  able  to  judge  'If  A,  then  B'.  That 
is  to  say,  it  demands  that  any  given  A  should  be  such  that 
something  different,  namely  B,  must  necessarily  and  universally 
have  its  ground  in  A. 

Such,  according  to  Kant,  is  the  demand  of  pure  thought, 
but  we  have  obviously  no  right  to  assume  without  examination 
that  in  given  appearances  such  a  demand  must  be  satisfied. 
Given  appearances  might  conceivably  be  so  constituted  as  to 
offer  us  nothing  corresponding  to  this  necessary  form. 

If  there  is  to  be  an  object  corresponding  to  the  category 
of  cause  and  effect,  there  must  be  present  in  the  series  of  given 
appearances  something  which  will  correspond  to  the  category.1 
That  something  will  turn  out  later  to  be  necessary  succession.2 
Apart  from  this  the  category  has  no  reference  to  time,  and  is 
indeed  'empty,  null,  and  meaningless'.3 

The  difficulty  of  proving  a  necessary  succession  of  appearances 
in  time  as  a  correlate  to  the  pure  category  is  one  which  Kant 
has  not  exaggerated.  Many  philosophers  would  regard  such 
a  proof  as  not  only  difficult,  but  impossible. 

§  10.  Appeal  to  Experience  is  Useless 

We  cannot  evade  the  necessity  of  so  difficult  an  investigation 
by  saying  that  experience  continually  gives  us  examples  of 
regular  succession  in  phenomena;  and  that  consequently  we 
can  acquire  the  concept  of  cause  and  effect  by  abstraction, 
and  can  at  the  same  time  show  its  objective  validity,  just  as 
we  can  show  the  objective  validity  of  any  empirical  concept. 
For  Kant,  and  for  us  all,  causation  must  involve  strict  univer- 
sality and  necessity.  It  is  not  enough  that  the  effect  should 
usually  follow  upon  the  cause ;  it  must  be  posited  through  the 
cause  and  result  from  it.  If,  all  other  circumstances  being  the 

1 A  90  =  B  123 

a  A  144  =  B  183;  compare  Chapter  XXXIII  §  4. 
8  This  means  merely  that  we  cannot  indicate  any  object  to  which 
it  refers. 


328      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVI  §11 

same,  the  cause  A  fails,  even  once,  to  produce  the  effect  B, 
then  it  is  not  the  cause  of  B  at  all.  Without  necessity  there  is 
no  causation,  and  to  maintain  that  the  category  of  cause  and 
effect  is  due  merely  to  empirical  generalisation  is  to  assert — 
if  we  think  clearly — that  it  is  a  phantom  of  the  mind  which 
ought  to  be  abandoned  altogether.1 

§  ii.  The  Patchwork  Theory 

It  is  not  my  purpose  to  criticise  the  *  patchwork*  theory  in 
detail — I  have  done  so  elsewhere.2  The  best  refutation  of  this 
doctrine  is  to  be  found  in  an  exposition  which  shows  Kant's 
arguments  to  be  intelligible  and  consistent.  Such  an  exposition 
of  §  13  I  believe  that  I  have  now  given.  I  have  also  been  careful 
to  note  parallels  in  the  second  edition  to  the  statements  which 
are  condemned  as  pre-Critical  in  the  first  edition.  These 
parallels  are  ignored  by  the  exponents  of  the  patchwork  theory, 
nor  have  I  yet  seen  any  attempt  to  prove  that  in  the  second 
edition  also  Kant  filled  out  his  argument  by  notes  belonging 
to  a  pre-Critical  stage  of  thought. 

The  subsection  with  which  we  have  now  dealt  is,  however, 
so  straightforward  and  clear,  in  comparison  with  most  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction,  that  it  is  instructive  to  observe 
some  of  the  grounds  upon  which  it  has  been  condemned. 
Such  condemnation,  while  applying  to  the  whole,  is  concen- 
trated on  those  paragraphs  which  are  concerned  with  the  special 
difficulty  of  a  transcendental  deduction  of  the  categories. 

One  of  Vaihinger's  reasons  for  regarding  the  passage  as 
early  is  the  negative  one  that  imagination  is  not  mentioned.3 
Imagination,  however,  belongs  to  the  solution,  and  to  the 
solution  on  its  subjective  side;  what  Kant  is  stating  is  the 
problem. 

Another  reason  is  that  Kant  supposes  the  categories  to  be 
unnecessary  for  objects  of  intuition.4  Vaihinger  objects  particu-

larly1  to  the  statement  that  the  categories  do  not  represent 
the  conditions  under  which  objects  are  given  in  intuition.2 
It  is  astonishing  that  he  should  be  blind  to  the  fact  that  in 
this  statement  the  emphasis  is  on  the  word  'given'. 

His  further  objection  that  the  categories  are  supposed  to 
gpply  to  things-in-themselves  has  already  been  sufficiently 
discussed,  and  shown  to  be  groundless. 

There  is  one  other  point  on  which  he  lays  great  stress. 
The  objective  validity  of  the  categories  is  discussed  in  separation 
from  the  question  of  how  sensuous  intuitions  can  give  us  know- 
ledge of  (determinate)  objects.3  Yet  for  the  Critical  Philosophy 
these  questions  are  closely  connected. 

His  contention  is  true,  but  the  explanation  is  very  simple. 
The  problem  which  Kant  is  stating  is  how  the  categories  can 
be  valid  of  objects  given  to  sense.  The  solution  of  the  problem 
is  that  the  categories  must  be  valid  of  objects  given  to  sense, 
because  unless  the  given  intuitions  are  thought  under  the 
categories,  they  would  not  refer  to  a  determinate  object  at  all. 
It  is  peculiarly  unfair  to  Kant  to  argue  that  he  is  confused, 
because  he  makes  a  clear  distinction  between  his  problem  and 
its  solution.  This  is  one  of  the  many  cases  in  which  Kant  is 
blamed  because  he  does  not  write  the  whole  of  his  philosophy 
on  every  page. 

There  could  be  no  better  illustration  of  the  perverseness 
of  the  whole  patchwork  theory.  I  do  not  think  it  unfair  to  add 
that  if  the  exponents  of  this  theory  can  make  such  a  mess  of 
a  passage  which  is  relatively  simple,  we  can  have  little  confidence 
in  their  guidance  when  we  come  to  passages  which  are  really 
difficult. 

§  12.  Intuition  and  Understanding 

Professor  Kemp  Smith4  not  only  accepts  Vaihinger's  con- 
clusions, but  endeavours  to  support  them  by  a  somewhat

VOL.  I  L* 


330      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION       [XVI  §  12 

ambiguous  doctrine  of  his  own,  which  I  doubt  if  even  Vaihinger 
would  have  accepted.1  He  regards  as  pre-Critical  Kant's  asser- 
tion that  *  representations  can  be  consciously  apprehended 
independently  of  all  relation  to  the  faculty  of  understanding';2 
and  he  apparently  believes  the  Critical  Philosophy  to  maintain 
that  'save  in  and  through  a  priori  concepts  no  representations, 
can  exist  for  consciousness'.3 

The  evidence  for  this  view  is  said  to  appear  in  §  14  and  in 
the  first  four  paragraphs  of  Section  2;  and  corroboration  is 
found  in  later  passages,*  where  the  wording  is,  however, 
admitted  to  be  not  altogether  unambiguous. 

The  passages  to  which  Mr.  Kemp  Smith  appeals  show 
clearly  enough  that  for  Kant  there  can  be  no  knowledge  or 
experience  of  objects — in  the  strict  sense — apart  from  the 
categories.  To  say  this  is,  however,  a  very  different  thing 
from  saying  that  no  representations  can  exist  for  consciousness 
apart  from  the  categories. 

For  Kant  knowledge  or  experience  of  objects  requires  both 
intuition  (with  its  forms)  and  thought  (with  its  categories). 
There  is  in  this,  so  far,  nothing  to  imply  that  intuition  could 
not  exist  in  consciousness  apart  from  thought,  and  so  apart  from 
the  categories.  Perhaps  Mr.  Kemp  Smith  means  that  in 
distinctively  human  consciousness  such  a  divorce,  on  Kant's 
view,  never  takes  place;  but  I  cannot  see  that  the  passages 
to  which  he  appeals  deny  the  possibility  of  such  a  divorce; 
nor  do  I  admit  that  Kant  must  necessarily  be  interpreted  as 
asserting  the  possibility  of  such  a  divorce  in  the  passages 
which  are  said  to  be  pre-Critical.5

appear  to  us  without  any  necessary  relation  to  the  forms  of  the 
understanding*  may  mean  only  that  so  far  as  they  appear  (or  are 
given  to  sense),  this  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  forms  of  thought — 


XVI  §  12]  THE  PROBLEM  331 

As  I  understand  Kant,  experience,  as  knowledge  of  deter- 
minate objects,  involves  a  matter  given  to  sense,  and  a  form 
imposed  both  by  sensibility  and  by  understanding.  The  matter 
is  always  given  under  the  forms  of  sensibility,  and  is  never 
given  under  the  forms  of  understanding.  This  does  not  mean 
that  in  experience  when  we  see,  for  example,  a  red  billiard-ball, 
we  first  of  all  see  the  colour  red,  and  then  proceed  to  bring 
it  under  the  category  of  substance  and  attribute.  There  is  no 
temporal  succession  of  this  kind  in  ordinary  human  experience ; 
but  nevertheless  it  is  due  to  our  sensibility  that  we  see  the 
red  colour,  and  it  is  due  to  our  understanding  that  we  see 
it  as  the  colour  of  a  thing  or  object,  namely  a  billiard-ball. 

In  this  case  the  intuition,  or  sensation,  given  to  sense  apart 
from  thought  is  separated  from  experience  by  an  act  of  analysis, 
and  does  not  exist  by  itself  in  consciousness  apart  from  thought 
of  an  object.  But  although  in  ordinary  experience  we  do  not  first 
receive  an  intuition,  and  then  think  that  it  is  the  intuition  of  an 
object,  it  does  not  follow  that  it  is  impossible  to  have  conscious 
intuitions  without  thinking  that  they  are  intuitions  of  an  object. 

Whether  intuitions  can  exist  in  human  consciousness 
without  being  referred  to  an  object  seems  to  me  a  matter  for 
empirical  psychology;  and  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  say  on 
a  priori  grounds  that  they  cannot  be  found,  for  example,  in 
the  penumbra  of  consciousness,  or  in  falling  asleep  and  waking, 
or  again  in  the  earliest  consciousness  of  an  infant.  What  Kant's 
view  on  this  subject  was  I  do  not  know;1  and  I  cannot  see 

a  doctrine  which,  I  believe,  Kant  always  holds.  If  we  insist  on 
interpreting  it  otherwise,  then  it  may  be  taken  as  the  common-sense 
inference  which  Kant  recognises  he  must  meet  in  the  Transcendental 
Deduction. 

1  Kant's  distinction  of  'judgements  of  perception'  and  'judgements 
of  experience'  in  the  Prolegomena,  §  18  (IV  298) — compare  B  142 — 
suggests  strongly  that  he  believed  intuitions  could  be  present  in 
consciousness  without  being  referred  to  objects  by  means  of  the 
categories;  but  this  may  be  dismissed  as  an  afterthought  and  not 
a  very  happy  one.  A  similar  view  is  perhaps  involved  in  his  treatment 
of  dreams — see  B  278 ;  A  201-2  ==  B  246-7 ;  A  376 ;  A  492  =  B  520-1 ; 
Prol.  §  13  Anmerk.  Ill  (IV  290) — while  A  123-4  and  other  passages 
might  be  quoted  in  support  of  Kemp  Smith's  contention ;  but  I  do 
not  find  the  evidence  conclusive  on  either  side. 


332       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XVI  §  13 

that  it  is  of  any  importance  for  the  interpretation  of  the 
Critical  Philosophy.  It  certainly  does  not  affect  Kant's  doctrine 
that  the  categories  are  the  conditions  under  which  an  object 
is  thought,  and  are  not  the  conditions  under  which  an  object 
is  given. 

§  13.  Animal  Consciousness 

Mr.  Kemp  Smith's  doctrine  is  ambiguously  expressed,  but 
I  suspect  him  of  holding  that  Kant  believed  the  categories 
to  be  conditions  of  consciousness  as  such.1  This  is  borne  out 
by  his  identification  of  'consciousness*  with  'awareness'2  and 
his  assertion  that  'all  awareness,  no  matter  how  rudimentary 
or  apparently  simple,  is  an  act  of  judgement  and  therefore 
involves  the  relational  categories'.3  If  this  is  accepted,  it  would 
•follow  that  animals — since,  according  to  Kant,  they  do  not 
employ  categories  or  even  concepts — must  be  without  con- 
sciousness ;  and  such  is  the  inference  which  Mr.  Kemp  Smith 
actually  draws.4 

He  supports  his  contention  by  reference  to  two  passages. 
In  the  first5  animals  are  said  to  possess  'apprehensio  bruta 
without  consciousness'.6  In  this  passage,  as  so  often,7  con- 

1  Compare  Commentary,  p.  222 :  'Relation  to  an  object  is  constituted 
by  the  categories,  and  is  necessary  in  reference  to  sense-presentations, 
because  only  thereby  is  consciousness  of  any  kind  possible  at  all'. 

2  E.g.  p.  xxxix.  3  P.  xlii. 

4  P.  xlix:  Animals  'must  also  be  denied  anything  analogous  to  what 
we  must  signify  by  the  term  consciousness*.  Yet  he  can  also  speak 
— see  p.  1 — as  if  animal  consciousness  was  distinguished  from  human 
consciousness   by   involving  associative — as   opposed   to   logical   or 
reflective — thinking.

6  'ohne  Bewusstsein.' 

7  Mellin  (Wo'rterbuch,  I,  p.  687)  actually  speaks  as  if  ' Bewusstsein* 
for  Kant  meant  only  self-consciousness  (conscientia,  apperceptio).  This 
is  a  common  usage  of    the  time.   Baumgarten,  Metaphysica  §  535 
(XV  13),  identifies  'conscientia  strictius  dicta'  with  inner  sense ;  compare 
G.  F.  Meier,  Auszug  §  13.  In  M.A.d.N.  (IV  542)  Kant  says  that  the 
power  of  consciousness  is  apperception;  in  Log.  V  (IX  33)  that  con- 
sciousness, strictly  speaking,  is  an  idea  that  another  idea  is  in  me; 
and  in  B  158  consciousness  is  equated  with  the  fact  that  'I  think 
myself*. 


XVI  §  1 3]  THE  PROBLEM  333 

sciousness  (Bewusstseiri)  is  used  by  Kant  to  mean  'self- 
consciousness*  or  'apperception',  as  is,  I  think,  suggested  by 
the  passage  itself.1  The  doctrine  is  made  quite  clear  by  the 
second  passage  on  which  Mr.  Kemp  Smith  relies.2  There 
Kant  maintains  that  if  it  can  be  shown  that  our  knowledge 
or  experience  of  things  is  possible  only  under  certain  conditions 
(the  forms  of  sensibility  and  categories  of  the  understanding), 
then  apart  from  these  conditions  sense-data  would  not  represent 
objects,  nor  would  they  attain  to  that  unity  of  consciousness 
which  is  necessary  for  knowledge  of  self?  He  adds:  'I  should 
not  be  able  to  know  that  I4  have  them,  and  they  would  therefore 
be  for  me,  as  a  being  possessed  of  knowledge,  absolutely 
nothing.6  They  might  still  (if  I  conceive  myself  as  an  animal) 
be  able  to  carry  on  with  regularity  their  play  in  me  (a  being 
unconscious  of  my  own  existence)  as  ideas  bound  together  by 
empirical  laws  of  association  and  so  having  influence  upon 
feeling  and  desire — it  being  assumed  that  I  should  be  conscious 
of  each  individual  idea  but  not  of  its  relation  to  the  unity  of  the 
representation  of  the  object  by  means  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  its 
apperception — but  I  should  not  thereby  be  able  to  know  any- 
thing, not  even  to  know  this  state  of  myself*.6 

Mr.  Kemp  Smith  has  omitted  the  parenthesis  which  I  have 
italicised.  His  ground  for  doing  so  is  that  Kant  'has  not 
developed  a  terminology  really  adequate  to  the  statement  of 
his  meaning*.  The  parenthesis,  on  the  contrary,  is  absolutely 
essential  to  Kant's  meaning.  He  is  saying  that  if  I  were  an 

1  'Apprehensio  bruta*  is  opposed  to  ' apperceptio* '. 

2  Letter  to  Herz  (XI  52),  quoted  in   Kemp  Smith,  Commentary, 
pp.  xlix-1. 

3  For  Kant  knowledge  of  objects  and  knowledge  of  self  are  correlative 
terms — each  implies  the  other. 

4  I  take  the  stress  to  be  on  the  word  T.  The  words  'for  me*  in  the 
next  clause  are  italicised  by  Kant. 

5  The  meaning  of  this  has  been  already  explained  in  the  letter  itself. 
*If  intuitions  did  not  conform  to  the  conditions  of  experience,  they 
would  be  for  us  nothing ;  that  is,  they  would  not  be  objects  of  knowledge, 
neither  of  self-knowledge  nor  of  knowledge  of  other  things.' 

8 1  take  this  to  mean  that  I  should  neither  know  any  object  thereby, 
nor  should  I  know  the  given  idea  as  a  state  of  myself. 


334      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XVI  §  13 

animal,  or  if  the  animal  part  of  me  existed  in  separation,  then 
I  might  be  conscious  of  separate  given  ideas,  but  I  should  not 
be  conscious  of  these  ideas  either  as  states  of  myself  or  as 
referring  to  objects.  The  categories,  in  short,  are  the  conditions 
of  knowledge  both  of  self  and  of  objects,  but  they  are  not  the 
conditions  of  consciousness. 

So  far  as  I  can  discover,  Kant  never  deviates  from  this 
general  doctrine.  As  regards  the  consciousness  of  animals, 
although  what  he  says  should  be  taken  as  obiter  dicta,  there 
are  many  passages  where  he  affirms  his  belief  that  animals  are 
conscious,  although  not  self-conscious ;  and  I  know  none  where 
this  is  denied.  For  example,  in  his  lectures  on  Logic,1  Kant 
distinguishes  different  grades  of  what  may  be  called,  in  the 
widest  sense,  'cognition'.  The  first  grade  is  idea  or  represen- 
tation;2 the  second  is  idea  conjoined  with  consciousness, 
which  is  sense-perception?  the  third  is  acquaintance*  the 
representation  of  something  in  comparison  with  other  things 
in  regard  to  both  identity  and  difference ;  the  fourth  is  know- 
ledge  f  that  is,  acquaintance  with  something  accompanied  by 
what  Kant  calls  'consciousness',  in  the  sense,  I  take  it,  of 
self-consciousness.  Above  these  there  is  understanding*  in- 
sight? and  comprehension*  but  these  we  can  neglect.  The  only 
point  with  which  we  are  here  concerned  is  that  animals,  attain 
to  the  third  degree  of  cognition;  they  have  acquaintance  with 
objects,  though  they  do  not  know  them.9 

1  Log.  Einl.  VIII  (IX  64-5);  compare  A  320  =  B  376-7. 

2  ssich  etwas  vorstellenS  This,  I  believe,  need  not  be  C9nscious. 

8  'wahrnekmen*  or  'percipere'.  4  'kennen*  or  'noscere*. 

5  'erkennen'  or  ' cognoscere1 '. 

6  'verstehen*  or  'intelligere*.   This  seems  to  be  identified  here  with 
abstract  conception.  7  'einsehen*  or  'perspicere*. 

8  'begreifen*  or  ' comprehendere* '.  The  last  two  grades  are  here  con- 
nected with  reason;  see  also  Metaphysik,  p.  29. 

9  It  is  unnecessary  here  to  elaborate  this  distinction.  A  dog  has 
acquaintance  with,  for  example,  meat  and  bread,  for  he  is  differently 
affected  by  them.  He  distinguishes  between  the  two  things,  but  he 
does  not  know  wherein  the  differences  consist.  He  may,  for  example, 
have  in  smell  a  clear  idea  of  the  'mark*  of  meat,  but  he  does  not 
know  that  this  is  a  mark  of  meat ;  he  does  not,  in  short,  possess  concepts, 


XVI  §  1 3]  THE  PROBLEM  335 

It  seems  to  me  that  Kant,  although  he  is  never  dogmatic 
on  the  subject,  believed  animals  to  possess,  not  only  con- 
sciousness, but  a  relatively  high  grade  of  consciousness.  And 
I  can  see  no  adequate  reason  either  for  maintaining  that  Kant 
held  consciousness  as  such  to  be  inseparable  from  the  categories 
or  fgr  condemning  §  13  on  such  a  ground. 

and  still  less  does  he  possess  categories.  Compare  Die  falsche  Spitz- 
findigkeit,  §  6  (II  59-60),  where  Kant  also  implies — what  is  his  usual 
doctrine — that  animals  possess  outer,  but  not  inner,  sense.  Here  as 
always  concepts  and  judgements  imply  self-consciousness,  since  they 
imply  a  distinction  between  the  self  and  the  object.  Compare  Nachlass 
411  (XV  166):  *  Animals  have  apprehensions  but  not  apperceptions; 
hence  they  cannot  make  their  ideas  universal*.  Other  references  are 
K.d.U.  §  90  (V  464  n.);  Anthr.  Ergdnzungen  aus  d.  Handschrift,  141, 7 
(VII  395)  and  Fortschritte  d.  Metaphysik  (Phil.  Bib.  46c,  p.  95).  The 
clearest  account  I  have  found  is  in  Kant's  lectures  on  Metaphysics; 
see  Metaphysik,  pp.  129-30,  and  compare  p.  119.  Animals  have  also 
pleasure  and  pain,  and  this  means  that  they  are  active,  not  mechanically, 
but  in  accordance  with  ideas;  see  Metaphysik,  p.  100,  and  compare 
pp.  102  and  106.  In  K.d.U.  Erste  Einleitung  V  (Phil.  Bib.  39b,  p.  18) 
animals  are  even  credited  with  'instinctive  reflexion'. 


CHAPTER    XVII 
THE  METHOD   OF   SOLUTION 

§  i .  The  Copernican  Revolution 

In  stating  his  problem  Kant  has  carefully  excluded  any 
reference  to  his  Critical  solution.  He  has  assumed  only  that 
we  possess  certain  a  priori  categories  which  claim  to  apply 
necessarily  and  universally  to  all  objects,  and  consequently 
cannot  be  derived  empirically  by  generalisation  from  experi- 
ence.1 It  is  true  that  he  has  found  the  origin  of  these  categories 
in  the  understanding  and  in  the  necessary  forms  of  judgement 
— this  is  the  result  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction.  A  rationalist 
might,  however,  accept  this,  and  might2  none  the  less  hold 
to  the  rationalist  position  that  the  mind  possesses,  in  its  own 
right,  a  power  of  understanding,  or  reason,  by  which  it  is  able 
to  grasp  a  priori  the  necessary  and  universal  characteristics  of 
things  as  they  are  in  themselves.  The  difficulty  of  justifying 
the  application  of  the  categories  to  objects — a  difficulty  upon 
which  Kant  has  laid  so  much  stress — rests  partly  on  the  fact 
that  hitherto  he  has  deliberately  kept  it  an  open  question 
whether  the  rationalist  doctrine  may  not  be  the  correct 
one.3 

Having  stated  the  problem,  he  now  passes  to  the  method 
of  solution.  He  argues  that  a  rationalist  solution  is  impossible, 
and  that  the  only  way  of  solving  the  problem  is  to  adopt  the 
Copernican  standpoint  of  the  Critical  Philosophy. 


1  We  acquire  knowledge  of  the  categories,  that  is,  we  bring  them 
into  clear  consciousness,  by  generalisation  or  abstraction  from  experi- 
ence; but  they  possess  a  claim  to  universal  and  necessary  validity 
which  cannot  be  derived  from  experience,  but  must,  according  to 
Kant,  be  due  to  their  origin  in  the  nature  of  the  mind. 

2  This  position  was  actually  held  by  some  of  Kant's  critics.  See 
M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  474  n). 

3  Compare  B  22.   It  rests  mainly  on  the  fact  that  the  categories 
and  intuitions  are  heterogeneous;  see  A  137  =  B  176. 


XVII  §  2]         THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  337 

There  are  only  two  possible  ways  in  which  ideas1  can  be 
related  to  their  objects.  Either  the  object  makes  the  idea 
possible,  or  the  idea  makes  the  object  possible.2  The  first 
alternative  is  the  doctrine  of  realism ;  the  second  is  the  doctrine 
which  alone,  if  Kant  is  right,  can  explain  the  possibility  of 
a  priori  ideas. 

§  2.  Empirical  Ideas 

If  the  object  makes  the  idea  possible,  the  idea  must  be 
empirical.  This  is  true  of  appearances,  as  regards  that  element 
in  them  which  belongs  to  sensation.3 

It  would  perhaps  be  clearer  to  say  that  intuitions  must  be 
empirical  so  far  as  they  are  given  to  us  in  sensation,  which 
is  made  possible  by  the  object.  Concepts  also  are  empirical  so 
far  as  they  are  derived  by  abstraction  from  such  empirical 
intuitions ;  and  they  too  are  made  possible  by  the  object,  since 
the  object  makes  possible  the  empirical  intuitions  from  which 
they  are  derived.4 

1  Kant  uses  the  curious  phrase  'synthetic  ideas'.   If  this  is  not  a 
misprint,  he  may  be  referring  to  complex  intuitions — like  the  intuition 
of  a  chair  as  opposed  to  the  intuition  of  a  colour — and  to  concepts, 
which,  as  we  have  seen,  are  concepts  of  a  synthesis. 

2  A  92  =  B  124.  A  fuller  statement  is  to  be  found  in  B  XVII ;  compare 
also  B  1 66  and  A  128-9.  The  usual  difficulty  arises  here  as  to  what 
Kant  means  by  Object',  and  it  may  be  argued  that  the  word  is  used 
in  two  different  senses ;  compare  Prichard,  KanCs  Theory  of  Knowledge, 
pp.  15  ff.  It  is  probably  best  to  take  'object'  at  first  on  the  common- 
sense  level.  A  chair,  for  example,  is  supposed  to  give  us  our  intuition 
of  'chair',  and  from  this  we  derive  the  concept  of  'chair*  by  abstraction 
— the  object  makes  the  idea  possible.  Kant  argues  that  we  could 
have  neither  the  intuition  of  a  chair,  nor,  consequently,  the  empirical 
concept  of  'chair',  unless  we  imposed  upon  the  given  intuitions  the 
category  of  substance  and  accident ;  the  category  therefore  makes  the 
object — the  chair  as  known  to  us — possible.  It  we  accept  this,  the 
chair  becomes  a  phenomenal  object;  but  it  is  still  the  phenomenal 
cause  of  our  sense-data,  though  the  ultimate  cause  or  condition  of 
our  sense-data  is  the  thing-in-itself.  No  doubt  this  position  is  compli- 
cated— too   complicated  for  either  Kant  or  an  expositor  of  Kant  to 
repeat  every  time  the  word  'object',  is  used — but  I  cannot  see  that 
it  is  unintelligible  or  self-contradictory. 

8  A  92  =  B  125.  4  Compare  B  XVII. 


338      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVII  §  3 

So  far  as  any  idea,  whether  intuition  or  concept,  is  made 
possible  by  the  object,  it  is  empirical;  and  so  far  as  any  idea 
is  empirical,  it  is  made  possible  by  the  object.1 

§3.  A  priori  Ideas 

If  an  idea  is  pure  or  a  priori,  it  cannot,  on  this  view,  be 
made  possible  by  the  object.  We  must  either  give  up  a  belief 
in  a  priori  ideas,  or  ask  ourselves  whether  our  ideas  can  perhaps 
apply  to  objects  a  priori,  because  it  is  they  which  make  the 
objects  possible. 

This  is  a  more  difficult  case.  We  are  not  considering  the 
will,  where  we  can  have  an  idea  of  an  object,  and  then  go  on 
to  make  the  object  real  by  action.  What  we  are  considering 
is  knowledge,  and  it  is  obvious,  at  any  rate  to  Kant,  that  in 
knowledge  our  ideas  do  not  produce  their  objects,  so  far  as 
existence  is  concerned.  Even  if  we  can  produce  an  idea  of  an 
object,  this  does  not  make  the  object  itself  real. 

The  suggestion  which  Kant  puts  forward  is  this.  Although 
an  idea  cannot  make  its  object  real,  it  might  nevertheless 
determine  a  priori  the  character  of  the  object  as  known.  An  idea 
will  necessarily  determine  the  character  of  all  objects  without 
exception,  if  only  through  this  idea  is  it  possible  for  anything 
to  be  known  by  us  as  an  object. 

This  is  the  suggestion  upon  which  the  whole  of  Kant's 
philosophy  rests. 

§  4.  Pure  Intuition  and  Pure  Concepts 

Whatever  may  be  said  about  the  being  of  an  object,  no 
object  can  be  known  without  both  intuition  and  conception 
or  thought.  Intuition  is  necessary,  for  only  through  intuition 
is  an  object  given — yet  (if  we  consider  intuition  in  abstraction 
from  thought)  it  is  given,  not  as  an  object  in  the  full  sense, 

1  This  doctrine  is  Kant's  own  doctrine  in  regard  to  all  empirical 
ideas,  so  far  as  their  matter  is  concerned.  The  form,  or  universality, 
of  empirical  concepts  is,  however,  made  by  thinking  (see  Chapter  IX 
§§  4-6);  and  the  forms  of  empirical  intuitions — space  and  time — 
are  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 


XVII  §  4]          THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  339 

but  only  as  an  appearance.1  If  we  are  to  know  an  object  in  the 
full  sense  of  a  real  and  concrete  thing,  we  require  also  concep- 
tion ;  for  only  by  means  of  a  concept2  can  we  think  an  object 
corresponding  to  our  intuition.3 

It  has  been  shown  in  the  Aesthetic  that  space  and  time,  as 
forms  under  which  alone  an  object  can  be  intuited,  must  have 
iheir  origin  in  the  mind,  and  so  must  condition  objects  a 
priori*  As  given  appearances,  objects  must  necessarily  conform 
to  these  formal  conditions  of  sensibility. 

The  question  now  arises  whether  there  may  be  pure  concepts 
or  categories  which,  although  they  are  not  (like  space  and  time) 
conditions  under  which  alone  anything  can  be  intuited,  are 
nevertheless  conditions  under  which  alone  anything  can  be 
thought  as  an  object  in  general.5  If  thought  as  well  as  intuition 

1  This — it  should  be  unnecessary  to  say — does  not  mean  we  should 
know  that  it  was  only  an  appearance  :  we  should  be  below  the  level 
at  which  appearance  is  distinguished  from  reality  or  the  subjective 
from  the  objective.  Nevertheless,  we  can  look  back  at  this  level  and 
describe   it  from  a  higher  point  of  view.   'Appearance',  it  should 
be  noted,  is  commonly  applied    to    the  whole  phenomenal  object 
(as   opposed   to  the  thing-in-itself).  Here  it  seems  to    be   used   for 
what  is  to-day  called  the  sensum  or  sense-datum  as  opposed  to  the 
phenomenal  object,  though  the  commonest  sense  is  also  possible. 

2  The  concept  here  may  be  an  empirical  concept — to  know  this 
red  billiard-ball  we  must  not  only  see  the  colour,  we  must  think  that 
it  is  the  colour  of  a  billiard-ball.  This,  however,  presupposes  the 
category  of  substance  and  accident. 

3  The  sense  in  which  we  must  interpret  such  correspondence,  if 
we  accept  Kant's  Critical  doctrine,  is  discussed  in  A  104  ff. ;  compare 
also  A  189  —  B  234  fT.  and  A  197  =  B  242  ff. 

4  Kant  adds  'as  regards  the  form'  (der  Form  nacti).  Perhaps  this 
is  parallel  to  the  phrase  in  A  93   —  B  126  'as  regards  the  form  of 
thinking'  (der  Form  des  Denkens  nach).   If  so,  it  seems  to  involve 
repetition,  and  means  only  'so  far  as  the  form  of  intuition  is  con- 
cerned*. It  is  perhaps  just  conceivable  that  Kant  is  referring  to  their 
empirical  form — see  A  127-8  and  Chapter  VI  §  8 — but  I  should 
hesitate  to  maintain  this. 

6  A  93  =  B  125-6.  Kemp  Smith  translates  this  passage  :  'The 
question  now  arises  whether  a  priori  concepts  do  not  also  serve  as 
antecedent  conditions  under  which  alone  anything  can  be,  if  not 
intuited,  yet  thought  as  an  object  in  general'.  In  his  Commentary, 
p.  222,  he  implies  that  the  words  'if  not  intuited,  yet*  are  not  genuinely 
Critical.  I  can  see  no  justification  for  this  assertion. 


340      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVII  §  5 

is  necessary  for  knowledge  or  experience  of  an  object,  and  if 
there  are  certain  conditions  or  forms  necessary  to  such  thought, 
then  our  empirical  knowledge  of  objects  must  conform  to  these 
conditions  of  thought  as  well  as  to  the  conditions  imposed  by 
our  sensibility;  for  unless  it  did  so,  there  could  not  be  such 
a  thing  as  an  object  of  experience. 

§  5.  The  object 

Difficulties  may  again  be  raised,  in  this  connexion,  about 
Kant's  use  of  the  word  'object'.  It  may  be  urged,  for  example, 
that  since  there  is  strictly  no  object  apart  from  thought,  we 
ought  not  to  say  that  the  object  is  given  or  intuited  as  an 
appearance. 

As  against  this  I  would  maintain  that  although  such  state- 
ments may  be  difficult,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  Kant's  revolutionary 
doctrine  can  be  stated  better.  If  we  are  to  follow  his  theory, 
we  must  set  aside  any  view  which  supposes  him  to  be  describing 
a  temporal  process  whereby  we  pass  from  given  intuitions  to 
knowledge  of  an  object.  We  must  start  from  the  fact  that  we 
know  this  concrete  individual  object — for  example,  this  tree. 
If  we  are  to  know  this  tree,  it  must  be  given  to  intuition ;  its 
colour  and  shape  must  be  given  to  sight  under  the  forms  of 
time  and  space,  and  this  means  that  the  tree  is  so  far  given. 
But  if  the  tree  is  known  as  a  tree,  thought  also  is  present: 
we  must  employ  the  concept  of  'tree'  and  indeed  the  category 
of  substance  and  accident.  There  is  only  one  object,  namely 
this  green  tree;  and  it  is  known  only  through  a  combination 
of  sight  and  thought.  Nevertheless  if  we  separate,  by  abstraction, 
the  seeing  from  the  thinking,  the  seeing  would  at  most  give 
us  the  colour,  and  we  should  not  know  the  colour  to  be  what 
it  is,  namely  the  colour  of  a  tree;  while  the  thinking  would 
give  us  only  the  concept  of  'treeness'1  and  no  individual  object 

1  Or  the  concept  of  'green  trees  in  general*.  Indeed  if  we  consider 
thinking  in  complete  abstraction  from  what  is  given  to  sense,  all  we 
should  have  would  be  the  empty  concept  of  Something1,  the  concept 
of  an  object  in  general. 


XVII  §  6]          THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  341 

at  all.  It  is  only  through  the  combination  of  intuition  and 
thought  that  we  can  know  the  concrete  determinate  object.1 

If  this  is  true,  then,  according  to  Kant,  the  conditions  of 
thought,  as  well  as  the  conditions  of  intuition,  must  determine 
a  priori  the  nature  of  the  object  as  known. 

§*9    The  Concept  of  an  Object  in  General 

At  this  point  we  should  expect  Kant  to  remind  us  that  the 
conditions  or  forms  of  thought  are  the  forms  of  judgement, 
and  that  the  forms  of  judgement  as  determining  the  synthesis 
of  given  intuitions  are  the  categories.  He  has  indeed  referred 
to  this  doctrine,  when  he  has  asked  'whether  there  may  not 
be  a  priori  concepts  which  are  conditions  under  which  alone 
anything  can  be  thought  as  an  object  in  general*  ;2  and  he  makes 
a  further  reference  to  it  in  a  parenthesis.3  The  reader,  however, 
is  ?:pt  to  be  puzzled  by  the  fact  that  the  argument  is  made  to 
turn  on  'the  concept  of  an  object  in  general',  a  concept  which 
has  been  explicitly  connected  with  the  categories  only  in  the 
question  which  I  have  just  quoted. 

No  doubt  we  have  had,  even  apart  from  this  question,  many 
hints  that  categories  are  concepts  of  an  object  in  general.4 

1  Compare  A  258  =  B  314:  'It  is  only  in  combination  that  under- 
standing  and  sensibility  can,  in  the  case  of  human  beings,  determine 
objects.  If  we  separate  them,  we  have  intuitions  without  concepts  or 
concepts  without  intuitions,  but  in  both  cases  ideas  which  can  refer 
to  no  determin?te  object'.  See  also  A  51  =  B  75. 

It  should  be  noted  that  both  concepts  and  intuitions  are  necessary 
to  determine  an  object.  Kant  sometimes  speaks  as  if  the  categories 
(or  concepts  of  an  object  in  general)  determined  given  intuitions 
(or  the  manifold  of  intuition) ;  and  he  sometimes  speaks  as  if  given 
intuitions  determined  the  categories;  see  for  example,  B  128-9, 
B  143,  A  251. 

*  A  93  =  B  125.  Conditions'  are  commonly  equated  with  forms'. 

8  A  93  =  B  126:  'Experience  (so  far  as  the  form  of  thought  is  con- 
cerned) is  possible  through  the  categories  alone.'  To  the  further 
doctrine  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction — that  the  categories  are 
concepts  of  pure  synthesis — he  may  be  said  to  allude,  though  very 
indirectly,  when  he  comes  to  the  subjective  side  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction  in  A  94. 

4  In  A  55  =  B  80  Kant  speaks  about  pure  thought  of  an  object 
(or  of  objects),  and  in  A  57  =  B  81  about  thinking  objects  completely 


342       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION       [XVII  §  7 

In  particular  the  conclusion  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction 
was  that  the  categories  apply  a  priori  to  objects,1  and  that 
through  them  alone  can  we  think  an  object  of  intuition.2 
Nevertheless  the  exposition  would  have  gained  greatly  in 
clarity,  if  Kant  had  asserted  explicitly  that  the  categories 
must  therefore  be  regarded  as  concepts  of  an  object  in  general? 

§  7.  The  Method  of  the  Objective  Deduction 

When  we  consider  experience,  we  find  that  always  and 
everywhere  we  have,  in  addition  to  the  given  intuitions,  the 
concept  of  an  object.  It  is  this  concept  which  makes  our  ex- 
perience an  experience,  and  not  merely  a  series  of  sensations. 
The  size,  shape,  colour,  and  so  on,  which  we  intuit,  are  always 
thought  as  the  size,  shape,  and  colour  of  some  thing  or  some 
object.4 

That  is  to  say,  the  concept  of  an  object  in  general  is  always 
present  in,  and  necessary  to,  our  experience.  It  is  implied  fn 
all  our  empirical  concepts,  such  as  'house*  or  'ship*;  for  to  be 
a  house  or  a  ship  is  to  be  something. 

Kant  believes  that  the  concept  of  an  object  in  general 
necessarily  involves  a  variety  of  different  concepts.  To  be  an 
object  is,  for  example,  to  have  quantity  and  quality  and  to  be 
a  permanent  substance  with  attributes,  a  substance  interacting 
causally  with  other  substances.  The  concept  of  an  object  in 
general  therefore  differentiates  itself  into  concepts  of  objects 
in  general,5  just  as  the  form  of  judgement  differentiates  itself 

a  priori,  and  also  about  concepts  which  may  refer  a  priori  to  objects ; 
compare  also  A  62  =  B  87,  A  64  =  B  89,  A  79  =  B  104,  A  85  = 
B  117-18,  etc. 

1  A  79  =  B  105.  2  A  80  =  B  106. 

8  The  required  assertion  is  made  in  B  128.  Compare  also  Chapter 
XII  §  6. 

4  From  the  point  of  view  of  common  sense  it  would  be  more  natural 
to  say  that  the  concept  of  thing  in  general  is  present  in  all  experience. 
Kant's  contention  is  that  only  by  substituting  for  this  the  concept 
of  an  object  in  general  can  we  justify  a  priori  knowledge. 

6  Compare  Metaphysik  d.  Sitten,  EM.  Ill  (VI  218  n.).  I  do  not 
think  this  implies  that  each  category  is  valid  of  some  objects  but 
not  of  others.  Kant  sometimes  speaks  of  'the  concept  of  an  object 


XVII  §  7]          THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  343 

into  the  forms  of  judgement.  These  concepts  of  objects  in 
general,  or  of  an  object  in  general,  are  the  categories. 

If  the  concept  of  an  object  in  general  is  necessary  for 
experience,  and  if  this  concept  differentiates  itself  a  priori 
into  the  categories,  then  clearly  the  objective  validity  of  the 
categories  is  established ;  for  through  them  alone  is  experience 
of  objects  possible.  Every  object,  to  be  an  object  of  experience 
must  be  thought,  not  only  by  means  of  empirical  concepts,  but 
by  means  of  the  categories. 

The  categories  render  experience  possible,  only  in  so  far  as 
the  form  of  thought1 — not  in  so  far  as  the  given  matter  or  the 
form  of  intuition — is  concerned. 

The  categories,  on  this  view,  make  the  object  possible  in 
the  sense  that  they  make  it  possible  for  us  to  have  experience, 
or  knowledge,  of  the  object  as  an  object.  We  must  think  the 
object  by  means  of  the  categories,  if  it  is  to  be  known.  Hence 
our  thinking  imposes  upon  the  object  certain  categorial  charac- 
teristics, and  the  object  as  an  object  known  to  us  must  have  these 
characteristics.  It  is  therefore  possible  for  us  to  have  a  priori 
knowledge  of  objects  by  means  of  the  categories;  and  just 
because  thinking  imposes  these  characteristics  upon  objects, 
the  objects  known  are  not  things  as  they  are  in  themselves, 
but  are  things  as  they  must  appear2  to  human  minds,  which 


in  general'  or  *  the  concept  of  something  in  general'  (etwas  tiberhaupt) 
as  the  ultimate  concept  which  is  articulated  in  the  categories.  But 
the  categories  themselves  are  referred  to  indifferently  as  'concepts 
of  objects  in  general'  or  'concepts  of  an  object  in  general1 ;  see,  for 
example,  B  128.  Similarly  there  is  no  difference  between  'the  concept 
of  spaces  in  general*  and  'the  concept  of  space  in  general';  see 
A  25  =  B  39. 

1  A  93  =  B  126.  By  referring  to  the  form  of  thought,  Kant  reminds 
us,  but  somewhat  late  and  not  too  clearly,  of  the  argument  in  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction.  The  form  of  thought  is  also  called  the 
intellectual  form  of  all  knowledge  of  an  object  (see  A  129).  It  differen- 
tiates itself  into  the  forms  or  conditions  of  thought  (see  A  94  =  B  126). 

2  We  are  now  concerned  with  the  object,  not  as  it  would  appear 
to  sense  in  abstraction  from  thought  (as  we  were  in  the  previous 
chapter),  but  as  it  must  appear  to  both  sense  and  thought.  Compare 
Chapter  II  §  2. 


344      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XVII  §  8 

can   know    objects    only   by   a    combination   of  sense   and 
thought.1 

§  8.  The  Principle  of  Transcendental  Deduction  in  General 

The  basic  contention  of  this  argument — that  necessary 
and  universal  characteristics  of  objects,  if  they  are  to  be  known 
as  necessary  and  universal,  must  be  due  to  the  nature  of  the 
mind  which  knows — is  the  fundamental  doctrine  of  the  whole 
Critical  Philosophy  and  the  ground  of  the  Copernican  revolu- 
tion. We  have  met  it  already  in  connexion  with  space  and  time ; 
and  it  is  here  emphasised  at  the  beginning  of  the  Transcen- 
dental Deduction,  as  it  is  reiterated  at  the  end,  both  in  the 
first2  and  in  the  second3  edition. 

Kant  makes  the  general  character  of  his  argument  perfectly 
clear.  The  transcendental  deduction  of  all  a  priori  concepts — 
whether  they  are  pure  intuitions,  like  space  and  time,  or  pure 
concepts  of  understanding,  like  the  categories — rests  on  one 
principle,  and  on  one  principle  alone:  that  they  must  be 
known  as  a  priori  conditions  of  the  possibility  of  experience. 
If  they  are  pure  intuitions,  they  must  be  known  as  conditions 
(or  forms)  of  the  intuition  to  be  found  in  experience;  and  if 
they  are  pure  concepts,  they  must  be  known  similarly  as 
conditions  (or  forms)  of  the  thought  to  be  found  in  experience. 
One  or  other4  of  these  they  must  be,  and  there  is  no  justification 
of  a  priori  concepts  on  any  other  ground. 

§  9.  The  Method  of  the  Subjective  Deduction 

So  far  Kant  has  dealt  only  with  the  objective  side  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction,  and  he  has  informed  us5  that  the 

1  We  have  so  far  the  first  part  of  Kant's  answer  to  the  question 
'How  can  the  categories  of  the  understanding  apply  to  an  object 
given  to  intuition  which  is  independent  of  thought?'  His  first  answer 
is  that  they  must  apply,  if  any  object  is  to  be  known.  The  explanation 
of  how  they  can,  and  must,  apply  is  to  be  found  in  the  subjective 
side  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  together  with  the  chapters 
on  the  Schematism  and  the  Principles  of  the  Understanding.

4  A  94  =  B  126.  Compare  Am.                                      *  A  XVII. 


XVII  §  9]          THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  345 

argument1 — unduly  condensed  as  it  is — is  by  itself  sufficient 
as  an  objective  deduction.  Since  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
has  also  a  subjective  side,  it  is  only  proper,  in  a  general  intro- 
duction of  this  kind,  that  he  should  refer  to  it;  and  this  he 
duly  proceeds  to  do.2 

He  does  so  in  a  short  paragraph3  which  looks  back  to 
A  77-9  =  B  103-4,  and  forward  to  A  97  and  A  115-16.  This 
paragraph  is  omitted  in  the  second  edition,  and  three  other 
paragraphs  are  substituted  as  a  more  suitable  introduction  to 
the  new  version.4 

There  are  three  original  (or  underivative)  capacities  or 
powers5  of  the  soul  which  are  to  be  regarded  as  sources  of 
knowledge.6  These  contain  in  themselves  what  we  are  looking 
for,  namely,  the  conditions  of  the  possibility  of  all  experience. 
Their  names  are  sense,  imagination,  and  apperception.  This  is 

1 A  92-3  =  B  124-6.  2  A  94-5. 

3  For  no  other  reason  than  that  it  deals  with  the  Subjective  Deduction 
this  passage  is  regarded  as  late  by  Vaihinger  and  Kemp  Smith.  As 
against  this  view  the  continuity  of  Kant's  thought  should  be  noted. 
The  Transcendental  Deduction  of  all  a  priori  concepts  (including 
space  and  time)  must  show  that  they  are  conditions  of  the  possibility 
of  experience.  A  transcendental  deduction  can,  as  we  know,  do  so 
only  by  finding  their  origin  in  the  mind  and  its  powers.  But  there 
are  three  such  powers,  and  each  of  these  must  be  investigated.  The 
three  powers  are  sense,  imagination,  and  apperception.   Sense  has 
been  treated  in  the  Aesthetic ;  it  remains  for  us  to  treat  the  other  two. 

The  reason  why  imagination  must  be  treated  (as  well  as  apperception 
or  understanding)  is  that  imagination  is  the  power  which  overcomes 
the  heterogeneity,  already  noted,  in  the  concepts  of  the  understanding 
and  the  intuitions  to  which  they  are  supposed  to  apply. 

4  It  is  in  the  third  of  these  paragraphs  (B  128-9)  that  Kant  gives 
us  a  definition  of  category  which  connects  it  clearly  with  the  form 
of  judgement,  and  which  ought  to  have  been  given  in  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction  itself.  The  first  two  paragraphs  give  an  interesting  criticism 
of  Locke  and  Hume. 

6  Strictly  speaking,  a  capacity  (Fdhigkeit)  is  passive,  and  a  power 
(Vermo'geri)  is  active.  Sense  is  a  capacity,  imagination  and  under- 
standing are  powers. 

6  They  are  called  'sources'  here,  and  'sources  of  knowledge*  in 
A  97.  Strictly  speaking,  they  are  sources  only  of  elements  in  knowledge. 
To  speak  of  a  power  as  a  source  of  elements  in  knowledge  is  to  say 
that  these  elements  of  knowledge  have  their  origin  in  this  power. 


346      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XVII  §  9 

our  first  introduction  to  apperception  in  the  first  edition,1  and 
we  might  reasonably  have  expected  understanding  as  in  the 
previous  passage.2  Apperception  as  a  power  seems  to  be 
identical  with  thought  or  understanding,  but  there  is  always 
implied  in  the  use  of  this  word  a  suggestion  that  thought 
or  understanding  is  in  some  degree  self-conscious. 

These  three  powers — if  this  word  may  be  used  to  cover  both 
capacities  and  powers — have  an  empirical  and  a  transcendental 
use.3  In  their  empirical  use  they  are  concerned  with  the  given 
matter  of  empirical  ideas ;  in  their  transcendental  use  they  are 
the  source  of  a  priori  ideas,  and  are  concerned  only  with  the 
form,  and  not  with  the  matter,  of  knowledge.  The  transcendental 
use  of  sense  was  considered  in  the  Aesthetic,  where  we  found 
that  our  sensibility  was  the  source  of  space  and  time,  the  forms 
of  intuition.4  We  have  now  to  consider  the  transcendental  use 
of  imagination  and  apperception,  and  to  find  in  them  the  sources 
of  the  schematised  and  pure  categories,  the  latter  being  forms 
of  thought  (as  determining  given  intuitions). 

Kant  mentions  what  is  contributed  to  knowledge  by  these 
three  powers  in  their  transcendental  use.5  We  have  three 
things  grounded  upon  them:  (i)  the  synopsis  of  the  a  priori 
manifold6  through  sense;  (2)  the  synthesis  of  this  a  priori 
manifold  through  imagination;  and  (3)  the  unity  of  this  syn- 
thesis through  original  apperception. 

1  In  the  second  edition  it  is  mentioned  in  B  68. 

2  A  78  =  B  103.  It  must,  however,  be  remembered  that  'appercep- 
tion' was  a  word  more  familiar  to  Kant's  readers  than  it  is  to  us. 

8  The  transcendental  use  of  powers  is  here  their  use  as  sources  of 
the  conditions  of  experience — not  their  use  beyond  the  limits  of 
experience.  See  Chapter  XI  §  4. 

4  The  empirical  use  of  sense  is  the  reception  of  given  sensa. 

6  Kant  does  not  here  state  the  obvious  fact  that  in  the  empirical 
use  of  these  powers  the  given  manifold  and  the  synthesis  would  be 
empirical;  compare  A  77  =  B  103. 

6  Vaihinger  (Die  Transcendentale  Deduktion,  pp.  60-1  =  38-9) 
seems  to  hold  that  in  this  passage  sense  gives  us  an  a  priori  synopsis 
of  an  empirical  manifold.  By  this  means  he  contrives  to  make  A  94 
inconsistent  with  §  10.  He  is  followed  by  Kemp  Smith,  Commentary, 
p.  226.  This  interpretation  seems  to  me  not  only  superfluous  but 
impossible. 


XVII  §  9]          THE  METHOD  OF  SOLUTION  347 

This  doctrine  is  the  same  doctrine  as  in  §  10,  for  in  addition 
to  the  a  priori  manifold  and  the  pure  synthesis  mentioned 
there,1  it  was  pointed  out  that  the  unity  of  the  pure  synthesis 
was  due  to  the  concepts  which  rest  on  the  understanding ;  or  in 
other  words  which  have  their  origin  in  original  apperception.2 

The  word  Synopsis'  is  applied  to  sense,  because  there  is 
always  in  intuition,  whether  empirical  or  pure,  a  manifoldness.3 
The  word  'synthesis'  would  be  inappropriate  in  connexion 
with  sense,  because  synthesis  involves  an  active  uniting  of  the 
manifold,  while  sense  is  passive  and  does  not  unite  its  manifold. 

Kant  does  not  take  enough  trouble  to  make  his  terminology 
uniform,4  and  this  leads  his  critics  to  attribute  to  him  incon- 
sistencies in  doctrine  which  are  the  product  of  their  own 
excessive  attention  to  his  words,  and  their  failure  to  penetrate 
to  the  meaning  behind  the  words.5  Kant  nowhere  recognises 
original  sources  of  knowledge  other  than  sense,  imagination, 
and  understanding  or  apperception ;  and  he  nowhere  supposes 
that  the  pure  or  transcendental  synthesis  can  take  place  except 
through  the  medium  of  a  pure  manifold.6 

1  A  78-9  =  B  104.  2  See  Chapter  XIII  §  7. 

3  A  97.  Kant's  use  of  this  term,  I  think,  supports  the  view  that 
he  did  not  accept  the  psychological  atomism  of    Hume;  compare 
Chapter  VI  §  8. 

4  It  may  be  observed  that  even  Plato,  superior  as  he  is  to  Kant 
both  in  elegance  and  in  accuracy  of  style,   is  inconsistent  in  his 
terminology  in  connexion  with  the  Line  and  the  Cave  in  the  Republic. 

6  In  some  cases  Vaihinger  forces  inconsistencies  on  Kant  by  failing 
to  see  even  the  plain  meaning  of  his  words. 

6  The  pure  category,  it  is  true,  is  the  concept  of  the  synthesis  of 
a  manifold  in  general  (without  reference  to  the  pure  manifold  of 
time).  But  this  concept  has  no  validity  except  as  schematised  with 
reference  to  the  manifold  of  time. 


CHAPTER    XVIII 
THE   PROVISIONAL   EXPOSITION 

§  i.  The  Method  of  Exposition 

Kant  is  conscious  that  the  elaborateness  and  intricacy  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction  will  be  a  source  of  difficulty  to  the 
reader.  For  this  reason  he  gives  us  first  of  all  a  provisional  or 
preparatory  exposition.1  He  hopes  to  simplify  the  final  exposition 
by  working  out  some  of  the  details  beforehand.  Perhaps  he 
thought  that  the  reader  should  be  introduced  by  stages  to  the 
most  revolutionary  part  of  his  theory. 

Such  a  method  of  exposition  has,  I  think,  something  to 
recommend  it  in  principle,  but  its  application  in  detail  suffers 
from  serious  defects. 

Kant  himself  suggests  that  the  provisional  exposition  by 
itself  will  be  obscure,  and  will  become  clear  only  when  we 
have  mastered  the  final  or  authoritative  exposition  in  Section  3 . 
He  even  warns  us  that  the  provisional  exposition  is  to  prepare 
rather  than  to  instruct  us ;  it  deals  in  abstraction  and  in  isolation 
with  questions  whose  systematic  treatment  is  reserved  till 
later.2 

This  warning  must  be  taken  seriously,  if  we  are  to  understand 
the  argument.  We  must  not  suppose  that  because  Kant  treats 
in  isolation  the  three  factors  in  synthesis,  he  has  therefore 
introduced  a  new  doctrine  that  there  are  three  syntheses  instead 
of  one.  Still  less  must  we  suppose  that  because  he  first  discusses 
what  is  meant  by  an  'object',  and  reserves  till  later  the  justifi- 
cation of  the  categories,  the  account  of  the  'object*  must 
therefore  have  been  written  at  a  time  when  he  did  not  know 
what  categories  were. 

It  is  more  difficult  to  be  sure  whether  Kant's  warning 

means  that  some  of  the  doctrines  set  forth  in  the  provisional 

exposition  are  not  to  be  taken  as  his  true  view,  but  are  intended 

only  to  lead  the  reader  towards  the  truth.  The  doctrine  of 

*A  98.  2A  98,  A  115. 


XVIII  §  2]      THE  PROVISIONAL  EXPOSITION  349 

imagination  differs  in  the  two  expositions,  and  I  believe  that 
Kant  may  have  intended  to  suggest  that  where  the  two  exposi- 
tions differ,  it  is  the  final  exposition  whose  doctrine  is  to  be 
accepted. 

This  is,  however,  a  source  of  real  difficulty.  We  are  expected 
to  filtup  the  details  of  the  final  exposition  from  the  provisional 
one ;  but  how  can  we  do  so  with  confidence,  if  the  provisional 
exposition  is  not  in  all  respects  reliable?  Nevertheless  it  is 
impossible  to  avoid  doing  so,  for  in  certain  respects  the  earlier 
discussion,  as  Kant  himself  suggests,  is  more  adequate  and 
detailed  than  the  later. 

In  this  matter  we  must  do  the  best  we  can,  but  it  is  not 
surprising  that  in  view  of  the  real  defects  in  his  method  of 
exposition,  Kant  has  substituted  a  clearer  and  better  statement 
in  the  second  edition. 

§  2.  Repetitions 

The  method  adopted  by  Kant  is  bound  to  lead  to  a  great 
deal  of  repetition,  and  these  repetitions  are  increased  by  his 
habit  of  beginning  new  sections  with  a  little  introduction  and 
finishing  them  with  a  review  or  summary  of  what  has  gone 
before.  From  the  accounts  given  of  his  method  in  lecturing,1 
it  looks  as  if  a  practice  which  is  useful  in  expounding  difficult 
subjects,  especially  to  beginners,  had  become  somewhat 
exaggerated,  and  perhaps  almost  mechanical,  with  the  advance 
of  years. 

Kant's  habit  of  repetition,  and  indeed  the  mere  fact  that, 
apart  altogether  from  introductions  and  summaries,  there  are 
two  expositions  in  the  first  edition,  and  another  one  in  the 
second,  makes  the  task  of  expounding  the  Transcendental 
Deduction  peculiarly  difficult.  For  good  or  for  evil  I  have  set 
out,  not  merely  to  state  what  I  believe  Kant's  doctrine  to  be, 
but  also  to  show,  in  the  face  of  modern  criticism,  that  his 
argument  is  an  argument,  and  not  a  collection  of  contradictions. 

1  See  the  account  given  by  Jachmann,  quoted  by  Caird,  The  Critical 
Philosophy  of  Kant,  Vol.  I,  p.  64. 


350      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XVIII  §  3 

In  such  a  task  I  cannot  avoid  repetition.  I  can  only  hope  to 
reduce  it  to  the  necessary  minimum,  and  I  will  try  to  keep 
the  lines  of  the  argument  as  clear  as  possible  by  relegating  to 
footnotes  discussion  of  the  many  obscurities  which  we  are 
bound  to  meet.1 

§  3.  The  Objective  Deduction 

True  to  his  method,  Kant  begins  the  provisional  exposition 
with  a  new  introduction,  which  sums  up  his  previous  argument 
and  describes  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  firstly  on  its 
objective,  and  secondly  on  its  subjective,  side. 

On  the  objective  side  we  learn  little  more  than  we  know 
already.  The  categories  contain  a  priori  the  pure  thought2 
involved  in  every  experience,  and  in  order  to  show  their 
objective  validity  we  have  to  prove  that  through  them  alone 
can  an  object  be  thought.3 

This  contention  is  supported  by  considerations  with  which 
we  are  now  familiar.  Concepts  have  no  content4  apart  from 
intuitions,  by  which  alone  objects  can  be  given  to  us.  Intuition 
in  general  constitutes  the  field,  or  the  total  given  object,  of 
possible  experience.  Hence  an  a  priori  concept  must  be  related 
to  possible  experience,  if  it  is  to  be  the  thought  of  an  object 
and  not  a  mere  empty  form  which  thinks  nothing.5 

If  the  categories  are  a  priori  concepts,  they  cannot  contain 
anything  empirical,  or  in  other  words  they  cannot  be  derived 
from  empirical  intuition.  They  must  none  the  less,  if  they 
have  objective  validity,  be  related  to  possible  experience; 
and  this  they  can  be,  only  if  they  are  a  priori  conditions  of 

1  As  I  have  now  indicated  the  broad  lines  of  Kant's  argument  in 
the  Transcendental  Deduction,  the  reader  who  wishes  to  discover 
how  the  general  theory  works  out  may  prefer  to  go  straight  on  to 
Chapter  XXX. 

2  Kant  might   also   have   said   'the   form   of  thought';   compare 
Chapter  XI  §  2.  8  A  96-7. 

4  They  could  have  the  form  of  thought  as  their  content,  but  Kant 
regards  this  form  as  empty.  A  concept  of  this  kind  would  be  'the 
logical  form  of  a  concept',  rather  than  a  concept  which  thinks  any 
object.  8  A  95. 


XVIII  §  3]     THE  PROVISIONAL  EXPOSITION  351 

such  a  possible  experience.  Hence  we  have  to  enquire  what 
are  the  a  priori  conditions  on  which  experience  rests  (so  far 
as  the  thought  involved  in  experience  is  concerned);  and  the 
concept  which  expresses  these  conditions1  adequately  and 
universally2  will  be  the  pure  concept  of  the  understanding 
which  we  seek.  These  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding 
must  contain3  pure  a  priori  conditions,  both  of  experience, 
and  of  its  object*  Otherwise  not  only  would  they  be  thoughts 
of  nothing;  they  would  not  arise,  even  in  thought,  apart  from 
the  given  data  of  experience.5 

Kant  makes  one  new  point.  Although  the  categories  must 
have  this  relation  to  experience  if  they  are  to  be  thoughts  of 
an  object,  and  even  if  they  are  to  arise  in  thought,  nevertheless, 
once  I  possess  the  categories,  I  can  invent  concepts  of  objects 
which  are  either  impossible  in  themselves  or  incapable  of 
being  given  in  any  experience. 

For  example,  I  can  invent  the  concept  of  spirit  or  soul, 
that  is,  the  concept  of  an  immaterial  substance  possessed  of 
reason;6  I  do  so,  however,  by  leaving  out  something  which 

1  These   conditions    are   'formal',  concerned  with  form  not  with 
matter;    and  they  are  'objective',   that  is,  they  are  universal  and 
necessary  conditions  of  objects  being  known — a  subjective  condition 
would,  I  take  it,  be  peculiar  to  an  individual  or  a  set  of  individuals. 
These  objective  conditions  have  their  origin  in  subjective  capacities 
or  powers,  and  such  capacities  or  powers  are  therefore,  in  the  last 
resort,  conditions  of  objects  being  known;  but  Kant  would  not  call 
these  capacities  or  powers  'objective*,  presumably  because  they  belong 
to  the  mind  and  not  to  the  object.  This  suggests  that  objective 
conditions  must  be  elements  in  the  character  of  the  object  itself, 
as  well  as  conditions  of  its  being  known. 

2  This  seems  to  me  to  imply  that  the  categories  are  conditions 
of  all  experience  and  not  merely  of  some. 

3  A  96.  Kant  says  indifferently  that  the  categories  'are*  or  'express* 
or  'contain*  the  conditions  of  experience. 

4  A  96.  Compare  Am:  'The  a  priori  conditions  of  a  possible 
experience    are    also    conditions    of    the    possibility    of   objects    of 
experience*. 

6  I  take  it  that  when  Kant  speaks  of  'the  elements  of  all  a  priori 
cognitions',  he  has  in  mind  the  categories,  which  are  correctly  so 
described. 

6  See  Trdume  eines  Geistersehers,  i.  Teily  i.  Haupts.  (II  321)  and  also 
the  Paralogisms. 


352     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XVIII  §  4 

is  a  necessary  condition  of  possible  experience.  Kant  does  not 
tell  us  what  is  left  out.  I  take  it  to  be  'the  permanent'  which 
is  given  in  intuition.  This  we  can  find  only  in  outer  intuition, 
and  so  only  in  material  substances ;  and  it  is  necessary,  if  the 
category  of  substance  is  to  have  validity. 

1  can  invent  also  the  concept  of  God,  and  this  I  do  by 
extending  the  categories  beyond  the  limits  of  experience. 
Again  Kant  gives  us  no  details  of  this  process ;  but  it  obviously 
takes  place  when  we  say  that  God  must  be  the  First  Cause, 
or  that  He  must  be  the  ens  realissimum. 

Possibilities  of  this  kind  are  no  argument  against  the  view 
that  the  categories  must  contain  the  conditions  of  experience 
and  must  be  justified  because  through  them  alone  can  an  object 
of  experience  be  thought. 

§4.  The  Subjective  Deduction 

The  contention  that  the  categories  must  have  objective 
validity  since  only  by  means  of  them  can  an  object  of  experience 
be  thought  is  the  central  argument  of  the  Objective  Deduction.1 
But  such  a  thought  of  objects,  if  it  is  objectively  valid,  is  know- 
ledge, and  indeed  a  priori  knowledge ;  and  in  this  knowledge 
more  must  be  at  work  than  understanding  considered  merely 
as  a  power  of  thinking?  Understanding,  so  far  as  it  has  a  relation 
to  objects,  is  a  power,  not  merely  of  thinking,  but  of  knowing; 
and  we  must  explain  how  it  can  have  this  relation  to  objects, 
or  in  other  words  how  it  can  be  a  power  of  a  priori  knowledge.3 
This  explanation  is  the  task  of  the  Subjective  Deduction. 

Understanding,  as  a  power  of  knowing,  requires  the  co- 
operation of  sense  and  imagination,  and  we  have  to  investigate 
the  possibility  of  pure  understanding  (as  a  power  of  a  priori 
knowledge)  and  of  the  powers  of  cognition  on  which  it  rests.4 

*A  96-7. 

2  A  97.  For  the  distinction  between  thinking   and   knowing   see 
Chapter  II  §  4. 

8  On  Kant's  view,  if  it  were  not  a  power  of  a  priori  knowledge, 
it  could  not  be  a  power  of  knowledge  at  all. 

4  A  XVI-XVII.When  Kant  says  this  investigation  is  concerned  with 
the  question  'How  is  the  power  of  thinking  itself  possible?',  he  ought 


XVIII  §  s]      THE  PROVISIONAL  EXPOSITION  353 

We  have  therefore  to  consider  the  subjective  sources  of 
cognition  which  form  the  a  priori  foundation  of  the  possibility 
of  experience.  These  sources  we  already  know  to  be  sense, 
imagination,  and  understanding  (or  apperception) — the  last, 
apart  from  sense  and  imagination,  being  a  power  of  thinking, 
not  of  knowing.  Since  we  are  concerned  with  them  as  giving 
us  (in  conjunction)  a  priori  knowledge,  we  are  naturally  con- 
cerned not  with  their  empirical,  but  with  their  transcendental, 
character.1 

§  5.  The  Threefold  Synthesis 

We  are  already  aware  that  for  knowledge  we  must  have 
three  things:  (i)  a  given  sensuous  manifold,  which  may  be 
empirical  or  pure;  (2)  a  synthesis  of  imagination;  and  (3)  a 
bringing  of  the  synthesis  to  concepts  by  understanding.2 
We  are  also  aware  that  for  a  priori  knowledge  the  manifold 
must  be  pure,  and  that  the  synthesis  of  this  manifold  receives 
its  unity  from  pure  concepts  which  have  their  origin  in  apper- 
ception.3 Furthermore  these  pure  concepts  are  concepts  of 
pure  synthesis  ;4  and  they  receive  their  stuff  from  space  and 
time,  which  contain  a  pure  manifold  and  also  are  forms  of  the 
empirical  intuitions  through  which  alone  an  object  can  be  given.5 
This  implies  that  every  empirical  synthesis  is  conditioned  by 
a  pure  synthesis. 

Kant  proceeds  to  state  his  theory  again ;  but  as  he  has  just 
referred  to  the  fact  that  sense,  imagination,  and  understanding 

to  say  rather  'How  can  the  power  of  thinking  give  us  a  priori  know- 
ledge?' See  also  Chapter  XI  §  n. 

Note  also  that  in  A  97,  when  Kant  says  that  the  three  subjective 
sources  of  cognition — which  must  be  sense,  imagination,  and  under- 
standing (as  a  power  of  thinking) — make  understanding  itself  possible, 
he  must  mean  that  they  make  understanding  possible  as  a  power 
of  knowing.

354      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XVIII  §  5 

have  both  an  empirical  and  a  transcendental  character,  he  does 
not  think  it  necessary  to  repeat  this.  Furthermore  he  makes 
certain  additions,  and  he  also  introduces  needless  variations 
in  terminology.  With  this  help  Vaihinger  is  able  to  argue 
that  the  doctrine  here  is  entirely  different  from  that  found 
elsewhere.  I  venture  to  maintain  that  the  differences  are  more 
in  the  expression  than  in  the  thought. 

Ideas  require  to  be  combined,  if  we  are  to  have  any- 
thing that  can  be  called  knowledge.1  Consequently  sense  by 
itself  is  not  enough  for  knowledge:  sense  may  be  said  to 
have  a  passive  synopsis,2  because  it  contains  a  manifold; 
but  it  does  not  unite  or  combine  the  given  manifold,  and 
therefore  we  require  in  addition  an  active  synthesis  in  order 
to  do  so.3 

This  synthesis  is  a  threefold  synthesis  necessarily  present 
in  all  knowledge:  (i)  a  synthesis  of  the  apprehension  of  ideas, 
as  modifications  of  the  mind  in  intuition;  (2)  a  synthesis  of 
the  reproduction  of  ideas  in  imagination;  and  (3)  a  synthesis 
of  their  recognition  in  the  concept. 

These  three  syntheses  point  to  three  subjective  sources  of 
knowledge  which  make  possible  understanding  (as  a  power 
of  knowledge)  and  experience  itself  (as  an  empirical  product  of 
understanding).  No  reasonable  man  can  doubt  that  these  three 
subjective  sources  of  knowledge  are  sense,  imagination,  and 
understanding  (as  a  power  of  thought).4 

It  will  be  made  sufficiently  clear  later  that  the  three  syntheses 
are  aspects  of  one  synthesis,5  and  that  each  of  them  is  pure 
as  well  as  empirical.  The  new  doctrines  expressed  are  that  the 
synthesis  of  imagination,  even  when  it  is  pure  or  transcendental, 
is  a  synthesis  of  reproduction  (a  doctrine  peculiar  to  the  pro-

3  Given  appearances  or  isolated  sensa  must  be  combined  into  an 
object,  such  as  a  chair.  This  is  a  common-sense  view  quite  distinct 
from  the  atomism  of  Hume. 

*  Compare  A  115.  The  synthesis  of  apprehension,    although    it  is 
the  work  of  imagination,  points  to  sense  as  a  source  of  knowledge 
because  it  is  a  *  taking  up'  of  what  is  given  to  sense. 

*  Even  here  they  have  just  been  called  'a  threefold  synthesis'. 


XVIII  §  5]      THE  PROVISIONAL  EXPOSITION  355 

visional  exposition);  and — what  is  more  troublesome — that 
there  are  four  factors  at  work  (one  synopsis  and  three  syn- 
theses) instead  of  the  three  factors  which  were  described 
before. 

Nevertheless  the  fact  that  there  are  still  only  three  subjective 
sources  of  knowledge  shows  that  Kant  does  not  intend  any 
serious  departure  from  his  usual  doctrine.  The  synthesis  of 
imagination,  which  was  described  before,1  is  here  analysed 
into  (i)  a  synthesis  of  apprehension  and  (2)  a  synthesis  of 
reproduction.  There  is  only  one  synthesis  of  imagination  in 
which  both  apprehension  and  reproduction  play  their 
part.2 

The  synthesis  of  apprehension  certainly  cannot  be  ascribed 
to  sense,  and  must  be  ascribed  to  imagination,  since  all  syn- 
thesis is  active.  Its  character  is  made  clear  in  A  120-1. 
Imagination  must  apprehend  the  impressions  of  sense,  that  is, 
it  must  take  them  up3  into  its  own  activity.4  Apprehension  is, 
however,  closely  connected  with  intuition,  since  it  is  an  act 
exercised  immediately  or  directly  on  intuition  or  sense- 
perception.5 

This  unnecessary  complication  comes  from  speaking  of 
powers  or  faculties — a  form  of  speech  which  it  is  easier  to 
condemn  than  to  avoid.  It  would  be  simpler  to  say  that  the 
mind  (i)  apprehends  the  given  manifold  of  sense,  (2)  repro- 
duces it  in  imagination,  and  (3)  recognises  or  judges  it  by 
means  of  the  concept.  These  three  acts  are  necessary  for  know- 
ledge of  an  object. 

One  further  addition  made  by  Kant  should  be  noted. 
Apprehension  is  apprehension  of  ideas  'as  modifications  of 
the  mind  in  intuition'.  This  implies  that  what  it  takes  up

belongs  to  inner  sense,  and  so  is  subject  to  the  form  of  time.1 
The  consideration  of  this  point  must  be  postponed.2 

§  6.  Plan  of  the  Argument 

The  argument  is  expounded  in  four  'numbers',  which  we 
may  call  subsections.  These  are  as  follows : 

(1)  The  synthesis  of  apprehension  in  intuition. 

(2)  The  synthesis  of  reproduction  in  imagination. 

(3)  The  synthesis  of  recognition  in  the  concept. 

(4)  The  provisional  explanation  of  the  possibility  of  the 

categories,  as  a  priori  cognitions. 

It  will  be  observed  that  there  is  no  mention  of  the  categories 
till  we  come  to  subsection  4.  It  will  also  be  observed  that  the 
first  three  subsections  seem  to  be  concerned  with  the  sub- 
jective side,  and  the  fourth  subsection  with  the  objective  side, 
of  the  Deduction.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  objective  side  of  the 
Deduction  is  found  in  the  second  part  of  subsection  3  as  well 
as  in  subsection  4.  This  distinction  is,  as  usual,  the  main  reason 
why  the  latter  half  of  the  exposition  is  regarded  by  Vaihinger 
as  earlier  in  origin  than  the  beginning. 

1  Hitherto  no  stress  has  been  laid  on  time  as  opposed  to  space ; 
see  A  55  =  B  79,  A  77  =  B  102,  A  78  =  B  104,  A  85  =  B  118,  etc. 
The  use  of  the  singular  'condition*  (Bedtngung)  in  A  93   —   B  125 
seems  to  have  no  special  significance,  and  I  have  presumed  in  Chapter 
XVII  §  4  that  Kant  was  referring  both  to  time  and  space.

CHAPTER    XIX 
THE  THREEFOLD   SYNTHESIS 

§  i!  The  Importance  of  Time 

The  Transcendental  Deduction  is  possible  only  because 
time  is  the  form  of  inner  sense.  This  is  emphasised  by  Kant 
at  the  very  beginning  of  his  exposition;1  and  his  emphasis 
is  the  more  necessary,  because  time  tends  to  fall  into  the 
background  as  the  argument  proceeds. 

Our  ideas,  as  we  have  seen,  are  of  various  kinds.  Some  are 
empirical  and  some  are  pure;  some  are  due  to  the  influence 
of  outer  things,2  while  others  are  due  to  the  working 
of  our  own  minds.3  However  they  originate,  they  are  all, 
in  one  aspect  of  them,  modifications  of  our  mind;  as  such 
they  belong  to  inner  sense,  and  are  necessarily  subject  to 
time,  the  form  of  inner  sense.  It  is  this  fact  alone  which 
enables  us  to  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  all  objects  of  ex- 
perience.4 

If  an  object  of  experience  is  to  be  known,  it  must  be  given  in 
sensuous  intuition.  Kant  believes  that  every  intuition  contains 
in  itself  a  manifold  or  a  manifoldness,6  but  he  does  not  believe 
that  this  manifold  can  be  'represented'  as  a  manifold  by  means 
of  mere  sense.  If  we  are  to  be  aware  of  a  manifold  as  a  manifold, 
we  must  be  aware  both  of  its  unity  and  of  its  multiplicity  ;  and 
for  this  purpose  the  mind  must  be  active  as  well  as  passive. 


a  These  things  may  be  taken  either  as    things-in-themselves    or  as 
physical  bodies. 

3  Ideas   due  to  the  working  of  our  minds  are  probably  ideas  of 
states  of  the  self;  compare  B  156.  Concepts  (as  regards    their  form) 
and  ideas  of  imagination  might  possibly  be  described  as  due  to  the 
working  of  the  mind  ;  and  so  too  might  all  a  priori  ideas,  if  'working* 
could  cover  passive  sense  as  well  as  active  thought.

358        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  i 

The  manifold  must  be  'run  through'  and  'held  together',  and 
not  merely  received  passively  by  sense.1 

One  of  the  main  reasons  for  this  necessity  is  that  it  takes 
time  to  apprehend  a  manifold  as  a  manifold.  Kant  puts  this 
obscurely  by  saying  that  the  mind  must  distinguish  the  time 
in  the  succession  of  impressions,2  since  each  idea,  as  contained 
in  one  moment,  cannot  be  anything  but  absolute  unity.3 

Kant  is  clearly  mistaken,  if  he  means  that  at  every  moment 
we  are  given  a  single  undifferentiated  sense-impression,  and 
that  we  go  on  to  join  up  undifferentiated  atomic  sense-impres- 
sions into  an  intuition  containing  a  manifold.4  His  view  is  more 
plausible,  if  we  take  it  as  expressing  a  limit  reached  by  analysis. 
Let  us  suppose  him  to  mean  that  if  we  were  to  abstract  from 
the  time-element  in  our  consciousness,  and  ignore  the  con- 
tinuous successive  synthesis  by  which  we  hold  together  what 
is  given  at  different  times  and  in  different  places,  we  should 
be  left  with  something  which  has  no  parts  outside  one  another, 
or  before  and  after  one  another.5 

For  the  present  we  must  pass  over  the  difficulties  of  this 
doctrine.  It  is,  however,  obvious  that  we  cannot  be  aware 
of  an  intuition  as  lasting  through  time — and  all  intuitions  last 
through  some  time — without  holding  together  before  the  mind 
what  is  given  at  different  times.  This  need  not  commit  us  to 
the  view  that  in  any  moment,  taken  apart  from  what  comes 
before  it,  we  can  be  aware  of  a  sense-impression  which  is  an 

1  Kant  says :   'so  ist  er stitch  das  Durchlaufen  der  Mannigfaltigkeit 
und  dann  die  Zusammennehmung  desselben  notwendig*.   The   use   of 
'desselben*  instead  of  'derselben'  is  presumably  due  to  the  influence  of 
the  words  'aus  diesem  Mannigfaltigeri*  at  the  beginning  of  the  sentence. 

2  I  do  not  know  what  this  means,  unless  it  means  that  the  mind 
must  know  as  parts  of  a  succession  the  different  times  in  which 
impressions  are  given.  Compare  A  167  =  B  209. 

8  A  99.  Compare  B  154,  B  202,  A  167  =  B  209,  B  218,  A  192  = 
B  237.  See  also  Chapter  XXXVIII  §  i. 

4  On  this  view  his  ascription  of  'synopsis*  to  sense  would  be  meaning- 
less, and  the  first  results  of  synthesis  would  not  be  'confused';  see 
A  94,  A  97,  and  A  77  =  B  103. 

6  See  especially  A  167  =  B  209  and  note  that  even  then  there  is, 
according  to  A  1 68  =  B  210,  a  kind  of  multiplicity  present.  Compare 
also  Chapters  VI  §  8  and  XLII  §  i. 


XIX  §  2]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  359 

undifferentiated  unity.1  There  can  be  no  idea  in  an  isolated 
point  of  time  any  more  than  there  can  be  a  colour  in  an  isolated 
point  of  space.  The  fact  that  we  can  discuss  these  as  abstractions 
does  not  mean  that  they  are  given  elements  out  of  which  our 
experience  is  constructed.  They  are,  at  most,  elements  into 
which  our  experience  can  be  analysed. 

§  2.  The  Synthesis  of  Apprehension 

The  synthesis  by  which  we  run  through  the  manifold  and 
hold  it  together  in  unity  is  called  the  synthesis  of  apprehension. 

The  synthesis  of  apprehension,  unlike  the  synthesis  of 
reproduction,  is  exercised  directly2  on  sense-impressions  or 
sensa.3  It  involves  a  'taking  up'  4  of  given5  sense-impressions 
into  empirical  consciousness.  Through  apprehension  of  given 
sense-impressions  we  acquire  sense-perception.6 

The  synthesis  of  apprehension  involves  more  than  a  mere 
momentary  taking  up  of  sense-impressions.  It  holds  the 
manifold  of  intuition  together  in  unity.7  Passive  sensibility, 
although  it  can  be  said  to  offer  or  present  a  manifold,8  cannot 
produce9  it  as  a  manifold,  that  is,  as  contained  in  one  idea, 
without  the  help  of  an  active  synthesis. 

Kant  adds  that  this  synthesis  of  apprehension  must  also

2  A  99,  'geradezu.'  This  corresponds  to  'immediately'  (unmittelbar) 
in  A  1 20,  and  ought  to  be  translated. 

3  In  A  99  Kant  says  'on  intuition',  and  in  A  120  he  says  'on  sense- 
perceptions',   but  he  means  the  given  manifold,   that  is,  sensa  or 
sense-impressions. 

4  'aufnehmen.*  See  A  120,  B  153,  B  202,  and  A  190  =  B  235. 

5  See  A  201  =  B  246. 

6lWahrnehmung.'  See  B  162.  Kant,  like  Leibniz,  believed  that 
sensations  need  not  be  conscious,  but  that  apprehension  and  sense- 
perception  always  are  conscious.  Compare  A  120,  B  160,  B  207, 
and  Anthr.^  5  and  9  (VII  135  and  144);  also  the  curious  doctrine 
about  sounds  and  colours  in  K.d.U.  §§  14  and  51  (V  224  and  324). 

7  In   K.d.U.  §   26   (V   251)    Kant  distinguishes   the   'taking  up* 
(Auffassung  or  apprehensio)  from  the  'holding  together'  (Zusammen- 
fassung  or  comprehensio) ;  but  the  synthesis  of  apprehension,  and  even 
apprehension  itself,  is  commonly  used  to  cover  both.

360        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  2 

be  exercised  a  priori,  that  is,  it  must  be  exercised  on  the  pure 
manifold  of  space  and  time,  which  has  its  origin  in  our  sensi- 
bility.1 He  may  mean,  not  only  that  a  pure  synthesis  of  appre- 
hension is  necessary  for  knowledge  of  space  and  time,  but  also 
that  such  a  pure  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  present  in  every 
empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension  as  its  condition.  The  latter 
point  is  in  any  case  made  clear  later;2  and  it  is  obvious  from 
what  he  has  already  said,  namely,  that  all  our  ideas  are  in  time 
as  the  form  of  inner  sense. 

In  the  second  edition,3  as  indeed  even  in  the  first,4  Kant 
defines  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  as  if  it  were  empirical 
only.  This  is  one  of  his  many  variations  in  terminology  which 
do  not  indicate  a  real  difference  in  doctrine.  Kant  never  ceases 
to  hold  that  the  empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  con- 
ditioned by  a  pure  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  time.5 

The  full  description6  of  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  is 
'the  synthesis  of  the  apprehension  of  ideas,  as  modifications 
of  the  mind  in  intuition'.  This  shows  that  apprehension  qud 
apprehension  is  concerned  with  ideas  as  these  are  present 
to  us  in  inner  sense.7  These  ideas  may  be  called  subjective 
in  the  sense  that  for  mere  apprehension  (that  is,  for  appre- 
hension considered  in  abstraction  from  thought)  they  are  not 
ideas  of  an  object.  They  would  be  described  more  accurately, 
if  they  were  said  to  be  neither  subjective  nor  objective,  since 
for  mere  apprehension  they  are  certainly  not  modifications 
of  a  subject  which  is  distinguished  from  objects.8  It  is  through 

1  According  to  B   160-1  n.  it  is  through  this  synthesis  that  the 
manifold  of  space  (and  time)  receives  that  unity  which  is  necessary 
if  we  are  to  have  a  pure  intuition  and  not  merely  a  form  of  intuition. 

2  The  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  the  transcendental  ground  of 
the  possibility  of  all  knowledge,  not  only  empirical,  but  also  pure;

5  See,  for  example,  B  160-1  and  A  165-6  =  B  206.  6  A  97. 

7  This  is  confirmed  by  A  98-9  and  by  A  101,  and  also,  I  think,  by 
the  reference  to  empirical  apprehension  in  A  115. 

8  As  apprehended,  ideas  are  modifications  of  the  mind  or  events 
in  a  mental  history.  We  do  not,  however,  know  them  to  be  such 
except  by  inner  sense  and  reflexion. 


XIX  §  2]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  361 

thought,  and  not  through  mere  apprehension,  that  they  are 
recognised  to  be  ideas  of  an  object ;  and  it  is  only  when  they  are 
recognised  to  be  ideas  of  an  object  that  they  are  recognised 
to  be  themselves  modifications  of  the  mind.  Knowledge  of  an 
object  and  knowledge  of  a  subject  are  for  Kant  correlative 
terms,  so  that  one  always  implies  the  other. 

Kant  is  not  maintaining  that  ideas  are  first  of  all  apprehended, 
and  then  referred  to  an  object  by  thought.  He  is,  on  the  con- 
trary, analysing  our  ordinary  experience  of  objects;  and  his 
doctrine  is  that  when  we  are  seeing,  for  example,  a  red  box, 
we  must  be  taking  up  and  synthetising  given  sensa  by  means 
of  imagination.  This  activity  is  a  necessary  element  in  our 
experience,  and  must  be  distinguished  from  the  thought 
which  is  also  a  necessary  element  in  the  same  experience. 

The  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  closely  connected,1  or  even 
identified,2  with  sense-perception,3  and  therefore  involves 
sensation4  (which  presupposes  the  actual  presence  of  the 
object6).  Nevertheless  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  seems 
to  give  us  more  than  a  mere  sensum.6  In  the  above  example 
it  not  only  unifies  the  red  colour,  but  combines  it  in  imagination 
with  other  sensa,  and  so  gives  us  the  intuition  or  image  of

3  'Wahrnehmung.'  4  B  207,  'EmpfindungS 

5  A  50  =  B  74.  The  object  may  be  taken  here  on  a  common-sense 
level ;  but  I  think  Kant  would  defend  this  statement  both  as  regards 
the  phenomenal  object  and  also  as  regards  the  thing-in-itself  (in 
accordance  with  his  doctrine  of  double  affection).  The  'presence* 
attributed  to  the  thing-in-itself  does  not  imply  that  it  is  present  in 
a  point  of  space  at  a  point  of  time,  but  only  that  it  is  the  unknown 
reality  which  appears.  Imagination  when  not  manifested  in  appre- 
hension does  not  involve  the  presence  either  of  a  phenomenal  object 
or  of  a  thing-in-itself;  compare  B  151  and  A  100. 

Something  similar  to  apprehension  must  be  present  in  dreams 
and  in  fancy,  but  Kant  seems  to  use  Apprehension'  technically  for 
apprehension  of  a  real  object.  Apprehension  is  thus  essentially  an 
element  in  experience,  though  it  must  be  supplemented  by  thought 
to  give  us  knowledge  of  objects.  Compare  A  201  —  B  246. 

8  I  am  taking  a  sensum  here  to  be,  for  example,  a  colour  or  a  sound, 
and  not  merely  the  non-spatial  and  non-temporal  elements  into  which, 
according  to  some  interpretations,  Kant  believed  a  colour  or  a  sound 
could  be  analysed.

362        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  2 

a  box.1  If  this  interpretation  is  correct,  the  synthesis  of  appre- 
hension is  the  name  for  the  whole  synthesis  of  imagination, 
whereby  we  take  up  given  sensa  and  combine  them  into  objects2 
in  space  and  time.  This  synthesis  involves,  as  we  shall  see, 
a  synthesis  of  reproduction;  and  so  far  as  we  know  that  the 
combined  sensa  constitute  a  real  object,  and  not  a  product 
of  mere  fancy,  there  must  also  be  present  a  synthesis  of  recog- 
nition.3 

One  other  point  must  be  added.  It  is  sometimes  held  that 
Kant  makes  a  mistake  in  regarding  sense  as  passive.  I  do  not 
believe  that  this  can  be  properly  called  a  mistake,  unless  by 
those  who  maintain  that  there  is  no  passive  element  in  sense 

1  Compare  B  162  where  we  apprehend  a  house,  and  also  the  freezing 
of  water. 

2  Apart  from  the  difficulty  of  being  sure  about  what  Kant  meant, 
it  is  far  from  easy  to  find  an  unambiguous  terminology  for  the  expres- 
sion of  his  meaning.  The  synthesis  of  apprehension  seems  to  give 
us,  not  only  colours,  sounds,  and  so  on,  as  individual  wholes,  but 
also  complete  visual  and  tactual  'images' — compare  A  120  n. — in  three- 
dimensional  space.   Such  an  image  apart   from   thought  would  be 
indistinguishable  from  the  similar  images  or  apparitions  in  fancy 
and  in  dreams,  and  could  not  be  known  as  a  real  object.  Nevertheless 
the  complex  image  apprehended  in  sense-perception  is  not  an  image 
of  the  real  object  (except  in  so  far  as  it  is  the  appearance  of  an  unknown 
thing-in-itself ) ;  it  is  the  real  (phenomenal)  object,  which,  however, 
is  known  to  be  so  only  because  thought  is  present  in  the  experience 
as  well  as  sense  and  imagination.  We  are  entitled  to  call  it  an  'image' 
only  by  an  act  of  reflective  abstraction  which  separates  apprehension 
from  thought.  The  realist  would  call  it  simply  a  'thing'. 

Kant's  doctrine  would  have  been  clearer,  if  he  had  used,  say, 
'sensum'  for  a  colour  or  sound,  'impression'  for  the  manifold  elements 
into  which  it  can  be  analysed,  and  'appearance'  or  'intuition'  or 
'image'  for  that  combined  whole  of  sensa  which  by  thought  we  recog- 
nise to  constitute  an  object  of  experience  and  which,  in  abstraction 
from  thought,  might  be  called  an  indeterminate  object.  We  ought 
to  have  other  words  for  an  imaginary  object  (or  'apparition')  and  for 
the  similar  elements  to  be  found  within  it.  Perhaps  we  ought  also 
to  have  neutral  words  for  the  case  where  the  distinction  between 
real  and  imaginary  objects  is  not  made.  Kant  leaves  us  to  guess  his 
precise  meaning  from  the  context,  and  this  is  not  always  easy. 

3  By  the  synthesis  of  recognition  we  judge  the  combined  colours 
and  sounds  and  so  on  to  be  accidents  of  a  permanent  substance  in 
a  common  space  and  time. 


XIX  §  s]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  363 

at  all.  If  we  consider  sense-perception  in  abstraction  from 
thought,  Kant  holds  that  on  analysis  it  is  found  to  contain  both 
a  passive  and  an  active  element.  To  be  aware  even  of  a  colour 
we  require  not  only  passive  sense,  but  an  active  taking  up, 
running  through,  and  holding  together  of  what  is  passively 
received.  This  activity  of  imagination  is,  as  he  says,  a  necessary 
ingredient  in  sense-perception;1  and  I  cannot  see  that  we 
ought  to  recognise  any  further  element  of  activity  in  sense- 
perception — at  any  rate  not  on  the  level  of  common  sense 
or  even  of  science. 

§  3 .  The  Synthesis  of  Reproduction 

Apprehension  involves  more  than  'taking  up'  the  given 
at  the  moment  when  it  is  given.  Since  our  awareness  of  a 
colour,  and  still  more  our  awareness  of  a  concrete  object, 
is  a  process  which  occupies  time,2  we  must,  if  we  are  to  have 
experience  of  objects,  be  able  to  keep  before  our  minds  what 
has  been  given,  when  it  is  no  longer  being  given.  This  is  the 
work  of  memory,  without  which  there  could  be  no  knowledge. 
Memory,  however,  involves  thought  or  judgement,  and  this 
is  reserved  for  subsection  3.  The  first  thing  that  is  necessary — 
and  this  is  still  commonly  believed  to  be  a  necessary  element 
in  memory — is  a  power  of  reproducing  past  ideas  in  imagina- 
tion, which  Kant  regards  primarily  as  the  faculty  of  represent- 
ing an  object  even  when  that  object  is  not  present  to  us  in 
intuition.3 

If  we  are  to  be  aware  of  intuitions  (and  still  more  of  objects) 
lasting  through  time,  we  must  have  reproduction  of  past  ideas. 
The  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  inseparably  connected  with 
the  synthesis  of  reproduction.4  It  would,  I  think,  be  a  clearer 
statement  of  Kant's  doctrine,  if  we  said,  not  that  there  are  two

3  B    151.   Compare  A   100.   This  perhaps  could  be  stated  more 
clearly  by  omitting  reference  to  the  ambiguous  'object'.  Imagination 
reproduces  intuitions  which  are  no  longer  given  in  sensation.

inseparable  syntheses,  but  that  the  synthesis  of  apprehension 
includes  reproduction  as  a  necessary  element  within  itself. 

Now  awareness  of  pure  intuitions  (time  and  space)  is  also 
a  process  that  takes  time.  If  I  am  to  be  aware  of  a  number 
of  units,1  I  must  not  only  be  aware  of  each  unit;  I  must  keep 
them  in  mind,  or  reproduce  them,  as  I  go  on  to  the  other  units. 
Apart  from  such  reproduction  I  could  never  be  aware  of  a  total 
that  I  had  counted;  and  indeed  I  could  never  be  aware  of 
space  and  time,  for  they  also  are  made  up  of  parts  which 
I  must  know  one  after  another. 

The  pure  synthesis  of  the  apprehension  of  time  is  the  neces- 
sary condition  of  all  knowledge  (whether  empirical  or  pure), 
since  all  ideas  are  given  to  us  in  time.  Hence  the  pure2  syn- 
thesis of  the  reproduction  of  time  (as  inseparably  connected 
with  the  synthesis  of  apprehension)  is  also  a  necessary  con- 
dition of  all  knowledge.  The  pure  synthesis  of  reproduction 
and  the  pure  synthesis  of  apprehension  alike  belong  to  the 
transcendental3  acts  of  the  mind ;  and  we  are  entitled  to  speak 
of  the  transcendental  power  of  imagination,  since  imagination 
is  the  power  which  performs  these  acts.  The  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  a  necessary  condition  of  every 
empirical  synthesis. 

In  its  essentials  this  doctrine  is  present  everywhere  in  the 
Kritik,  but  with  one  important  modification.  Elsewhere,  both 
in  the  first  and  in  the  second  edition,  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  not  reproductive  but  productive.4 

It  is  this  striking  fact  which  (along  with  some  others  of  less 
importance)  inclines  me  to  the  belief  that  the  provisional 
exposition  may  represent  an  earlier5  level  of  reflexion,  and 

1  Other  examples  Kant  gives  are  the  parts  of  a  line,  and  the  divisions 
of  time  between  one  noon  and  another. 

2  Kant  does  not  say  expressly  here  that  this  synthesis  is  pure 
(though  this  should  be  obvious  from  the  context) ;  but  he  does  speak 
of  this  synthesis  as  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  in  A  101. 

8  Transcendental  acts  are  those  which  are  sources  of  a  priori  know- 
ledge and  conditions  of  all  experience.  4  A  118;  A  123;  B  152. 

5  Vaihinger's  view  (that  Kant  regarded  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination  first  as  productive,  and  then  as  reproductive,  and  finally 
again  as  productive)  seems  to  me  to  have  nothing  to  recommend  it. 


XIX  §  3]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  365 

perhaps  gives  us  the  line  of  thought  by  which  Kant  progressed 
to  his  conclusions.  He  himself  tells  us  that  imagination  was 
commonly  regarded  as  reproductive,1  and  this  part  of  the 
Deduction  seems  to  me  to  have  taken  its  start  from  the  Meta- 
physica  of  Baumgarten.2  While  it  is  barely  conceivable  that 
Kant  introduced  this  view  into  the  provisional  exposition 
in  order  to  conform  more  closely  to  the  probable  views  of  his 
readers,  it  is  much  more  likely  that  he  made  use  of  it  because 
it  was  a  view  which  he  had  at  one  time  held,  and  which  he  had 
perhaps  already  written  in  this  form.3 

The  two  doctrines  of  imagination  (as  reproductive  and  as 
productive)  are  not,  however,  so  different  as  might  seem 
at  first  sight.  In  both  cases  a  transcendental  synthesis  of  the 
pure  manifold  of  time  is  the  necessary  condition  of  all  know- 
ledge. 

Kant  was  perfectly  correct  in  supposing  that  a  pure  repro- 
ductive synthesis  was  necessary  for  knowledge  of  time.  There 
must  be  such  a  reproductive  synthesis,  and  it  must  be  pure, 
in  the  sense  that  the  manifold  synthetised  is  a  pure  manifold. 
The  reproduction,  however,  does  not  depend  upon  the  fact 
that  the  manifold  of  time  is  pure;  it  depends,  like  any  other 
reproduction,  upon  the  fact  that  we  tend  to  reproduce  in 
imagination  what  has  recently  been  before  our  minds  in  a 
particular  context.4  It  requires  only  a  step  to  see  that  the  pure 
synthesis  of  time  derives  its  transcendental  importance  from 

1  A  120  n. 

2  See  Proceedings  of  the  Aristotelian  Society,  Vol.  XXX,  p.  174  (1930). 
H.  J.  de  Vleeschauwer  in  La  deduction  transcendentale  has  recently 

shown  that  it  is  even  more  closely  connected  with  the  psychology 
of  Tetens.  He  has  also,  I  think,  proved  that  Kant's  whole  doctrine 
of  imagination  was  developed  in  the  years  immediately  preceding 
the  publication  of  the  Kritik. 

3  This  has  the  further  advantage  that,  if  there  are  any  reasons  for 
regarding  the  rest  of  the  argument  as  early — it  is  certainly  not  pre- 
Critical — the  provisional  exposition  can  be  treated  as  all  of  a  piece, 
which  in  my  opinion  it  undoubtedly  is. 

4  For  this  reason  it  might  even  be  regarded  as  (so  far)  empirical. 
Compare  A   n8  'the  reproductive  synthesis  rests  on  conditions  of 
experience*. 


366       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  4 

the  fact  that  time,  like  space,  can  be  constructed  a  priori*  and 
that  the  reproduction  involved  is  secondary.  There  is  no 
revolution  in  passing  from  reproductive  to  productive  (or 
constructive)  imagination,  and  the  second  doctrine  is  only 
a  more  adequate  expression  of  what  was  imperfectly  expressed 
in  the  first. 

I  believe  Kant's  reasoning  on  this  matter  to  be  fundamentally 
sound.  It  may  require  some  modification  in  the  light  of  the 
difficult  modern  theory  of  what  is  called  the  'specious  present*, 
but  I  do  not  think  that  this  theory  affects  the  soundness  of 
his  contention.2 

§  4.  Three  Kinds  of  Imagination 

So  far  Kant's  argument  is  simple,  and  even  obvious.  He 
is  saying  no  more  than  this,  that  if  we  are  to  be  aware  of  a 
succession  of  appearances  (or  ideas)  in  time,  we  must  be  able 
to  keep  before  the  mind  both  the  past  appearances  and  the 
past  time  in  which  they  appeared.3 

This  is,  in  the  first  instance,  the  work  of  reproductive 
imagination.  But  imagination,  according  to  Kant,4  is  of  three 
kinds.  Firstly,  there  is  plastic  imagination,  which  is  concerned 
with  making  images  or  figures  in  space*?  secondly,  there  is 
associative  imagination,  which  connects  ideas  in  time\  and 
thirdly,  there  is  imagination  which  connects  ideas  because 
of  their  kinship  or  affinity*  that  is,  because  they  are  derived 
from  a  common  ground.7  This  latter  kind  of  imagination 
helps  us  to  deal  with  a  single  theme,  whether  in  silent  reflexion 
or  in  conversation. 

1  For  this  reason  pure  synthesis  can  rest  upon  a  ground  of  synthetic 
a  priori  unity — see  A  78  =  B  104 — and  ultimately  upon  the  categories 
and  the  unity  of  apperception.  Compare  Chapter  XIII  §  6. 

2  See  Mind,  Vol.  XXXVIII,  N.S.  No.  151,  pp.  318  ff. 

8  This  requires  judgement  (or  memory)  as  well  as  reproduction, 
but  we  are  at  present  concerned  only  with  reproduction. 
*  Anthr.  §  31  (VII  174). 

6  When  this  imagination  is  uncontrolled  it  is  'phantasy*  (as  in 
dreams) ;  when  it  is  controlled  it  is  'composition*  (as  in  the  imagination 
of  the  artist).  See  Anthr.  §  31  A  (VII  175).  t'Verwandtschaft.' 

7  Anthr.  §  31  and  §  31  C  (VII  174  and  176). 


XIX  §  5]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  367 

It  may  be  thought  that  the  synthesis  of  reproduction  is  the 
work  of  associative  imagination,  which  connects  ideas  in  time. 
But  plastic  imagination  seems  also  to  be  concerned,  since 
space  is  involved  as  well  as  time,  and  the  business  of  imagina- 
tion (in  apprehension  and  reproduction)  is  to  make  a  picture 
or 'image.1  I  believe,  although  Kant  is  far  from  making  this 
clear,  that  he  has  in  mind  all  three  kinds  of  imagination ;  and 
of  the  three  it  is  the  imagination  determined  by  affinity  which 
is  the  most  important,  for  it  is  this  kind  of  imagination  which 
enables  us  to  associate  ideas  because  they  are  all  ideas  of  one 
object.2  As  Kant  himself  says,3  'The  ground  of  the  possibility 
of  the  association  of  ideas,  so  far  as  it  lies  in  the  object,  is  called 
the  affinity  of  the  manifold'.4 

If  we  keep  this  fact  in  mind,  much  that  seems  obscure  or 
arbitrary  in  Kant's  doctrine  will  become  intelligible. 

§  5.   Transcendental  Affinity 

Kant  complicates  his  exposition  of  the  synthesis  of  repro- 
duction by  introducing  a  doctrine  which  we  may  call  the 

1  A  120-1. 

2  Association  by  affinity  is  of  course  not  confined  to  the  association 
of  the  qualities  of  one  concrete  physical  object.  It  is  also  present  e.g. 
when  we  associate  the  units  we  have  just  counted  with  the  total  pro- 
duced by  counting. 

This  kind  of  association  seems  to  me  to  be  distinct  from  association 
by  contiguity  or  similarity,  and  to  be  clearly  a  factor  in  our  experience 
of  objects.  Such  association,  it  should  be  noted,  presupposes  the 
concept  of  an  object  in  general,  and  even  in  most  cases  the  concept 
of  the  special  kind  of  object  known.  It  therefore  could  not  mark 
a  stage  in  the  process  from  subjective  sensations  to  knowledge  of 
objects,  but  with  such  a  process  Kant  is  not  concerned.  We  shall 
find  later  that  the  whole  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  controlled  by 
thought  (as  well  as  by  what  is  given).  3  A  113. 

4  It  may  be  objected  that  in  this  passage  Kant  is  dealing  primarily 
with  association  in  virtue  of  causal  sequence,  and  that  Affinity*  is 
here  used  in  a  wider  sense  than  the  restricted  one  considered  here. 
Even  so,  I  think  the  terms  of  the  definition  are  interesting  as  showing 
some  connexion  between  the  doctrine  of  the  Anthropologie  and  that 
of  the  Kritik.  Moreover  it  must  be  remembered  that  for  Kant  causality 
itself  is  involved  in  the  nature  of  the  object  as  such. 


368       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XIX  §  5 

doctrine  of  transcendental  affinity*.1  This  doctrine  shows  the 
importance  of  the  pure  synthesis  of  imagination  by  explaining 
how  it  conditions  or  determines  the  empirical  synthesis. 

Every  philosopher  recognises,  in  some  form,  the  empirical 
law  of  the  association  of  ideas.  Ideas  which  habitually  follow, 
or  accompany,  one  another2  become  associated,  so  that  when 
one  of  these  ideas  is  present,  the  mind  commonly  passes  to, 
or  reproduces,  the  other.3  We  have  thus  a  power  of  repro- 
duction which  acts  according  to  a  fixed  rule.4 

This  power  of  reproduction  would  have  no  chance  of  being 
exercised,  unless  appearances  were  given  to  our  senses  in  a 
regular  order.  The  empirical  synthesis  of  reproduction  pre- 
supposes that  given  appearances  are  themselves  subject  to 
a  rule  or  law  in  accordance  with  which  they  follow  or  accom- 
pany one  another. 

The  examples  by  which  Kant  illustrates  this  point  are 
interesting,  for  they  suggest  that  he  is  thinking  mainly  about 
reproduction  through  affinity.  The  synthesis  of  reproduction 
would  be  impossible  if,  for  example,  cinnabar  were  now  red 
and  now  black,  now  light  and  now  heavy.  In  this  case  re- 
production would  seem  to  take  place  (as  it  commonly  does) 

1  A  114;  A  122 ;  A  766  =  B  794.  The  name  of  this  doctrine  is  not 
mentioned  in  A  100  ff.  nor  in  A  105-6  and  A  108,  where  it  seems  to 
be  implied. 

2  Kant  may  be  thinking  only  of  ideas  which  are  habitually  successive 
or  contemporaneous  in  time,  but  he  may  also  be  thinking  of  the  fact 
that  ideas  accompany  one  another  as  ideas  (or  appearances)  of  one 
object.  This  is  suggested  by  the  example  of  *  cinnabar'. 

8  A  100.  Compare  Anthr.  31  B  (VII  176).  Note  that  imagination 
here  (and  this  is  the  primary  characteristic  of  imagination)  can  work 
without  the  presence  of  the  object,  whereas  intuition — see,  for  example, 
ProL  §  8  (IV  281) — always  involves  the  presence  of  the  object.  Com- 
pare also  B  151  and  Anthr.  §  28  (VII  167).  Kant  sometimes  speaks 
of  intuition  loosely,  as  in  the  passage  from  the  Anthropologie,  where 
he  says  that  'Imagination  is  a  power  of  intuition,  even  without  the 
presence  of  the  object'.  It  is  unfortunate  that  he  has  no  special  word 
to  distinguish  the  ideas  or  images  of  imagination  from  the  intuitions 
which  contain  direct  sensation. 

4  'nach  einer  bestdndigen  RegeV  It  is  difficult  to  be  sure  how  far 
the  rule  is  really  'fixed'.  As  usually  formulated,  the  so-called  laws  of 
Association  seem  to  express  only  a  tendency. 


XIX  §  5]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  369 

because  we  believe  that  certain  qualities  or  appearances 
belong  to  one  object.  Such  association  is  distinct  from 
thinking,  and  need  not  involve  consciousness  of  the  rule  to 
which  it  conforms.1 

All  this  is  reasonable  enough,  but  it  seems  an  immense  leap 
yhen'Kant  goes  on  to  say,  not  only  that  something2  must  make 
this  reproduction  possible,  but  that  it  must  do  so  'because 
it  is  the  a  priori  ground  of  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  appear- 
ances'.3 

It  is  obvious  that  unless  there  were  some  regularity  in  given 
appearances,  there  could  be  no  association  of  ideas  through 
the  frequent  recurrence  of  similar  ideas  in  immediate  succes- 
sion.4 It  is  equally  obvious  that  any  attempt  to  infer  from  this 
a  necessary  law  of  cause  and  effect  governing  all  appearances 
would  be  as  fallacious  an  argument  as  one  could  wish  to  see. 
A  very  limited  degree  of  regularity  in  the  succession  of  appear- 
ances would  make  association  possible ;  and  even  if  regularity 
were  without  exceptions  in  our  experience,  this  would  be  far 
from  proving  that  the  regularity  was  necessary. 

If  Kant  is  thinking  especially  about  the  association  of  ideas 
through  affinity,  that  is,  through  their  connexion  with  one 
object,  such  an  association  could  not  take  place  unless  there 
were  objects  whose  given  characteristics  have  some  constancy 
and  coherence.  But  here  again  we  are  not  entitled  to  infer  that 

1  Anthr.  §  31  C  (VII  177).  Although  not  derived  from  understanding, 
it  takes  place  in  accordance  with  a  rule  of  understanding;  for  there 
would  be  no  object,  unless  the  understanding  thought  that  the  different 
appearances  were  appearances  of  one  object. 

8  A  101.  This  'something*  is,  I  think,  in  the  first  instance,  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  which  imposes  necessary 
synthetic  unity  on  appearances.  The  ultimate  ground  is  the  unity 
of  apperception.  See  A  101-2,  A  105,  and  A  122-3. 

8  This  necessary  synthetic  unity  is  manifested,  at  least  partially, 
in  the  fact  that  appearances  accompany  or  follow  one  another  in 
accordance  with  rules;  see  A  100. 

4  Or  simultaneously.  Kant  is,  however,  interested  in  immediate 
succession  because  of  its  connexion  with  causality,  and  he  does  not 
mention  simultaneity  when  he  formulates  the  law  of  association  (in 
the  narrow  sense  connected  with  associative  imagination).  Anthr. 
§31  B(VII  176). 


370       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XIX  §  5 

the  coherence  of  these  characteristics  in  the  object  is  a  necessary 
coherence. 

These  criticisms  would  be  conclusive  if  we  assumed  the 
doctrines  of  realism.  On  a  realistic  basis  the  observed  associa- 
tion of  ideas  will,  at  the  most,  lead  us  to  ask  whether  we  can 
prove  that  there  is  an  a  priori  ground  for  that  necessary  syn- 
thetic unity1  of  appearances2  which  seems  to  be  presupposed 
by  such  association.  The  proof  of  such  a  ground  cannot  in  any 
case  depend  on  the  contention  that  without  necessary  syn- 
thetic unity  of  appearances  there  would  be  no  such  association 
of  ideas  as  we  find  in  experience.  If  we  are  to  prove  that  there 
is  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  appearances,  we  must — as  in 
the  proof  of  any  kind  of  necessity — show  that  it  has  its  origin, 
or  a  priori  ground,  in  the  nature  of  the  mind.  The  possibility 
of  finding  such  a  ground  rests  on  the  doctrine  which  Kant 
conceives  himself  to  have  already  established:  that  given 
appearances,  or  phenomena,  are  not  things-in-themselves, 
but  are  only  the  play  of  our  own  ideas,  and  can  be  re- 
duced to  determinations  of  inner  sense.8  This  means  that 
they  must  necessarily  conform  to  time,  as  the  form  of  inner 
sense. 

If  we  can  show  that  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination  is  necessary  for  knowledge  of  time  (and  space),4 
this  will  imply,  according  to  Kant,  not  only  that  there  must 
be  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  time  (and  space),  but  also 
that  there  must  be  a  synthetic  unity,  or  transcendental  affinity, 
of  appearances  in  time  (and  space).5  As  I  have  already  shown 
that  there  must  be  such  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of 

1  We  can  describe  this  as  'transcendental  affinity*,  and  take  it  to 
cover  both  the  necessary  regularity  and  the  necessary  coherence  of 
which  I  have  spoken  above. 

2  For  the  realist  'appearances'  would  be  'things  appearing'. 

3  A  101. 

4  The  presence  of  space  in  this  argument  as  well  as  time  is  typical 
of  Kant's  argument  throughout  in  spite  of  his  insistence  on  the 
special  importance  of  time. 

6  This  is  what  Kant  claims  to  prove  in  the  Principles,  and  especially 
in  the  Analogies,  but  he  seems  to  assume  it  here. 


XIX  §  6]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  371 

imagination,1  the  argument  is  now  complete;2  but  we  must 
consider  Kant's  own  exposition  a  little  more  closely. 

§  6.  The  Pure  Transcendental  Synthesis  of  Reproduction 

The  ^  sentence  in  which  Kant  expresses  the  crucial  stage 
of  his  argument3  is  unfortunately  intricate,  and  leaves  many 
gaps  to  be  filled  in.  I  will  try  to  deal  in  my  own  way  with 
the  elements  of  which  it  is  composed.  When  the  reader  has 
grasped  the  relation  of  these  elements  to  one  another,  he  will 
be  able  to  follow  Kant's  general  meaning  in  spite  of  the  awk- 
wardness with  which  it  is  expressed. 

Kant  assumes  that  experience  presupposes  the  reproduci- 
bility  of  appearances.4  He  takes  this  to  mean  that  it  presupposes 
the  possibility  of  a  'thorough-going*  synthesis  of  reproduction, 
that  is,  of  one  which  rests,  not  on  occasional  conjunctions 
of  the  given,  but  on  necessary  and  universal  conjunctions; 
or  in  other  words  on  necessary  synthetic  unity  (or  transcen- 
dental affinity).  If  there  is  such  a  necessary  synthetic  unity 
in  given  appearances,  it  must  have  an  a  priori  ground  in  the 
nature  of  the  mind.  Let  us  suppose  that  this  a  priori  ground 
is  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of  the  imagination5  which 
combines  the  pure  manifold  of  time  (and  space). 

So  far  we  have  a  provisional  analysis  which  attempts  to 

1  See  §  3  above.  Whether  we  regard  this  transcendental  synthesis 
as  productive  or  reproductive  is,  as  I  have  said,  of  minor  importance. 
It  is  properly  regarded  as  productive,  but  in  this  passage  Kant  describes 
it  as  reproductive.  This  may  be  the  source  of  his  obscure  statements 
about  'necessary  reproduction1  in  A  105-6. 

2  In  the  Kritik  der  Urteilskraft,  EM.  V  (V  181-6)-— and  especially 
in  the  'Erste  Einleitung*  IV  (Phil.  Bib.  3QC,  pp.  15-18) — Kant  seems 
to  recognise  that  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  proved  in  the  Kritik 
der  reinen  Vernunft  does  not   by  itself  guarantee  that  homogeneity 
and  regularity  which  we  all  assume  to  be  present  in  nature.  I  doubt 
whether  he  was  aware  of  this  when  he  wrote  the  present  argument. 

8 The  last  sentence  of  A  101 ;  in  Kemp  Smith's  translation:  'For 
if  we  can  show  .  .  .  reproducibility  of  experience*. 

4  I  am  beginning  with  the  end  of  the  sentence,  where  it  overlaps 
into  A  102. 

5  This  in  turn  is  grounded  in  the  unity  of  apperception. 


372       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  6 

discover,  by  a  regressive  argument,  where  we  are  likely  to  find 
the  conditions  of  experience.  If  we  are  to  justify  our  view 
of  these  conditions,  we  must  proceed  by  a  progressive  argu- 
ment.1 This  we  are  now  in  a  position  to  do. 

Kant  believes  he  has  proved  that  time  (and  in  some  degree 
space)  are  conditions  of  experience,  and  that  appearances  are 
not  things-in-themselves,  but  mere  ideas,  which  as  such  must 
necessarily  conform  to  time,  the  form  of  inner  sense.  Hence 
all  he  has  to  show,  at  the  present  stage  of  the  argument,  is  that 
a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  necessary  for 
knowledge  of  time  (and  space) ;  or  in  other  words  that  without 
such  a  transcendental  synthesis  we  could  not  represent  the 
pure  manifold  of  time  (and  space)  as  a  manifold  or  have  one 
whole  idea  of  time  and  space  as  possessing  necessary  synthetic 
unity.  He  assumes  that  this  transcendental  synthesis  will 
impose  necessary  synthetic  unity2  on  the  empirical  manifold 
given  in  time  (and  space),  and  in  this  way  will  make  a  thorough- 
going synthesis  of  empirical  reproduction  (and  therefore 
experience  itself)  possible.3 

Kant  then  shows — on  the  ground  that  it  takes  time  for  us 
to  apprehend  a  pure  manifold  as  a  whole,  or  as  combined 
in  one  idea — that  a  pure  reproductive  synthesis  of  imagination 
is  necessary,  if  we  are  to  know  a  line,  or  the  time  from  one  noon 
to  another,  or  a  definite  number,  and  even  if  we  are  to  know 
time  and  space  themselves.  The  pure  reproductive  synthesis 

1  See  Chapter  VI  §  2. 

2  This  has  already  been  asserted  in  A  79  =  B  104.  Kant  makes  his 
argument  more  difficult  to  follow  by  speaking,  not  about  *  necessary 
synthetic  unity',  but  about  'such  a  combination  of  the  manifold  as 
makes  a  thorough-going  synthesis  of  reproduction  possible*.  I  take 
'combination*  here  as  equivalent  to  'necessary  synthetic  unity'.  There 
is  a  further  difficulty  in  the  fact  that  he  leaves  it  to  us  to  make  the 
connexion  between  such  'combination'  and  the  pure  transcendental 
synthesis  of  the  imagination,  which  is  mentioned  later  in  the  sentence. 

8  He  also  assumes  that  the  thorough-going  synthesis  of  reproduction, 
since  it  has  its  ground  in  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  imposed  by 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  will  be  grounded  on  the 
a  priori  principles  which  are  bound  up  with  this  necessary  synthetic 
unity.  These  principles  are  primarily  the  Analogies  of  Experience. 
Compare  'a  priori  rules  of  synthetic  unity*  in  A  no. 


XIX  §  6]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  373 

of  imagination  is  therefore  a  condition  of  all  experience  and 
all  knowledge,  and  is  properly  described  as  transcendental.1 

Kant's  exposition  is  awkward,  and  for  this  reason  I  have 
considered  his  argument  in  a  different  order,  not  only  at  the 
crucial  stage,  but  throughout  the  subsection  as  a  whole.  Never- 
theless.no  part  of  the  argument  is  to  be  regarded  as  a  digression.2 
There  would  be  little  point  in  insisting  on  the  necessity  for 
a  pure  synthesis  of  reproduction,  unless  it  were  also  shown 
that  this  synthesis  is  a  source  of  necessary  synthetic  unity; 
and  in  view  of  Hume's  doctrines  it  was  very  important  for  Kant 
to  distinguish  clearly  between  an  empirical  synthesis  of  repro- 
duction and  the  transcendental  synthesis  which  is  its  con- 
dition.3 

In  this  complicated  exposition  I  have  followed  what  I  believe 
to  be  the  orthodox  translation  and  interpretation.  Nevertheless 
it  seems  to  me  that  another  translation  and  interpretation  is 
possible;  for  in  the  clause  'die  eine  durchgdngige  Synthesis  der 
Reproduktion  moglich  macht\  'die'  may  be  the  object,  and  not 
the  subject.  On  this  translation  Kant's  argument  is  as  follows : 
if  we  could  show  that  even  our  purest  a  priori  intuitions  give 
us  no  knowledge  except  in  so  far  as  they  contain  a  combination 
which  is  made  possible  by  a  thorough-going  synthesis  of  repro- 
duction, then  this  synthesis  of  reproduction  (since  it  is  a  pure 
synthesis)  is  grounded  on  a  priori  principles  independently 
of  experience,  and  must  be  supposed  to  be  a  pure  transcen- 
dental synthesis  and  a  condition  of  the  possibility  of  experience. 

This  version  is  simpler,  for  only  one  synthesis  (the  pure 
transcendental  synthesis  of  reproduction)  is  in  question;  and 
it  seems  to  describe  better  what  Kant  goes  on  to  prove,  namely 
that  apart  from  a  pure  synthesis  of  reproduction  we  cannot 

1  Compare  §  3  above. 

8  Nor  do  I  think  it  necessary  to  hold  with  Adickes  that  the  awkward- 
ness in  this  and  other  cases  must  be  due  to  a  later  insertion.  Why 
should  we  assume  that  the  first  draft  of  an  argument  is  likely  to  be 
the  most  clear  ? 

3  Compare  A  115-16  and  A  766  =  B  794.  This  was  all  the  more 
important  when  Kant  was  himself  describing  the  transcendental 
synthesis  as  reproductive.

have  a  whole  idea  of  a  line  or  a  period  of  time  or  indeed  of  the 
one  time  (and  space)  which  is  a  condition  of  experience — the 
whole  idea  being  'an  intuition  which  contains  combination9. 
If  we  object  that  Kant  assumes  without  argument  that  a  pure 
synthesis  of  time  and  space  will  impose  necessary  synthetic 
unity,  and  so  reproducibility,  upon  appearances,  this  objection 
applies  equally  to  the  orthodox  view. 

I  believe  that  this  interpretation  finds  some  support  in  A  123, 
and  on  the  whole  I  am  inclined  to  think  it  is  the  correct  one. 

§  7.  The  Synthesis  of  Recognition 

We  already  know  that  our  synthesis  of  imagination  has 
to  be  brought  to  concepts  by  understanding.1  This  doctrine 
Kant  seeks  to  make  more  explicit  in  dealing  with  what  is  here 
called  the  synthesis  of  recognition  in  the  concept. 

The  example  by  which  Kant  seeks  to  make  his  meaning 
clear  is  the  act  of  counting.  This  is  presumably  a  pure  syn- 
thesis,2 that  is  to  say,  the  counting  is  concerned  with  abstract 
units,  and  not  with  concrete  things  like  sheep  or  goats.  His 
argument  applies,  however,  both  to  pure  and  to  empirical 
synthesis;  and,  as  we  have  seen,  an  empirical  synthesis  always 
involves  a  pure  synthesis  as  well. 

If  we  are  counting  up  to,  say,  twenty,  we  must  remember 
(or  recognise)  that  the  units  which  we  finally  think  of  as  twenty 
are  the  same  as  the  units  which  we  have  counted  on  our  way 
to  this  total.  Kant  regards  this,  rightly  or  wrongly,  as  involving 
the  reproduction  of  the  units  in  imagination;  but  the  really 
important  point  is  his  contention  that  in  order  to  count  up  to 
twenty  units  we  must  recognise,  not  only  that  the  twenty  units 
are  the  units  we  have  counted,  but  also  that  the  total  is  produced 
by  one  act  of  counting,  that  is,  by  the  successive  addition  of 
unit  to  unit. 

1  A  78  =  B  103 ;  compare  A  78  =  B  104.  See  also  Chapter  XIII  §  5. 

2  As  in  A  1 02.  Even  in  A  99  the  example  he  gives  in  connexion  with 
the  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  the  idea  of  space.  His  main  interest  is 
directed  to  pure  synthesis,  because  it  is  through  the  pure  synthesis 
of  time  (and  space)  that  the  categories  are  imposed  upon  objects. 


XIX  §  7]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  375 

Such  recognition  involves  the  presence  of  concepts.1  In 
particular  it  involves  the  concept  of  'number',  which  Kant 
regards  as  the  concept  of  the  successive  addition  of  homo- 
geneous units  to  one  another.2  To  recognise  that  this  is  the 
number  twenty,  we  must  have  a  concept  of  the  general  char- 
acter of  the  synthesis  by  which  number  is  produced.  That 
is  to  say,  we  must  be  conscious,  however  dimly,8  of  the  char- 
acter or  the  rule  of  the  synthesis  and  so  of  its  unity.  These 
phrases  are  treated  by  Kant  as  if  they  were  identical  in  mean- 
ing ;4  and  he  asserts  here  that  the  concept  of  'number'  consists 
in  consciousness5  of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis.6 

We  can  now  state  Kant's  position  more  generally.  In  order 
to  recognise  any  object  as  an  object,  we  must  unite  in  one  idea 
the  manifold  which  we  have  (i)  intuited  in  successive  moments, 
and  (2)  reproduced  in  imagination;7  and  this  means  that  we 
must,  in  one  act  of  consciousness,  be  aware  of  the  unity  of  the 
synthesis  whereby  the  manifold  is  combined  into  one  object.  Such 
awareness  Kant  describes  as  'recognition8  in  the  concept'.  Were 
it  not  for  this  power  of  recognition,  mere  reproduction  would  be 
useleag.  We  might  have  a  variety  of  intuitions  'hovering'  before 
us  at  any  moment,  but  we  should  be  unable  to  identify  them 

1  It  involves  the  concept  of  'unit*,   all  units  being  regarded  as 
homogeneous  with  one  another;  see  A  142  =  B  182.  It  also  involves 
the  concept  of  the  decad — we  know  that  we  have  grasped  the  added 
units  in  two  sets  of  ten;  see  A  78  =  B  104.  I  take  it  that  the  concept 
'twenty'  is  also  involved,  although  the  proposition  in  which  the  result 
is  expressed  is  a  singular  proposition;  see  A  164-5  =  B  205-6. 

2  Compare  A  142  =  B  182.  Here  as  usual  Kant  identifies  the  concept 
of  what  is  produced  by  the  synthesis  with  the  concept  of  the  synthesis 
itself.  3  This  qualification  will  be  explained  in  §  8  below. 

4  Compare  Chapter  XIII  §  7. 

5  This,  I  think,  involves  some  degree  of  self-consciousness. 

6  It  should  be  noted  that  the  judgement  which  makes  use  of  the 
concept  of  'number'  is  in  some  degree  making  explicit  the  rule  which 
is  at  work  in  the  synthesis  of  imagination  and  which  gives  that 
synthesis  its  unity;  see  Chapter  XIII  §  5.  It  should  also  be  noted  that 
number  is  the  schema  of  the  pure  category  of  quantity;  see  A  142  = 
B  182.  In  applying  particular  concepts  we  are  also,  consciously  or 
unconsciously,  applying  the  categories.  7  See  A  103. 

8  The  word  'recognition'  presumably  implies  that  reproduction  and 
memory  are  involved. 


376       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XIX  §  7 

with  anything  that  went  before,1  or  to  find  in  them  that  unity 
without  which  they  would  not  constitute  an  individual  whole. 

Kant  is  clearly  right  in  holding  that  unity  in  consciousness 
and  unity  in  the  object  are  correlative,  and  that  unless  con- 
sciousness grasps  the  given  elements  together,  these  will  not 
form  one  object  for  us.  The  interesting  part  of  his  doctrine 
is  that  such  *  grasping'  involves,  not  only  one  synthesis  of  the 
imagination,  but  also  consciousness,  however  elementary,  of  the 
character  of  this  synthesis,  and  so  of  the  rule  which  is  at  work 
in  it  and  is  the  source  of  its  unity.  To  say  this  is  to  say  that  for 
knowledge  of  an  object  we  require  a  concept  of  the  synthesis 
whereby  the  manifold  is  combined  in  one  idea  or  intuition.2 
Such  a  concept — and  this  is  definitely  Kant's  doctrine — 
implies  some  degree  of  self-consciousness.3 

Kant's  own  summary4  of  his  theory  shows  quite  clearly  that 
we  are  dealing  with  only  one  synthesis,  and  not  with  three. 
Apart  from  the  addition  that  imagination  is  reproductive,  it  is 
identical  with  the  doctrine  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction.5 
It  prepares  the  way  for  the  unity  of  apperception,  and  for  the 
doctrine  that  there  is  no  object  (as  distinct  from  given  impres- 
sions) without  concepts  or  without  judgement.6 

In  this  argument  there  are  three  main  questions  which 
require  further  elucidation  before  we  can  go  on  to  consider 
the  part  played  by  the  categories.  These  are  (i)  the  nature 
of  an  'object',  (2)  the  nature  of  a  'concept',  and  (3)  the  nature 
of  'unity  of  consciousness'.  It  is  these  questions  with  which 
Kant  now  proceeds  to  deal.7 

1  This  fact  is,  I  think,  sometimes  forgotten  in  modern  discussions 
about  memory.  Compare  my  article  in  Mind,  Vol.  XXXVIII,  N.S. 
No.  15 1 ,  pp.  320  ff. 

2  Kant  even  asserts  that  the  word  'Begriff*  (concept)  itself  suggests 
consciousness  of  the  unity  of  synthesis — presumably  because  'begreifen' 
(to  conceive  or  understand)  is  to  'grasp  together*  or  'comprehend*. 

8  Animals  cannot  have  concepts  because  they  have  no  self- 
consciousness ;  compare  Nachlass  411  (XV  166). 

4  In  A  103.  6  A  77-9  =  B  103-4.  6  A  104. 

7  In  spite  of  this  Vaihinger  alleges  that  Kant  at  this  point  (A  104) 
introduces  notes  belonging  to  a  pre- Critical  period,  and  entirely 
irrelevant  to  the  argument! 


XIX  §  8]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  377 

Before  we  consider  these,  there  are  some  points  which 
require  to  be  cleared  up. 

§  8.  Clear  and  Obscure  Ideas 

It  would  be  absurd  to  suppose  that  in  knowing  objects 
we  always  make  clear  to  our  minds  the  concepts  employed, 
and  still  more  absurd  to  suppose  that  we  consciously  recognise 
these  concepts  to  involve  the  unity  of  our  act  of  synthesis.1 
Kant  meets  this  difficulty  by  his  doctrine  that  ideas  may  be 
either  clear  or  obscure. 

When  an  idea  is  present  to  our  minds  as  different  from  other 
ideas  it  is  a  clear  idea.  When  the  elements  of  which  it  is  com- 
posed are  also  clear,  the  idea  is  a  distinct  idea.  The  opposite  of 
'clear'  is  'obscure',  and  the  opposite  of  'distinct'  is  properly 
'indistinct',  although  in  common  philosophical  usage  it  is 
'confused'.  We  make  our  clear  ideas  distinct  by  means  of 
analysis.2 

Since  an  obscure  idea  is  not  present  to  our  minds  as  different 
from  other  ideas,  it  may  be  said  to  be  an  unconscious  idea.3 
This  is  a  paradox,  and  Locke,  in  his  attack  upon  innate  ideas, 
rejected  the  existence  of  unconscious  ideas.  It  is,  however, 
possible  to  be  mediately  conscious  of  an  idea,  without  being 
immediately  conscious  of  it.  Obscure  ideas  are  those  of  which 
we  are  mediately  conscious.4  We  are  not  immediately  aware 
of  them,  but  they  are  involved  in  ideas  of  which  we  are  im- 
mediately aware. 

1  For  example,  in  counting  up  to  twenty  we  need  not  make  clear 
to  ourselves  that  we  are  employing  the  concept  of  *  number',  much 
less  that  the  concept  of  number  is,  or  involves,  the  concept  of  the 
unity  of  the  synthesis  whereby  we  successively  add  homogeneous 
units  to  one  another.  Nevertheless  we  must  be  dimly  aware  of  the 
character  of  what  we  are  doing,  for  otherwise  we  should  not  know 
that  we  had  before  us  twenty  units. 

For  the  obscurity  of  the  concept  see  also  A  106.

378       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XIX  §  8 

That  is  to  say  (and  it  is,  I  suggest,  true),  there  may  be  ideas 
implicit  in  our  consciousness  which  we  have  not  yet  made 
explicit,  and  there  are  different  degrees  in  which  we  make  our 
ideas  explicit.  This  is  obvious,  for  example,  as  regards  the 
laws  of  thought,  which  are  presupposed  by  our  thinking  long 
before  we  make  them  clear  to  our  own  minds ;  but  it  is  true 
also  both  of  such  concepts  as  are  at  work  in  recognition  and 
of  the  unity  of  consciousness  which  they  imply. 

According  to  Kant  the  concept  of  an  object  implies  conscious- 
ness of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis  without  which  the  object 
cannot  be  known;  and  this  consciousness  must  itself  be  one 
consciousness.1  Such  consciousness  may  be  faint  (or  obscure) 
in  various  degrees.  We  may  connect  it  with  the  production 
of  the  idea  of  the  object  only  in  its  effect,  and  not  in  the  act 
of  synthesis  itself,  that  is,  not2  immediately.3  In  other  words, 
in  the  act  of  synthetising  an  object,  we  may  not  be  immediately 
aware  of  the  unity  of  consciousness  (or  even  of  the  concept)4 
which  is  necessarily  involved.  The  fact  that  such  unity  of 
consciousness  must  be  involved  can,  however,  be  discovered 
by  considering  the  effect  of  our  act  of  synthetising,  namely, 
that  an  object  is  known.  If  we  know  an  object,  then,  as  Kant 
says,  one  consciousness  (or  unity  of  consciousness)  must 
always  be  present,  although  it  may  lack  clarity5  and  may  not 
stand  out6  among  the  ideas  of  which  we  are  aware ;  and  without 
this  one  consciousness  (whether  clear  or  obscure)  there  can 
be  neither  concepts  nor  any  knowledge  of  an  object. 

More  simply,  this  consciousness  of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis 

1  This  is  clearly  a  kind  of  self-consciousness. 

2  Kant  omits  the  word  'not'  which  is  implied  after  'that  is*.  This 
seems  to  be  a  Kantian  idiom ;  see  B  72  'well  sie  nicht  ursprunglich,  d.i. 
eine  solche  ist  .  .  . '.  Kemp  Smith's  translation  inserts  the  'not'  which 
is  required  in  English:  'it  is  not  original,  that  is,  is  not  such  .   .   .'. 

3  The  emendation  of  Adickes  seems  to  me  to  obscure,  rather  than 
to  clarify,  Kant's  meaning.  See  Raymund  Schmidt  and  Kemp  Smith's 
translation.  4  Compare  A  106. 

5  Not  merely  'distinctness*  as  Professor  Kemp  Smith's  translation 
suggests.  It  is  not  separated  out  from  other  elements  in  the  experience.

XIX  §  Q]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  379 

may  be  obscure  in  varying  degrees.  It  may  not  be  immediately 
present  to  our  minds,  but  a  reflective  analysis  of  the  ideas 
immediately  present  to  our  minds  will  indicate  that  it  must 
be  present.1 

All  this  is,  it  must  be  admitted,  full  of  difficulties.  Never- 
theless1 unity  of  consciousness  is  clearly  necessary  for  know- 
ledge of  any  complex  object  whose  parts  are  successively 
apprehended.  How  far  we  are  aware  of  this  unity  of  conscious- 
ness, that  is,  how  far  we  are  self-conscious,  may  vary  greatly 
in  degree,2  but  we  can  always  become  aware  of  this  unity 
by  reflective  analysis.  The  relation  between  concepts  and  unity 
of  consciousness  is  less  obvious,  but  the  concept  of  any  object 
is  certainly  impossible  apart  from  unity  of  consciousness: 
it  is  perhaps  impossible  even  without  some  awareness,  however 
dim,  of  this  unity  of  consciousness  as  manifested  in  the  syn- 
thesis whereby  we  combine  the  manifold  into  one  object ;  and 
this  means  that  it  is  impossible  apart  from  some  awareness 
of  the  character  (or  rule)  of  the  synthesis  whereby  we  combine 
the  manifold  into  one  object.  The  fact  that  we  do  not  ordinarily 
separate,  or  make  clear,  these  different  elements  in  our  experi- 
ence of  objects  is  in  any  case  irrelevant  to  the  correctness 
or  incorrectness  of  Kant's  analysis. 

§  9.  Empirical  and  Transcendental  Apperception 

If  Kant  had  possessed  a  tidy  mind,  he  would  have  pointed 
out  (what  is  sufficiently  obvious)  that  recognition  in  the  concept 
involves  understanding  or  apperception.  He  would  also  have 
asked  whether  there  is  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of 
recognition  as  well  as  an  empirical  one ;  for  in  this  way  alone, 
it  would  seem,  can  the  parallelism  of  the  threefold  synthesis 
be  complete.  His  failure  to  deal  with  these  points  and  his 
slowness  in  coming  to  the  distinction  between  empirical  and 

1  This  doctrine  is  stated  more  fully  in  A  117  n.  Compare  B  132-3 
and  B  134.  For  'clarity*  see  also  A  196  ==  B  241. 

a  I  should  imagine  that  in  counting  up  to  twenty  there  is  usually 
a  considerable  degree  of  self-consciousness:  we  know  what  we  are 
doing,  even  if  our  attention  is  not  directed  to  our  act,  but  to  its  results. 


380        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XIX  §  9 

transcendental  apperception1  have  led  Vaihinger  to  maintain  that 
the  rest  of  subsection  3  has  no  connexion  with  what  goes  before. 
Yet  it  is  one  thing  to  recognise  that  Kant's  argument  is  untidy, 
and  quite  another  to  maintain  that  it  is  not  an  argument  at  all. 

There  can  be  no  reasonable  doubt  that  in  addition  to  em- 
pirical recognition  by  means  of  empirical  concepts  there  is  also 
pure  recognition  by  means  of  pure  concepts — the  illustration 
from  counting  is  itself  an  example  of  this.2  The  transcendental 
importance  of  recognition  does  not,  however,  depend  upon  the 
fact  that  in  some  judgements  we  employ  pure  mathematical 
concepts  as  opposed  to  empirical  ones.  It  depends  upon  the 
fact  that  in  all  recognition  and  in  all  judgement  there  must 
be  unity  of  thought  and  awareness  (clear  or  obscure)  of  this 
unity.3  The  empirical  manifold  given  to  sense  is  conditioned 
by  the  form  of  time  (and  space) ;  the  empirical  synthesis  of  the 
given  manifold  is  conditioned  by  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  time  (and  space) ;  and  the  recognition  of  the  empirical  object 
and  of  the  complex  synthesis  by  which  it  is  combined  is  con- 
ditioned by  the  unity  of  thought  or  of  self-consciousness. 
Hence  Kant  ignores  the  difference  between  empirical  and  pure 
recognition,  and  discusses  instead  the  difference  between 
empirical  and  transcendental  apperception — transcendental 
apperception  being  the  ultimate  condition  of  all  recognition 
and  the  source  of  the  forms  of  thought.4 

1  See  A  107. 

2  Compare  §  6  above.  Every  mathematical  judgement  is  an  example 
of  pure  recognition. 

3  Kant  believes  this  is  necessary  to  conception  and  judgement  as  such. 

4  The  view  taken  in  this  paragraph  is  borne  out  by  Kant's  own 
summary  of  the  provisional  exposition  in  A  115.  There  the  three 
subjective  sources  of  knowledge  are  said  to  be  sense,  imagination, 
and  apperception — the  only  three  which  Kant  ever  mentions,  if  (as 
even  Vaihinger  admits)  apperception  as  a  power  can  be  identified 
with  understanding.  This  passage  displays  Kant's  usual  carelessness 
in  terminology,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  empirical  apperception 
is  manifested  in  recognition,  recognition  being  identified  with  'empirical 
consciousness  of  the  identity  of  the  ideas  reproduced  with  the  appear- 
ances through  which  these  ideas  were  originally  given*.  I  take  it  that 
such  recognition  would  cover  the  case  where  the  manifold  reproduced 
was  itself  pure. 


XIX  §  9]  THE  THREEFOLD  SYNTHESIS  381 

To  the  distinction  between  empirical  and  transcendental 
apperception  we  shall  come  in  due  course.  We  must  not, 
however,  forget  that  transcendental  apperception,  although  it 
is  the  condition  of  all  recognition  (including  empirical  recog- 
nition), is  not  a  condition  under  which  the  empirical  manifold 
is  given.  The  empirical  manifold  must  conform  to  the  unity 
of  apperception  only  because  the  empirical  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion must  conform  to  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion; and  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  can 
conform  to  the  unity  of  apperception,  and  so  to  the  forms 
of  thought,  only  because  it  is  a  pure  synthesis.1 

1  As  a  pure  synthesis  it  rests  upon  a  ground  of  synthetic  a  priori 
unity — see  A  79  =  B  104;  as  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  it  has 
its  ground  in  the  unity  of  apperception  (and  the  categories),  and  it 
imposes  necessary  synthetic  unity  upon  the  pure  manifold  of  time 
(and  space),  and  consequently  upon  the  empirical  manifold  given 
under  the  form  of  time  (and  space) — compare  A  118,  A  123,  B  151-2. 
See  also  Chapter  XIII  §  6,  and  §  3  of  the  present  chapter.  This  view 
has  at  least  a  show  of  plausibility  if  we  regard  the  transcendental 
synthesis  as  essentially  productive. 


CHAPTER    XX 
THE   OBJECT  AND   THE   CONCEPT 

§  i.  Kant's  Method  of  Exposition 

Instead  of  passing  straight  from  empirical  recognition  (or 
empirical  apperception)  to  transcendental  apperception  (and 
the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception),  and  from  transcen- 
dental apperception  to  the  object  and  the  categories,  Kant 
makes  a  break  in  the  argument,  and  deals  at  first  with  the 
nature  of  the  object  which  is  known  in  recognition.  In  this 
he  is  doing  what  he  did  in  regard  to  transcendental  affinity. 
He  is  leading  us,  by  a  provisional  and  regressive  (or  analytic) 
argument,  to  the  position  where  we  can  follow  the  progressive 
(or  synthetic)  argument  on  which  his  doctrine  is  based.1 
This  method  of  exposition  has  been  severely  criticised  by 
many  commentators.  It  is  certainly  awkward,  but  it  does  not 
appear  to  me  to  be  unreasonable. 

Kant's  exposition  may  be  criticised  more  generally  on  the 
ground  that  an  account  of  the  object  ought  to  have  been  given 
long  ago.  The  absence  of  such  an  account  has  certainly  led 
to  difficulties  of  interpretation,  but  he  may  have  thought  we 
were  not  in  a  position  to  grasp  his  meaning  till  we  had  under- 
stood the  theory  of  synthesis ;  and  again  he  may  have  intended 
to  lead  us  gradually  from  the  assumptions  of  common  sense 
to  the  central  doctrine  of  the  Critical  Philosophy. 

The  awkwardness  of  Kant's  methods  in  exposition  makes  it 
the  more  necessary  for  us  to  follow,  if  we  can,  the  connexion 
between  the  different  parts  of  his  argument.  I  can  see  no 
reason  for  holding — with  Vaihinger  and  Kemp  Smith — that 
the  present  account  of  the  nature  of  the  object  in  its  relation 
to  the  unity  of  apperception  is  irrelevant  to  a  transcendental 
deduction  of  the  categories.2 

1  See  Chapter  VI  §  2  and  Chapter  XIX  §  6. 

2  It  should  be  noted  that  in  the  version  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction  given  in  the  second  edition   Kant  again  discusses  the 


XX  §  2]        THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  383 

§2.  The  Object 

Kant  starts  his  account  of  the  object1  with  what  he  calls 
'appearances'.  These  are  described  as  'sensuous  ideas',  and 
they  might  also  be  described  as  'intuitions'.2  He  seems  to 
have  in  mind,  not  mere  sensa  such  as  colours  or  sounds,  but 
the  complex  'image'  in  which  such  sensa  are  combined.  In  other 
words  he  is  concerned  with  the  individual  ideas  in  which, 
as  we  have  just  learnt,3  consciousness  unites  the  manifold 
which  has  been  intuited  and  reproduced.  He  is  concerned, 
for  example,  with  the  appearance  or  intuition  or  idea  of  this 
white  house.4 

Kant's  analysis  so  far  has  led  him  to  the  view  that  the 
appearance  of  this  white  house  (which  I  know  by  means  of 
apprehension,  reproduction,  and  recognition)  is  an  idea  which 
is  real  as  a  modification  of  my  mind,  but  is  not  itself  a  real 
object  (or  thing)  independently  of  my  mind.5  Such  an  account, 
however,  is  incomplete.  We  believe  that  our  idea  is  an  idea 
of  a  real  object;  and  this  seems  to  imply  that  there  is  a  real 
object  which  corresponds  to  my  idea,  and  which  consequently 
must  be  different  from  my  idea.  The  question  therefore  arises 
whether  we  can  attach  any  meaning  to  this  contention,  if  we 
hold,  as  Kant  does,  that  what  we  are  given  is  only  ideas,6  and 

nature  of  the  object  and  the  unity  of  apperception  before  he  comes 
to  the  categories  in  B  143.  He  has  every  right  to  reserve  his  considera- 
tion of  the  categories  till  he  has  dealt  adequately  with  the  present 
topics,  and  it  cannot  be  said  that  he  devotes  too  much  attention  to 
them :  it  might  more  reasonably  be  said  that  he  does  not  devote  enough. 

1A  104  ff.  This  account  should  be  compared  with  A  189-91  = 
B  234-6,  A  197  =  B  242-3,  and  B  137. 

2  See  A  105  and  B  162.  8  A  103. 

4  The  same  type  of  problem  arises  if  we  ask  what  is  our  justification 
for  saying  that  this  white,  which  we  see  and  which  as  a  modification 
of  our  mind  is  an  idea,  is  the  colour  of  a  real  object. 

6  Such  ideas  are  appearances  of  things-in- themselves,  and  their 
elements  are  not  made  by  my  mind,  but  are  given  to  me  through 
the  influence  of  things-in-themselves.  Nevertheless  without  some 
human  mind  they  could  not  exist,  and  they  are  not  to  be  regarded 
as  things-in-themselves. 

6  What  we  are  given  is,  strictly  speaking,  the  elements  of  such  a 
complex  idea  as  'this  white  house*. 


384         THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XX  §  z 

that  nothing  else  is  given  to  us  which  can  correspond  to  our 
ideas  and  so  be  their  object. 

Kant's  first  suggestion  is  that  the  object  must  be  thought 
of  as  an  unknown  'something*  to  which  our  ideas  somehow 
correspond.  This  'something*  is  described  as  'something  in 
general'.1  Since  it  has  no  known  characteristics,  the  'something' 
to  which  we  refer  one  complex  idea  cannot  be  distinguished 
from  the  'something'  to  which  we  refer  another  complex  idea ; 
or  at  any  rate  it  can  be  distinguished  only  by  the  fact  that  we 
refer  one  complex  idea  to  it  and  not  another.  If  this  is  so,  the 
concept  of  an  object  must  be  the  concept  of  'something  in 
general  =  #'.2 

This  prima  facie  analysis  Kant  regards  as  inadequate,  and 
he  endeavours  to  carry  it  further.  If  we  take  our  experience 
as  it  stands,  we  find  that  our  thought  of  the  relation  between 
our  ideas  and  the  object  involves  some  kind  of  necessity. 
The  object — which  at  present  we  are  regarding  as  an  unknown 
something  to  which  our  ideas  are  referred — is  thought  of  as 
preventing  our  ideas  from  being  haphazard  or  arbitrary;  or, 
to  put  the  same  point  positively,  it  is  thought  of  as  a  source 
of  necessary  agreement  in  our  ideas.  Ideas  referred  to  an  object 
must  agree  among  themselves,  that  is,  they  must  possess 
unity.  From  this  we  are  expected  to  conclude  that  the  concept 
of  an  object  is  essentially  the  concept  of  the  necessary  synthetic 
unity  of  our  ideas.3 

1  'etwas  iiberhaupt.' 

2  I  need  hardly  say  that  V  here  stands  for  the  unknown,  but  it  may 
perhaps  be  worth  recalling  that  categories  are  concepts  of  an  object 
in  general — concepts  of  what  an  object  must  be  if  it  is  to  be  an  object. 

3  I  have  added  the  qualifications  *  necessary  synthetic*  to  'unity*; 
compare  A  101.  This  unity,  as  a  synthetic  or  qualitative  unity,  is  a 
unity  of  different  elements,  not  the  quantitative  and  homogeneous 
unity  which  is  thought  under  the  category  of  unity;  see  B  131  and 
B  114.  The  concept  of  this  necessary  synthetic  unity  is  identified 
by  Kant  with  the  concept  of  an  object,  because  it  is  the  concept  of 
the  essential  characteristic  or  necessary  form  of  all  objects,  whatever 
may  be  the  differences  in  their  given  matter.  What  distinguishes  a 
real  object  from  an  imaginary  one  is  that  its  elements  are  necessarily 
connected  together  (and  ultimately  that  it  is  a  part  of  the  one  objective 
world  whose  elements  are  necessarily  connected  together). 


XX  §  3]         THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  385 

We  have  indeed  spoken  as  if  the  essential  character  of  the 
object  were  to  be  found  in  its  being  the  source  of  necessary 
synthetic  unity,  and  not  in  this  necessary  synthetic  unity 
itself.  Such  a  view  is  a  transitional  stage  introduced  in  order 
to  lead  us  to  the  true  view  of  the  character  of  the  object  and 
to  clear  our  minds  of  erroneous  theories.  We  have  to  do  only 
with  our  ideas,  not  with  an  unknown  something  which  corre- 
sponds to  our  ideas,  and  which  in  being  different  from  all  our 
ideas  is  for  us  nothing  at  all.1  According  to  Kant,  when  we 
judge  that  the  idea  (or  appearance)  of  this  white  house  is  an 
idea  (or  appearance)  of  a  real  object,  we  are  judging  that  the 
elements  of  which  it  is  composed  are  bound  together  in  a 
necessary  unity.2  To  know  an  object  is  to  recognise  the  presence 
of  this  necessary  synthetic  unity  in  our  ideas.3 

All  this  must  be  taken  as  a  prima  facie  analysis  of  experience 
in  the  light  of  doctrines  already  established.  Its  aim  is  to  lead 
us  up  to  the  doctrine  which  Kant  believes  he  is  able  to  prove. 
It  must  not  be  taken  as  itself  a  proof.4 

§  3.  The  Formal  Unity  of  Consciousness 

On  Kant's  view  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  consti- 
tutes the  essential  character  of  an  object  of  experience  must, 
if  it  is  properly  to  be  regarded  as  necessary,  have  its  origin 
in  the  nature  of  the  mind.  Hence  he  asserts  that  this  unity 
is  simply  the  formal  unity  of  consciousness  in  the  synthesis  of  the 

1  Kant  is  not  here  renouncing  the  thing-in-itself :  he  is  only  denying 
that  we  can  know  it,  and  that  we  can  know  it  to  be  the  source  of 
unity  in  our  ideas.  Compare  Chapters  LV  and  LVI. 

2  Compare  A  109. 

8  How  far  such  knowledge  involves  also  a  reference  to  an  unknown 
'something'  or  thing-in-itself  is  a  difficult  question.  Kant  always 
holds  that  the  object  we  know,  while  it  is  not  the  thing  as  it  is  in  itself, 
is  the  thing  as  it  appears,  and  must  appear,  to  human  minds.  The 
really  important  point,  however,  is  that  the  necessary  synthetic  unity 
of  the  object  comes,  not  from  the  thing-in-itself,  but  from  the 
mind. 

4  Kant  has,  however,  already  shown  the  necessity  for  unity  on  the 
subjective  side;  see  A  103. 

VOL.  I  N 


386        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XX  §  3 

manifold  of  ideas*  This  assertion  is  explained  by  the  further 
statement  that  we  know  the  object  when  we  have  produced 
synthetic  unity  in  the  manifold  of  intuition. 

Here  Kant  seems  to  identify  the  unity  of  the  object  with 
the  formal  unity2  of  consciousness,  and  that  this  is  not  a  mere 
slip  is  shown  by  several  repetitions  of  the  view.3  Perhaps  such 
an  identification  can  be  justified  on  Copernican  principles/ 
but  personally  I  find  it  difficult  to  justify,  or  even  clearly  to 
understand.  It  seems  more  intelligible  to  say  that  the  unity 
of  the  object  originates  in,  and  is  produced  by,  the  unity  of 
consciousness;  and  again  that  unity  of  consciousness  is  mani- 
fested only  in  the  unity  of  the  synthesis  whereby  the  manifold 
is  united  into  an  object.  In  short,  it  seems  easier  to  regard 
the  unity  of  consciousness  and  the  unity  of  the  object  as 
correlated  and  interdependent  than  to  regard  them  as  identical. 
Kant  himself  at  times  speaks  of  unity  of  consciousness  and 
unity  of  the  object  as  if  they  were  correlated  and  inter- 
dependent ;4  and  if  we  find  it  easier  to  follow  his  argument  on 
this  supposition,  I  think  we  are  entitled  to  adopt  it.  We  must, 
however,  leave  open  the  possibility  that  the  language  which  im- 
plies identification  is  the  more  exact  expression  of  his  meaning.5 

1  A  105.  This  formal  unity  of  consciousness  is,  I  think,  the  same 
as  the  unity  of  apperception ;  but  it  is  perhaps  possible  that  the  unity 
of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  could  be  described  in 
similar  terms.  Compare  A  118  and  A  125;  also  Chapter  XXI  §  i 
(at  the  end). 

2  This  unity,  as  formal,  is  independent  of  differences  in  the  matter 
synthetised ;  and  I  take  it  that  (just  as  in  the  case  of  the  forms  of  time 
and  space)  we  should  be  able  to  understand  both  its  internal  necessity 
and  its  necessity  as  a  condition  of  experience.  The  character  of  this 
necessity  is  discussed  in  A  1 06  (the  second  paragraph)  and  the  following 
pages. 

3  Compare,  for  example,  A  109,  where  the  relation  to  an  object 
is  said  to  be  simply  the  necessary  unity  of  consciousness.  Such  a  view 
seems  to  be  implied  also  when  Kant  identifies  the  unity  of  the  object 
with  the  unity  of  the  synthesis  whereby  the  manifold  is  combined; 
and  again  when  he  identifies  the   concept   of  the  object  with  the 
concept  of  the  synthesis  (or  with  the  concept  of  the  unity,  or  rule, 
of  the  synthesis).  4  See,  for  example,  A  250,  B  134,  and  B  143. 

*  I  believe  that  a  doctrine  of  this  type  is  to  be  found  in  Hegel  and 
even  in  T.  H.  Green. 


XX  §  4]        THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  387 

It  should  in  any  case  be  obvious  that  we  have  here  no  pre- 
Critical  doctrine.  The  same  theory  is  expressed  more  briefly 
in  the  second  edition.1  There  an  object  is  defined  as  'that  in 
the  concept  of  which  the  manifold  of  a  given  intuition  is 
united.9  All  unification  of  ideas  is  then  said  to  demand  unity 
of  consciousness  in  the  synthesis  of  these  ideas.  The  inference 
\s  finally  drawn,  precisely  as  in  the  present  passage,  that  it 
is  the  unity  of  consciousness  which  alone  constitutes2  the 
relation  of  ideas  to  an  object. 

§  4.  Synthesis  and  Concepts 

Kant  next  proceeds  to  connect  his  doctrine  of  synthesis 
and  conception3  with  that  formal  unity  of  consciousness  (or 
unity  of  apperception)  which  he  has  identified  with  the  unity 
of  the  object.  Since  the  concepts  most  obviously  at  work  in 
the  synthesis  of  recognition  are  particular  concepts,  he  is  obliged 
to  explain  the  part  played  by  such  concepts  in  experience.  For 
the  purpose  of  illustration  he  uses  the  concept  of  'triangle'  and 
the  concept  of  'body'.  These  are  particular  concepts,  and  not 
universal  concepts  or  categories — the  categories  are  reserved 
for  subsection  4.  The  first  is  presumably  a  pure,  the  second 
an  empirical,  concept. 

Here  again  the  order  of  exposition  is  awkward:  we  might 
have  followed  him  more  easily,  if  he  had  proceeded  to  explain 
at  once  what  he  meant  by  the  formal  unity  of  consciousness. 
Further  difficulties  arise  from  the  fact  that  the  language  which 
he  uses  is  in  many  ways  obscure.  I  believe  that  if  we  are  to 
obtain  even  an  approximate  understanding  of  what  he  means, 
we  must  remember  that  he  is  still  giving  us  a  provisional 
analysis  of  experience,  not  his  'progressive*  and  authoritative 
proof.4 

1B  137.  t'ausmacht.'  Compare  A  109. 

3  This   doctrine   is   adumbrated   in   the   Metaphysical   Deduction 
(A  77-9  =  B  103-4),  and  has  been  further  elaborated  in  the  account 
of  the  threefold  synthesis. 

4  We  must  indeed  remember  that  the  whole  of  Section  2  is  pro- 
visional; see  A  98. 


388        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XX  §  5 

§  5.  Concept  and  Rule 

We  have  been  told1  that  we  know  the  object  when  we  have 
produced  synthetic  unity — that  is,  necessary  synthetic  unity — 
in  the  manifold  of  intuition.  This  task  is  the  work  of  a  synthesis 
of  imagination  which  must  be  brought  to  concepts;  and  in 
bringing  the  synthesis  to  concepts  we  make  explicit,  rto  a. 
greater  or  less  degree,  the  rule  at  work  in  the  synthesis.  Kant 
repeats  this  doctrine  here  by  asserting  (i)  that  synthetic  unity 
is  impossible,  unless  the  total  complex  intuition  can  be  pro- 
duced by  a  function2  of  synthesis  in  accordance  with  a  rule; 
and  (2)  that  such  a  function  of  synthesis  makes  possible  a 
concept  in  which  the  given  manifold  is  united.  The  concept 
is  made  possible  by  the  synthesis  because  it  is  a  concept  of 
the  rule  of  the  synthesis :  if  there  were  no  rule  in  the  synthesis, 
there  could  be  no  concept. 

So  far  we  have  nothing  new,  but  Kant  says  further  that  the 
function  of  synthesis  also  makes  the  reproduction  of  the  manifold 
necessary  a  priori.  A  similar  phrase  recurs  later,3  and  we  may 
postpone  consideration  of  its  meaning. 

Kant  illustrates  his  doctrine  by  the  concept  of  'triangle'.4 
When  we  think  a  triangle  as  an  object,  we  are  conscious6  of 
the  combination  (or  synthesis)  of  three  straight  lines  in  accor- 
dance with  a  rule,6  and  an  intuition  of  triangle  can  always  be 
produced7  by  such  a  synthesis.8 

1 A  105. 

a  It  is  perhaps  safer  to  suppose  that  'function*  is  not  here  used  in  a 
technical  sense,  but  it  may  indicate  that  the  synthesis  must  be  one  act ; 
compare  A  68  =  B  93.  The  word  I  have  translated  as  'produced*  is 
'hervorgebracht*. 

8  In  A  106.  For  the  discussion  of  this,  see  §  7  below. 

4  We  must  remember  that  the  concept  of  'triangle*  is  not  a  singular 
idea,  not  an  idea  of  'this  triangle*.  It  is  the  idea  of  the  universal 
character  'triangularity*  present  in  this  and  other  triangles;  see 
Chapter  IX  §  4. 

*  This,  I  think,  implies  a  concept  of  the  synthesis  (or  rule  of 
synthesis). 

6  Note  that  in  A  141  =  B  180  this  rule  is  identified  with  the  'schema* 
of  triangle.  7 ' dargestellt.' 

8  The  illustration  explains,  in  the  reverse  order,  the  two  general 
assertions  just  made :  it  throws  no  light  on  'necessary  reproduction*. 


XX  §  5]        THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  389 

The  concept  of  *  triangle'  is  presumably  a  pure  mathematical 
concept,  and  the  synthesis  is  a  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold 
of  space ;  but  it  is  doubtful  whether  we  are  to  attach  importance 
to  this,  since  the  assertion  for  which  this  illustration  is  given 
seems  to  be  quite  general.  If  we  pass  over  the  difficulty  about 
necessary  reproduction,  we  have  merely  Kant's  usual  doctrine 
that  in  order  to  know  an  object  the  manifold  must  be  united 
in  accordance  with  a  rule  of  synthesis  which  is  made  explicit 
in  the  concept  of  the  object.1  He  expresses  this  here  by  saying 
that  this  unity  of  rule  determines  all  the  manifold;2  and  he 
adds  that  it  limits  the  manifold  to  conditions  which  make  the 
unity  of  apperception  possible.  This  further  statement  is,  at 
the  present  stage,  obscure ;  but  so  far  as  unity  of  apperception 
is  necessary  for  unity  of  rule,  the  manifold — if  we  are  to  know 
an  object — must  conform  to  the  conditions3  without  which 
there  could  be  no  unity  of  apperception. 

We  are  then  informed  that  the  concept  of  'this  unity*  is  the 
idea  (or  concept)  of  the  object  =  x.  Unfortunately  Kant's 
language  leaves  it  uncertain  whether  by  'this  unity'  he  means 
'the  unity  of  the  rule'  or  'the  unity  of  apperception'.4  His 
general  position  is,  however,  clear  enough.  When  we  think  an 
object  such  as  a  triangle,  we  do  so  not  merely  by  means  of 
the  particular  predicates  contained  in  the  concept  of  'triangle' ; 
we  also  think  of  it  as  an  object,  and  therefore  bring  it  under 


1  Compare  Chapter  XIII  §  5. 

2  We  may  add  'so  far  as  it  constitutes  an  object*. 

3  These  conditions  are  the  forms  of  thought  or  the  categories ; 
compare  A  1 1 1 .  It  would  be  as  true  to  say  that  the  unity  of  apperception 
is  the  condition  of  the  categories  as  to  say  that  the  categories  are 
conditions  of  the  unity  of  apperception. 

4  Whichever  interpretation  we  adopt,  it  will  make  little  difference 
to  Kant's  doctrine.  The  unity  of  the  rule  is  the  unity  manifested 
whenever  we  know  an  object  by  means  of  a  concept ;  and  this  universal 
unity  of  rule  is  dependent  on  the  unity  of  apperception  as  the  unity 
of  apperception  is  dependent  upon  it.  On  the  whole  it  seems  simpler 
to  take  Kant  as  identifying  the  concept  of  the  object  in  general  with 
the  concept  of  the  unity  of  apperception,  provided  we  remember  that 
the  unity  of  apperception  is  necessarily  manifested  in  unity  of  synthesis 
and  unity  of  rule. 


390        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XX  §  6 

the  concept  of  'an  object  in  general'.1  This  concept  (which  is 
a  concept  of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  characteristic  of  all 
objects)  is  identified  by  Kant  with  the  concept  of  the  unity 
of  apperception,  and  in  the  present  passage  perhaps  also  with 
the  concept  of  that  unity  of  rule  in  which  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception is  manifested.2 

§  6.  Empirical  Concepts 

All  knowledge,  whether  empirical  or  pure,  requires  a  concept, 
however  imperfect3  or  obscure4  the  concept  may  be ;  and  the 
concept  must  always  be  universal,  so  far  as  its  form  is  concerned.5 

This  is  true  whether  we  are  dealing  with  pure  concepts  like 
'triangle1  or  empirical  concepts  like  'body*.  The  account  which 
Kant  has  given  is  intended  to  be  general,  and  since  pure 
mathematical  concepts  differ  in  many  ways  from  empirical 
concepts,  it  is  necessary  to  see  how  the  account  can  apply  to 
empirical  concepts. 

An  empirical  concept  also  is,  or  contains,  a  rule.6  The 

1  We  need  not  make  this  concept  *  clear'  to  ourselves ;  still  less  need 
we  make  it  'distinct'  by  discovering  on  analysis  that  it  is  identical 
with  the  concept  of  the  unity  of  apperception. 

2  If  the  concept  of  'triangle'  is  a  pure  concept  of  mathematics, 
Kant's  illustration  is  not  altogether  satisfactory;  for  a  mathematical 
triangle  is,  strictly  speaking,  not  an  object,  but  only  the  form  of  an 
object  (see  B  147),  and  it  is  not  the  appearance  of  a  thing-in-itself. 
The  concrete  physical  triangle  alone  is  an  object  proper;  and  it  is 
a  thing,  not  as  it  is  in  itself,  but  as  it  must  appear  to  human  minds. 
Kant  has  presumably  chosen  his  example  because  the  connexion 
between  the  concept  and  the  rule  of  synthesis  is  obvious.  If  his  state- 
ment is  intended  to  cover  the  concrete  physical  triangle,  the  problems 
raised  are  similar  to  those  connected  with  'body'  in  A  106. 

8  To  possess  logical  'perfection'  a  cognition  should  be  (i)  universal, 
(2)  distinct,  (3)  true,  and  (4)  certain;  see  Log.  EinL  V  (IX  38).  By 
'imperfect'  here  I  think  Kant  means  primarily  'imperfect  in  quality', 
that  is,  'indistinct'. 

4  'Obscure*  is  the  opposite  of  'clear'.  We  need  not  be  immediately 
conscious  of  the  concept,  still  less  need  we  have  analysed  it  and  so 
made  it  'distinct'. 

6  Compare  Log.  §  2  (IX  91):  'The  form  of  concepts  is  their  uni- 
versality, their  matter  is  their  object'. 

6  Or  'schema',  compare  A  141  =  B  180. 


XX  §  6]         THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  391 

concept  of  'body',  for  example,  serves  as  a  rule  for  our  knowledge 
of  appearances  in  space.  It  is  concerned,  as  we  should  expect, 
with  the  unity  of  that  manifold  which  is  thought  or  conceived 
through  it.1 

The  concept  of  'body'  can  serve  as  a  rule  for  synthetising 
intukions,  only  if  'it  represents,  in  given  appearances,  the 
necessary  reproduction  of  their  manifold,  and  therefore  the 
synthetic  unity  in  our  consciousness  of  them'. 

The  concept  of  'body'  is  a  concept  of  body  as  an  object, 
and  therefore  it  naturally  represents  that  necessary  synthetic 
unity2  which  is,  and  must  be,  present  in  appearances,  if  they 
are  to  constitute  an  object.  According  to  Kant  this  implies 
that  the  concept  of  'body'  must  also  represent  the  necessary 
synthetic  unity  of  our  consciousness  of  such  appearances. 

It  is  more  difficult  to  understand  what  Kant  means  when 
he  says  that  the  concept  of  'body'  must  represent  the  necessary 
reproduction  of  the  manifold  of  given  appearances. 

This  phrase  was  used  also  in  regard  to  the  concept  of 
'triangle',  but  the  two  cases  are  very  different.  We  are  not 
thinking  about  a  mathematical  body  which  can  be  constructed 
a  priori  in  pure  intuition.  We  are  thinking  about  a  concrete 
physical  body,  as  Kant  himself  makes  perfectly  clear.  The 
concept  of  body,  when  we  perceive*  anything  in  space,  makes 
the  idea  of  extension  (and  therefore  of  impenetrability,  shape, 
and  so  on)4  necessary. 

1  A  1 06,  'nach  der  Einheit  des  Mannigfaltigen*.  Substitute  'in  regard 
to  the  unity*  for  'as  the  unity*  in  Kemp  Smith's  translation.  Compare 
also  A  140  =  B  179. 

2  Such  unity  is  the  condition  of  the  necessary  reproducibility  of 
appearances;  compare  A  101.  3  Not  'imagine*. 

4  'Extension,  impenetrability,  shape,  and  so  on*  are  all  thought  in 
the  concept  of  body,  and  the  judgements  which  attribute  these  to 
bodies  are  analytic  judgements;  see  B  12.  In  the  Prolegomena  (IV  289) 
Kant  asserts  that  these  are  the  primary  qualities  of  a  body,  and  are 
dependent  upon  space.  InA2i  =  B  35  he  suggests  that  impenetra- 
bility (like  hardness  and  colour)  belongs  to  sensation,  and  only  extension 
and  shape  belong  to  the  pure  intuition  of  space.  In  A  284  —  B  340 
substance  itself  is  identified  with  'impenetrable  extension',  which  in 
turn  is  identified  with  matter  in  A  398. 


392        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XX  §  6 

In  spite  of  the  difficulties  raised  by  some  commentators 
I  can  see  nothing  pre-Critical  in  such  a  statement.  It  is  little 
more  than  an  elaboration  of  what  Kant  has  already  said  in 
his  analysis  of  the  object.  When  we  perceive  any  object,  we 
think  that  all  our  ideas  of  it  must  be  consistent  with  one  another. 
When  we  perceive  a  body,  we  think  that  it  must  have  extension, 
impenetrability,  shape,  and  so  on.  This  is  a  necessity  which  we 
all  recognise  in  our  experience.1 

Kant  is  still  giving  us  his  prima  facie  analysis  of  experience. 
He  is  not  using  this  necessity  as  a  premise  for  his  argument, 
but  is  directing  our  attention  to  something  in  experience 
which  requires  explanation  and  justification.  By  this  means 
he  leads  us  up  to  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories ; 
but  the  doctrine  of  the  unity  of  apperception  is  established 
independently,  and  only  so  can  it  justify  and  explain  the 
apparent  necessity  which  we  find  in  experience. 

The  necessity,  as  Kant  immediately  goes  on  to  explain,  is 
not  due  to  the  concept  of  body  taken  by  itself.  It  is  due  to  the 
fact  that  when  we  think  the  manifold  under  any  concept,  we 
bring  it  under  the  unity  of  apperception.  Why  it  should  be 
assumed  that  Kant  knew  nothing  of  the  categories  when  this 
was  written  passes  my  comprehension.  He  has  a  right,  and 
even  a  duty,  to  explain  the  unity  of  apperception  and  its 
relation  to  concepts,  and  especially  to  the  concept  of  an  object 
in  general,  before  he  goes  on  to  show  that  the  categories  are 
involved  in  the  unity  of  apperception.2  The  four  short  pages 
in  which  he  does  so  seem  to  me  none  too  long. 

1  We  must  also  remember  that  when  we  judge  this  to  be  a  body, 
we  also  judge  it  implicitly  to  be  an  object  and  so  to  have  necessary 
synthetic  unity. 

2  We  already  know  that  the  concept  of  an  object  in  general 
differentiates  itself  into  the  categories  (A  93  =  B  126) ;  and  we  know 
from  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  that  when  we  unify  the  manifold 
by  means  of  any  concept  we  are  judging,  and  that  such  judgement 
by  means  of  its  form  imposes  the  categories  upon  objects ;  see  especially 
A  79  =  B  104-5. 


XX  §  7]        THE  OBJECT  AND  THE  CONCEPT  393 

§  7.  Necessary  Reproduction 

The  chief  difficulty  which  I  see  in  the  passage  is  the  phrase 
'necessary  reproduction*.  We  have  two  statements  to  consider. 
There  is  first  of  all  the  general  assertion— illustrated  by  the 
exarnple  of  'triangle' — that  'the  function  of  synthesis  in 
accordance  with  a  rule'  makes  the  reproduction  of  the  manifold 
necessary  a  priori*  And  secondly  there  is  the  assertion  that 
the  concept  of  'body'  can  serve  as  a  rule  for  intuitions  only 
if  it  'represents  the  necessary  reproduction  of  the  manifold  of 
given  appearances'.2  In  spite  of  the  differences  in  terminology, 
and  in  spite  of  the  differences  between  a  pure  and  an  empirical 
concept,  it  seems  to  me  probable  that  Kant's  doctrine  in  these 
two  statements  is  intended  to  be  the  same.3 

It  may  be  thought  that  Kant  means  something  comparatively 
simple,  namely,  that  the  concept  of  the  object  controls  the 
synthesis  of  reproduction,  whether  that  synthesis  be  empirical 
or  pure.  For  example,  in  knowing  a  triangle  the  concept  of 
'triangle'  will  compel  me  to  reproduce  the  side  AB  when  appre- 
hension has  gone  on  to  side  BC;  and  again  in  knowing  a  body, 
the  concept  of  'body'  will  compel  me  to  reproduce  extension 
when  apprehension  has  gone  on  to  impenetrability.4 

I  cannot  bring  myself  to  accept  this  simple  explanation,5 

1 A  105.  2  A  106. 

3  The  concept  'represents*  necessary  reproduction,  because  it  is  a 
concept  of  the  rule  of  such  a  synthesis  as  makes  reproduction  necessary 
a  priori. 

These  two  passages  should  be  compared  with  several  others :  with 
the  statement  in  A  108  that  'the  rules  of  synthesis  make  appearances 
necessarily  reproducible',  and  so  determine  an  object;  with  the  two 
statements  in  A  101  about  making  'reproduction  of  appearances' 
possible,  and  about  making  'a  thorough-going  synthesis  of  reproduc- 
tion* possible;  and  with  the  doctrine  of  affinity  in  A  121  ff. 

4  These  would  be  examples  of  association  by  affinity ;  compare 
Chapter  XIX  §  4  and  A  122. 

6  This  explanation  is  concerned  only  with  the  law  of  subjective 
reproduction  which  is  empirical  and  not  a  priori ;  see  A  100,  A  121, 
and  B  152.  I  doubt  if  it  can  be  justified  even  on  the  ground  that 
Kant  in  A  102  regards  the  pure  transcendental  synthesis  as  repro- 
ductive.

394        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XX  §  7 

and  I  believe  Kant  is  trying  to  state  something  more  difficult 
and  more  obscure.  I  think  he  is  concerned  with  that  necessary 
synthetic  unity  of  the  object  upon  which  rests  the  possibility, 
and  indeed  the  necessity,  that  all  appearances  should  be  in 
themselves  'associable'.1  He  appears  to  me  to  be  suggesting 
that  the  synthesis  in  accordance  with  a  rule  (or  a  concept) 
imposes  necessary  synthetic  unity  on  the  manifold.2  To  do  this 
is  to  make  possible  a  thorough-going  synthesis  of  reproduction,3 
or  to  make  appearances  necessarily  reproducible.4  This  doctrine 
offers  no  difficulty  in  the  case  of  pure  concepts  like  'triangle'.5 
In  the  case  of  empirical  concepts  the  statement  can  be  accepted 
only  as  a  provisional  analysis  of  our  experience,  the  proper 
significance  of  which  is  explained  in  the  following  paragraph6 
by  reference  to  the  unity  of  apperception.7 

Kant's  statement  is  certainly  not  clear  in  itself,8  and  it  is 
possible  that  his  thinking  is  confused.9  Nevertheless  he  has 
warned  us  to  expect  obscurities  which  will  be  clarified  only 
by  what  comes  later.10  This  makes  it  more  than  usually  ille- 
gitimate to  interpret  the  passage  as  if  it  stood  entirely  alone ; 

1  Compare  A  122. 

2  Strictly  speaking,  it  does  so  only  because  it  involves,  and  is 
conditioned  by,  a  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

8  Compare  A  101  and  Chapter  XIX  §  6. 

4  Compare  A  108  and  A  122. 

5  Compare  A  78-9  =  B  104  and  Chapter  XIII  §  6. 

6  The  second  paragraph  of  A  106. 

7  The  synthesis  in  accordance  with  the  empirical  concept  of  'body' 
imposes  necessary  synthetic  unity  on  the  given  manifold  only  because 
it  is  also  a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  based  on  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception (compare  A  101,  A  108,  and  A  122-3)  and  therefore  on  the 
categories. 

8  I  should  have  felt  little  difficulty,  if  he  had  spoken  of  'necessary 
reproducibility'  instead  of  'necessary  reproduction*. 

9  Confusion  may  result  from  the  fact  that  he  has  spoken  as  if  the 
pure  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  were  itself  reproductive. 
The  'necessary  reproduction*  of  which  he  speaks  may  in  that  case 
be  the  transcendental  synthesis  which  combines  the  given  manifold 
in  accordance  with  the  categories.  This  should  not  be  described  as 
'reproduction*  at  all.  The  empirical  concept  'represents'  this  synthesis 
only  because  it  presupposes  the  categories.

and  while  I  do  not  speak  with  confidence,  I  think  we 
are  justified  in  finding  here  the  doctrine  of  the  transcen- 
dental affinity  which  is  more  clearly  expressed  in  his  later 
exposition.1

CHAPTER    XXI 
APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  UNITY  OF  NATURE 

§  i.  Necessary  Synthetic  Unity  and  Apperception 

The  essential  characteristic  of  an  object,  according  to  Kant's 
provisional  analysis,  is  necessary  synthetic  unity,  and  this 
unity  has  been  identified  with  the  formal  unity  of  consciousness 
in  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  ideas.1  But  all  necessity 
must  have  a  transcendental  ground  or  condition — it  could 
never  be  derived  from  empirical  concepts.2  To  have  a  trans- 
cendental ground  is  to  be  derived  from  the  nature  of  the 
knowing  mind.  Hence  if  we  are  to  justify  our  belief  in  the 
necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  object — and  in  the  unity  of 
consciousness  necessarily  present  in  the  synthesis  of  the 
manifold  of  all3  our  intuitions — we  must  discover  its  trans- 
cendental ground ;  and  this  will  at  the  same  time  be  the  trans- 
cendental ground  of  our  concepts  of  objects  in  general,4  and 
consequently  of  all  objects  of  experience5 — for  without  these 
concepts  (or  categories)  we  could  not  think  any  object  for  our 
intuitions. 

This  transcendental  ground  or  condition  is  transcendental 

1  See  A  105  and  also  A  106.  2  A  106;  compare  Am. 

3  Here    Kant  may  be   passing  from   the   unity  of  consciousness 
present  in  the  synthesis  of  each  separate  object  to  the  unity  of  con- 
sciousness present  in  the  synthesis  of  all  objects,  which  taken  together 
constitute  the  world  of  experience ;  compare  §  7  below. 

4  It  is  perhaps  conceivable  that  this  may  refer  here  to  concepts 
like  'triangle*  and  'body':  but  I  believe  it  refers  to  the  categories, 
which  alone  are  strictly  concepts  of  objects  in  general.   Since  the 
categories  are  concepts  of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  is  the 
essential  characteristic  of  all  objects,  the  transcendental  ground  of 
necessary  synthetic  unity  is  also  the  transcendental  ground  of  the 
categories;  and  indeed  necessary  synthetic  unity  is  imposed  on  the 
manifold  only  by  means  of  the  categories. 

0  An  'object*  is  defined  by  Kant  in  this  passage  as  'something  the 
concept  of  which  expresses  necessity  of  synthesis*.  Here  again  the 
concept  of  the  object  includes — and  is  perhaps  identical  with — the 
concept  of  necessary  synthesis. 


XXI  §  i]  APPERCEPTION  397 

apperception,  and    it    is    not    derivative,    but  ultimate  or 
'original'. 

This  is  the  point  at  which  we  really  come  to  grips  with  the 
most  central,  the  most  important,1  and  yet  in  some  ways  the 
most  elusive,  of  all  Kant's  doctrines.  His  thought  is  no  doubt 
difficult  enough  in  itself,  but  the  difficulty  is  greatly  increased 
by  his  carelessness  in  the  use  of  language.  How  far  this  care- 
lessness of  language  represents  a  real  confusion  of  thought  is 
to  me  a  matter  of  uncertainty ;  but  it  is  no  easy  task  to  clarify, 
and  if  possible  to  reconcile,  statements  which  too  often  are, 
at  least  verbally,  incompatible. 

,  Thus  apperception  is  spoken  of  as  a  power  or  faculty,2 
which  I  have  taken  to  be  identical  with  understanding.  But  it 
is  also  spoken  of  as  an  act3 — an  act  of  spontaneity  which  is 
identified  with  the  idea4  'I  think'  accompanying  all  my  ideas. 
No  doubt  the  power  of  apperception  is  manifested  in  the  act 
of  apperception,  but  we  must  keep  in  mind  these  two  different 
meanings  when  we  consider  Kant's  other  assertions;  for 
example,  his  identification  of  apperception  with  the  simple 
idea  T,5  or  again  with  'thorough-going  self-identity'.6 

The  difficulties  seem  to  me  to  concern  chiefly  the  act, 
rather  than  the  power,  of  apperception.  In  particular  there 
is  the  difficulty  how  far  this  act  can  be  separated,  even  in 
thought,  from  the  synthesis  of  imagination,  and  especially 
from  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.7 

1  To  regard  the  stress  laid  upon  it  as  due  merely  to  Kant's  private 
convictions  seems  to  me  erroneous.  Compare  Kemp  Smith,  Commen- 
tary, pp.  212  and  261. 

2  Compare  A  94,  A  114,  and  A  117  n.  This  power  is  explicitly 
identified  with  understanding  in   B   134  n.   Curiously  enough  the 
unity  of  apperception  (in  relation  to  the  synthesis  of  imagination) 
is  identified  with  understanding  in  A  119.  Compare  also  M.A.d.N. 

(IV  554)- 

8  B  132.  This  act  might  be  described  as  a  formal  act,  and  it  seems 
at  times  to  be  equivalent  to  the  form  (or  unity)  of  acts  of  judgement. 

4  This  idea  is  a  concept,  or  better  a  judgement ;  see  A  398.  Compare 
also  A  342  =  B  400  and  A  348  =  B  406.

398        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXI  §  2 

§  2.  Empirical  and  Transcendental  Apperception 

Kant  seems  to  take  it  for  granted  that  apperception  is  to 
be  identified  with  self-consciousness1 — a  word  which  also  may 
be  used  ambiguously  either  for  a  power  or  for  an  act  (or  state) 
— and  he  proceeds  to  distinguish  empirical  from  transcendental 
apperception.2 

It  should  be  noted  that  Kant  sometimes  speaks  as  if  pure  or 
transcendental  apperception  were  equivalent  to  self-identity,3 
and  this  has  led  some  commentators  to  stress  self-identity  at 
the  expense  of  self-consciousness.4  Such  a  view  is  legitimate  to 
this  extent — that  Kant  does  not  maintain  consciousness  of  self 
to  be  necessarily  a  'clear'  idea.5  Nevertheless  although  it  may 
be  convenient  at  times  to  take  apperception — or,  better,  the 
unity  of  apperception — as  equivalent  to  the  unity  or  identity 
of  the  thinking  self,  it  seems  to  me  quite  certain  that  Kant 
regarded  self-consciousness  (not  merely  self-identity)  as 
necessary  for  all  knowledge  of  objects,6  and  considered 

of  the  manifold  of  ideas'  (identified  with  the  unity  which  constitutes 
the  concepts  of  the  object  and  makes  the  object  necessary)  seems  to 
be  the  unity  of  apperception.  If  so,  then  in  A  106  'the  synthetic  unity 
in  the  consciousness  of  the  manifold'  (which  is  represented  by  the 
rule)  ought  presumably  to  be  the  unity  of  apperception.  Immediately 
thereafter  we  are  told  that  we  must  find  a  transcendental  ground  'for 
the  unity  of  consciousness  in  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  all  our 
intuitions',  and  this  transcendental  ground  is  transcendental  apper- 
ception. Kant  may  mean  that  transcendental  apperception  is  the 
ground  of  the  unity  of  apperception,  although  if  so,  we  should  like 
to  know  whether  'transcendental  apperception'  is  used  here  for  the 
act  or  for  the  power.  But  perhaps  he  may  mean  that  transcendental 
apperception  is  the  ground  of  a  unity  manifested  in  the  synthesis 
of  imagination. 

Note  that  in  A  117  pure  apperception  is  said  to  give  a  principle 
of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  all  possible  intuition,  and 
in  A  118  this  synthetic  unity  is  said  to  presuppose,  or  include,  a  pure 
synthesis,  namely  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

1  This,  I  think,  is  the  ordinary  usage  of  Leibniz.  The  corresponding 
word  in  Descartes  is  'ccmscientuz'.  a  A  107.  8  See  A  116.

the  object  on  the  one  hand  and  the  self  and  its  states  on  the  other. 


XXI  §2]  APPERCEPTION  399 

apperception  to  be  equivalent  to  self-consciousness.  To  ignore 
or  minimise  this  doctrine  is  to  reject  Kant's  repeated  assertions 
and  to  omit  an  essential  part  of  his  theory. 

The  clearest  account  of  the  difference  between  empirical  and 
transcendental  or  pure  apperception  is  to  be  found  in  the 
Antjiropologie,  and  I  think  that  the  same  doctrine  lies  behind 
Kant's  briefer  statements  in  the  Kritik.  The  knowing  mind  is 
both  active  and  passive,  and  to  be  conscious  of  self  we  must 
be  conscious  both  of  what  the  mind  does  (its  thinking)  and 
of  what  it  suffers  (its  states).1  The  first  kind  of  self-consciousness 
belongs  to  the  understanding  and  is  pure  apperception;  the 
second  is  empirical  apperception  or  inner  sense.2  The  form 
of  inner  sense  is  time,  and  inner  sense  perceives  the  relations 
of  mental  states  only  in  time,  and  consequently  in  a  continual 
flux.3 

This  doctrine  is  borne  out  as  regards  empirical  apperception 
by  the  passage  we  are  considering.4  Empirical  apperception  is 
consciousness  of  the  self  with  regard  to  the  determinations  of 
our  state >  and  is  commonly  called  inner  sense.  It  is  always 
changing,6  and  there  can  be  no  permanent  or  abiding  self  in 
the  flux  of  inner  appearances.

Paralogisms;  also  Nachlass  4723  (XVII  688). 

1  Anthr.  §  4  at  the  end  (VII 134  n.).  It  may  be  noted  that  in  psycho- 
logy we  study  ourselves  in  accordance  with  the  ideas  of  inner  sense, 
while  in  logic  we  study  ourselves  in  accordance  with  what  is  given 
by  intellectual  consciousness,  the  self-consciousness  of  the  under- 
standing ;  compare  B  1 34  n.  Logic  studies  the '  I*  as  a  subject  of  thought ; 
psychology  studies  it  as  an  object  of  perception.  I  can,  however,  be 
conscious,  through  inner  sense,  of  the  changes  in  my  inner  states, 
only  because  I  represent  myself,  through  pure  apperception,  as  one 
and  the  same  subject  in  these  different  states. 

8  Anthr.  §  4  (VII  134).  Compare  B  275  and  B  133.  The  permanent, 
according  to  Kant,  is  to  be  found  only  in  space.

1  Presumably  it  is  the  acts  (and  not  the  power)  of  empirical  apper- 
ception which  are  always  changing.  Yet  these  change  only  as  regards 
their  matter:  their  ultimate  form,  the  'I  think*  which  accompanies 
all  our  ideas,  remains  the  same. 


4oo         THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXI  §  3 

§3.  Inner  Sense  and  Empirical  Apperception 

It  is  difficult  to  be  sure  how  far  Kant  accepts  the  identification 
of  inner  sense  and  empirical  apperception.  Empirical  apper- 
ception is  identified  here  with  what  is  commonly  called  inner 
sense,  but  a  distinction  between  them  is  implied  later.1  In  the 
second  edition2  Kant  says  that  he  carefully  distinguishes' 
between  inner  sense  and  apperception,  but  by  'apperception* 
there  he  seems  to  mean  'pure  or  transcendental  apperception'. 
In  the  Anthropologie,  which  is  one  of  his  latest  works,3  inner 
sense  and  empirical  apperception  are,  as  we  have  seen,  once 
more  identified. 

The  whole  doctrine  of  inner  sense  is  full  of  difficulties  and 
is  reserved  for  discussion  later.4  Nevertheless  it  may  be  observed 
that  if  inner  sense  is  properly  called  'sense',  it  must  be  distinct 
from  understanding,  even  though  it  can  belong  only  to  beings 
possessed  of  reason5  and  is  impossible  apart  from  the  activity 
of  understanding.6  Empirical  apperception,  on  the  other  hand, 
ought  to  be  the  power  of  understanding  as  manifested  empiri- 
cally in  the  recognition  of  our  states  of  mind.  Such  recognition 
no  doubt  involves  inner  sense,  but  empirical  apperception  and 
inner  sense  ought  to  be  different  powers.7 

This  interpretation  is  necessary  if  the  doctrine  of  the  threefold 


2Bi53. 
8  It  is,  however,  of  a  semi-popular  character. 

4  See  Chapters  LII  and  LI  1  1.  A  provisional  statement  has  been 
given  in  Chapter  IV  §  4. 

5  Die  falsche  Spitzfindigkeit  (II  60).  In  this  passage  reason  is  not, 
I  think,  opposed  to  understanding. 

6  See  B  153-4  and  B  68.  Why  this  is  so  must  be  left  over  for  the 
present,  but  it  may  be  suggested  that  if  inner  sense  is  dependent 
upon  time,  there  can  be  no  awareness  of  time  apart  from  memory 
and  judgement.  Such  a  view  may  indeed  be  denied  in  the  light  of 
modern  theories  about  the  specious  present,  but  I  am  not  sure  that 
this  denial  would  be  justified. 

7  By  inner  sense  we  should  be  aware  of  what  is  directly  before  the 
mind.  By  empirical  apperception  we  should  be  aware  of  the  nature 
of  our  thinking  so  far  as  it  is  empirical  (or  particular):  this  clearly 
requires  inner  sense.  By  transcendental  apperception  we  should  be 
aware  of  the  nature  of  our  thinking  so  far  as  it  is  formal. 


XXI  §  3]  APPERCEPTION  401 

synthesis  is  to  be  intelligible,  and  it  finds  definite  support  in 
Kant  himself.1  There  are  three  subjective  sources  of  knowledge 
on  which  all  knowledge  depends.  These  are  sense,  imagination, 
and  apperception,  each  of  which  can  be  considered  empirically, 
that  is,  in  their  application  to  given  appearances.  Appearances 
are  'Represented'2  empirically  by  sense  in  sense-perception  (which 
'of  course  involves  apprehension),  and  all  sense-perceptions  as 
ideas  are  subject  to  time  as  the  form  of  inner  intuition.  Appear- 
ances are  'represented'  empirically  by  apperception  in  recognition, 
which  is  described  as  'consciousness  of  the  identity  of  the 
reproduced3  ideas  with  the  appearances  through  which  they 
were  given'.4  Such  recognition  clearly  involves  concepts  and 
must  be  the  work  of  understanding,  not  of  inner  sense. 

Kant's  view  seems  to  be  this:  that  in  all  knowledge  of 
objects  we  must  be  able,  not  only  to  reproduce,  but  also  to 
remember,  a  series  of  given  appearances.  Such  memory  is 
a  memory  of  the  order  in  which  the  appearances  were  given 
or  perceived,  that  is,  of  the  order  in  which  they  became  modi- 
fications or  states  of  our  mind.  Apart  from  such  a  memory  we 
could  not  know  any  object;  and  Kant  seems  to  hold  that  in 
regarding  appearances  as  appearances  of  an  object,  we  must 
at  the  same  time  remember  them  as  appearances  given  to,  and 
so  as  modifications  of,  the  knowing  subject.5  This  is  the  work 
of  empirical  apperception. 

Empirical  apperception  on  this  view  is  not  passive  sensibility, 
but  the  active  power  of  memory  and  judgement,  through 

1  See  A  115-16  and  compare  Chapter  XIX  §  9. 

2  We  might  translate  this  as  Cognised*,  if  we  remember  that  such 
'cognition'  is  only  an  element  in  our  knowledge  of  objects. 

8  Reproduction  is  the  work  of  imagination,  but  that  we  need  not 
consider  here. 

4  *  Consciousness  that  what  we  now  think  is  the  same  as  what  we 
thought  a  moment  ago* — see  A  103 — must  be  recognition  by  means  of 
empirical  apperception.  Without  it  all  reproduction  is  useless. 

6  The  temporal  order  of  appearances  as  modifications  of  the  mind 
may  of  course  be  different  from  the  temporal  order  of  these  appearances 
in  the  object.  The  appearances  of  a  house  are  given  to  me  successively, 
but  are  coexistent  in  the  object.  Compare  A  190-1  =  B  235-6  and 
the  Analogies  generally. 


4oa        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXI  §  3 

which  the  distinction  of  subject  and  object  is  made.1  Kant 
stresses  the  fact  that  the  acts  of  judgement  in  which  empirical 
apperception  is  manifested  are  a  recognition  or  memory  of 
past  ideas,  or  past  states  of  mind,  and  are  necessary  for  know- 
ledge of  the  object.2  They  appear,  however,  to  include  knowledge 
of  the  object  as  well  as  knowledge  of  our  states  of  ijiind. 
Recognition  is  recognition  'in  the  concept';  and  the  concept 
is  a  concept  both  of  the  object  and  of  the  particular  synthesis 
through  which  ideas  successively  given  are  combined  in  the 
object. 

This,  however,  raises  a  further  difficulty.  Empirical  apper- 
ception is  said  to  be  concerned  with  states  of  mind,  but  it 
must  at  the  same  time  be  concerned,  not  only  with  the  order 
in  which  these  arise  in  our  mental  history,  but  also  with  the 
particular  way  in  which  (as  appearances)  they  are  combined 
in  the  object.  This  means  that  it  must  be  concerned  with  the 
act  of  synthesis,  so  far  as  that  act  is  empirical  (or,  perhaps 
better,  'particular').3  This  seems  to  be  the  view  of  Kant  himself, 
for  he  implies  that  empirical  apperception  (or  empirical 
consciousness  that  what  we  now  think  is  the  same  as  what  we 
thought  before)  involves  knowledge,  obscure  or  clear,  of  the 
act  whereby  successively  given  appearances  are  combined  in 
one  idea.4 

1  It  is  not  to  be  supposed  that  we  first  recognise  appearances  as 
states  of  mind,  and  then  refer  them  to  objects.  We  can  recognise 
states  of  mind  only  in  distinction  from  objects,  and  we  can  recognise 
objects  only  in  distinction  from  states  of  mind — though  such  a  dis- 
tinction may  have  different  degrees  of  clarity.  This  distinction  has 
no  existence  for  sense  and  imagination  by  themselves :  it  presupposes 
the  principles  set  forth  in  the  Analogies.  2  See  A  103-4. 

8  It  must  be  concerned  with  the  act  of  synthesis  so  far  as  that 
act  is  bound  up  with  particular  kinds  of  manifold  and  particular 
kinds  of  objects  such  as  triangles  or  bodies — it  is  a  matter  of 
indifference  whether  the  manifold  in  question  is  pure  or  empirical. 
So  far  as  the  act  is  universal,  that  is,  involved  in  knowledge  of  any 
and  every  object  as  such,  it  is  the  concern  of  transcendental  apper- 
ception. 

4  See  A  103.  This  act  is,  for  example,  the  particular  act  of  addition 
present  in  counting  so  many  units;  the  universal  act  of  synthesis 
which  is  an  element,  not  only  in  counting,  but  in  all  knowledge  what- 
soever must  be  known  through  transcendental  apperception. 


XXI  §  4]  APPERCEPTION  403 

The  acts  of  recognition  in  which  empirical  apperception  is 
manifested  are  acts  of  thought,  and  as  such  are  conditioned 
by  the  forms  of  thought  and  by  the  unity  of  thought  (or 
apperception). 

§  4.  Transcendental  Apperception 

Our  main  concern  is  with  transcendental  apperception. 
Unfortunately  the  meaning  of  this  term  is  here  indicated  only 
incidentally,  and  by  no  means  clearly. 

As  a  power,  transcendental  apperception  must  be  identified 
with  pure  understanding,  but  the  word  'apperception'  indicates 
that  this  power  involves  some  kind  of  self-consciousness. 
It  is  pure  or  transcendental  as  the  source  of  a  priori  cog- 
nitions. These  cognitions  are  in  the  first  place  the  act  of 
pure  apperception  itself,  and  in  the  second  place  the  cate- 
gories. The  act  of  pure  apperception  and  the  categories  are 
alike  elements  in,  and  conditions  of,  our  ordinary  empirical 
judgements.1 

The  main  difficulty  concerns  the  act  of  pure  apperception 
in  which  transcendental  apperception  is  manifested ;  and  when 
Kant  speaks  here2  of  transcendental  apperception  as  'this 
pure,  original,  and  unchangeable  consciousness',  and  again3 
as  'the  original  and  necessary  consciousness  of  the  identity  of 
the  self',  he  must  be  treating  it,  not  as  a  power,  but  as  an  act. 
This  act  appears  to  be  at  once  an  act  of  thinking  and  a  con- 
sciousness of  thinking4 — all  thinking  being  in  some  degree 
self-conscious,  even  if  we  do  not  separate  out  this  element 

1  Note  that  in  A  115  sense,  imagination,  and  apperception — here 
presumably  capacities  or  powers — are  all  described  as c a  priori  elements 
or  foundations'  (conditions),  which  make  the  empirical  use  of  these 
powers  possible.  There  is  no  opposition  between  being  an  element  in, 
and  a  condition  of,  empirical  judgements.  The  condition  does  not 
precede  the  judgement,  but  is  a  necessary  element  within  it,  without 
which  it  could  not  be.  a  A  107.  3  A  108. 

4  Hence  it  is  described  as  the  judgement  'I  think';  see  A  399.  It 
is  purely  intellectual  (B  423  n.),  and  it  gives  us  no  knowledge  of  an 
object  (B  406,  B  429) — except  in  so  far  as  the  activity  of  thinking 
determines  a  manifold  given  to  sense. 


4o4        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXI  §4 

in  it  or  bring  it  explicitly  before  out  mind.1  Furthermore  this 
act  is  a  consciousness  of  the  unity  or  identity  of  thinking,2 
not  of  those  differences  within  it  which  are  determined  by 
the  differences  in  its  matter.3  We  might  perhaps  describe  it 
as  consciousness  of  the  ultimate  and  necessary  form  of  thought,4 
or  perhaps  better  of  the  ultimate  and  necessary  form  of  know- 
ledge.5 As  such  it  is  an  a  priori  element  in  all  knowledge,  and 
it  exists  concretely  only  as  such  an  element. 

This  doctrine  finds  parallels  in  other  parts  of  Kant's 
philosophy.  Sensibility  gives  us  pure  intuitions  (time  and 
space)  whose  content  is  the  forms  of  intuition.  Understanding 
gives  us  pure  concepts  (the  categories)  whose  content  is  the 
forms  of  thought  (so  far  as  given  intuitions  are  determined 
in  relation  to  these  forms);  and  these  pure  concepts  are 
described  as  acts  of  pure  thought.6  We  have  now  come  to 
the  ultimate  (or  fundamental)  act7  of  pure  thought  whose 
content  is  the  ultimate  form  or  unity  of  thought  itself. 

It  seems  not  unreasonable  to  say  that  in  knowing  any 
object  there  must  be  present  a  judgement,  which  we  may 
indicate  by  the  form  *S  is  P*.  But  such  a  judgement  is  not 
only  an  awareness  that  S  is  P :  it  involves  also,  dimly  or  clearly, 

1  The  act  of  pure  apperception  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  introspection, 
nor  is  it  the  judgement  *I  think  that  I  think'. 

2  This  unity  is  supposed  to  articulate  itself  necessarily  in  the  forms 
of  judgement,  and  so  in  the  categories. 

8  These  differences,  being  empirical,  must  be  known  through 
empirical  apperception. 

4  Compare  'the  formal  unity  of  consciousness*  in  A  105.  Kant 
habitually  identifies  the  form  and  unity  of  thinking ;  for  example,  in 
his  definition  of  'f unction'  in  A  68  =  B  93. 

8  In  A  129  the  form  of  all  knowledge  of  objects  is  said  to  consist 
in  the  unity  of  possible  consciousness.  Compare  'the  intellectual 
form  of  all  knowledge  of  the  object'  in  the  same  passage.  The  references 
to  'the  pure  form  of  all  possible  knowledge*  in  A  118  and  'the  form 
of  an  experience  in  general'  in  A  125 — compare  also  A  no — may 
also  be  relevant,  though  certain  complications  are  involved  which 
need  not  be  considered  here.  In  B  169  the  original  synthetic  unity  of 
apperception  is  described  as  'the  form  of  understanding  in  relation 
to  space  and  time  as  original  forms  of  sensibility*. 

6  See  A  57  =  B  81  and  Chapter  XI  §  2. 

7  I  take  'Aktus*  and  'Handlung*  to  be  synonymous;  compare  B  130. 


XXI  §  5]  APPERCEPTION  405 

the  judgement  *I  think1  that  S  is  P'.  We  need  not  be  immedi- 
ately aware  of  the  idea  'I  think';  but  it  is  involved  in,  and 
presupposed  by,  the  ideas  of  which  we  are  immediately  aware. 
To  know  an  object  is  to  distinguish  that  object,  however 
dimly,  from  the  states  and  acts  of  the  self  through  which  it 
is  known. 

The  peculiarity  of  Kant's  doctrine  is  that  from  the  total 
judgement  'I  think  that  S  is  P'  he  separates  out  the  purely 
formal  element  (which  is  the  same  whatever  be  the  object 
judged),  and  describes  it  as  an  act  of  pure  apperception. 
This  act,  when  we  abstract  from  all  empirical  elements,  can 
be  nothing  but  the  thought  of  the  necessary  unity  (or  form) 
of  thinking  itself.2 

§  5.  The  Unity  of  Apperception 

Throughout  all  this  Kant  is  attempting  to  analyse  experience, 
and,  by  abstracting  from  the  empirical  elements  in  it,3  to 
determine  its  necessary  conditions  or  elements.4  So  far  as 
these  elements  are  elements  in  thinking,  there  is  a  certain 
difficulty  in  speaking  of  them  as  acts;  for  it  is  the  whole 
thought  which  is  naturally  regarded  as  an  act,  rather  than 
any  element  within  it.5  Kant  himself  tends  at  times  to  speak 

1  A  modern  view,  found  notably  in  Cook  Wilson  and   Prichard, 
maintains,  if  I  understand  it  aright,  that  thinking  and  knowing  are 
fundamentally  different  acts,  the  first  necessarily  implying  fallibility 
or  uncertainty,  while  the  second  implies  infallibility.  If  this  is  true, 
Kant's  analysis  is  defective,  although  not  for  that  reason  worthless. 
Personally  I  am  not  convinced  that  the  modern  distinction — supported 
though  it  be  to  a  certain  extent  by  Plato — is  one  which  will  bear 
philosophic   examination;  and   I  feel  justified  in  following  Kant's 
terminology,  according  to  which  all  employment  of  concepts  is  thinking, 
and  such  thinking  is  knowledge  when  the  concepts  are  applied  correctly 
to  actual — or  at  the  very  least  to  possible — objects  of  experience. 
Compare  Chapter  II  §  4. 

2  Kant,  at  least  at  times,  identifies  this  with  the  necessary  unity 
which  is  the  essential  characteristic  of  an  object. 

8  Compare  A  96. 

4  These  conditions  do  not  precede  experience ;  they  are  necessary 
elements  in  experience  without  which  experience  could  not  be. 
*  Compare  the  difficulties  raised  in  Chapter  XI  §  2. 


406       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXI  §  5 

as  if  the  ultimate  condition  of  experience  were  the  unity  of 
consciousness  or  of  apperception,  rather  than  the  act  of  apper- 
ception which  has  that  unity  as  its  content.  In  the  passage 
with  which  we  are  at  present  concerned,1  his  attention  is 
concentrated  on  the  unity  of  apperception  to  the  neglect  of  the 
act,  and  he  seems  to  speak  almost  as  if  the  act  of  apperception 
and  the  unity  of  apperception  were  one  and  the  same  thing.2 

If  such  an  identification  could  be  defended,  it  looks  at  first 
as  if  we  should  be  compelled  to  say  that  the  act  of  apperception 
is  strictly  not  an  act  at  all,  but  is  merely  a  name  for  the  unity 
present  in  all  thinking.  Pure  apperception  in  that  case  would 
be  equivalent  to  self-identity  rather  than  self-consciousness.3 
Such  a  view,  however,  omits  an  essential  part  of  Kant's 
doctrine,  as  we  shall  see  more  clearly  in  the  sequel.  The  alter- 
native is  to  say  that  the  unity  present  in  all  thinking  or  in  all 
knowledge  is  itself  a  formal  act — if  such  a  thing  is  possible — 
and  one  which  is  conscious  of  itself.4 

In  these  matters  it  is  difficult  to  avoid  talking  nonsense, 

1 A  107. 

2  With  this  we  may  compare  the  way  in  which  he  speaks  of  pure 
intuition  and  the  form  of  intuition  almost  as  if  they  were  identical; 
and  again  his  habit  of  treating  the  concept  of  the  synthesis  and  the 
concept  of  the  unity  of  the  synthesis — and  even  the  concept  of  the 
object  and  the  concept  of  the  unity  of  the  object — as  the  same  thing. 
There  are,  of  course,  differences  in  these  parallels,  on  which  it  would 
be  unprofitable  to  enlarge.  3  Compare  A  116. 

4  The  pure  act  of  apperception  is  an  element  in,  and  a  condition 
of,  all  acts  of  empirical  apperception — just  as  pure  intuition  is  an 
element  in,  and  a  condition  of,  all  empirical  intuitions.  The  peculiarity 
of  the  pure  act  of  apperception  is  that  it  is  the  source  of  the  necessary 
unity  of  all  acts  of  empirical  apperception  (while  the  differences  in 
different  acts  of  empirical  apperception  are  due  to  the  differences  in 
the  matter  recognised) ;  and  it  is  also  (obscurely  or  clearly)  conscious- 
ness of  this  unity.  Compare  A  79  =  B  104  (where  the  concepts  which 
give  unity  to  the  pure  synthesis  consist  only  in  the  representation  of 
this  necessary  synthetic  unity). 

Kant  seems  at  times  to  identify  consciousness  of  unity  with  unity 
of  consciousness;  for  example,  in  A  103  a  concept  is  described  as 
'consciousness  of  unity*  and  immediately  thereafter  as  'this  one 
consciousness*.  Hence  it  is  not  altogether  surprising  if  he  seems  to 
identify  the  act  of  apperception  with  the  unity  of  apperception.

and  those  who  insist  that  every  term  must  be  defined  clearly 
before  it  is  used  will  find  no  satisfaction  in  Kant.  On  the 
other  hand  I  see  no  reason  to  hold  that  a  simple  view,  sharply 
defined,  is  for  that  reason  likely  to  be  correct;  and  I  believe 
it  is  more  important  to  discover,  if  we  can,  what  Kant  is 
talking  about  than  it  is  to  seek  perfect  precision  in  the  definition 
of  words.  Thus  I  think  we  can  understand  what  he  is  talking 
about  when  he  speaks  of  the  necessary  unity  of  the  object, 
although  volumes  might  be  written  on  the  precise  shades  of 
meaning  which  that  term  might  be  taken  to  convey.  What  is 
meant  by  the  unity  of  thinking,  or  of  consciousness,  or  even 
of  apperception,  may  seem  to  some  as  easily  intelligible  as 
what  is  meant  by  the  unity  of  the  object ;  but  I  must  confess 
that  it  appears  to  me  difficult  to  be  sure  what  Kant  is  talking 
about  in  these  terms,  and  only  too  easy  to  imagine  that  he 
is  referring  to  something  quite  different  from  what  he  really 
had  in  view. 

The  phrase  'unity  of  apperception',  inasmuch  as  it  implies 
some  kind  of  self-consciousness,  is  more  difficult  than  phrases 
like  'unity  of  thought',  'unity  of  consciousness',  or  even 
'unity  of  self  and  'self-identity',  difficult  as  these  are;  and 
it  may  perhaps  be  a  help  if  we  keep  these  latter  alternatives 
in  mind  as  expressing  at  least  a  part  of  Kant's  meaning. 
We  must  hope  to  get  a  clearer  view  of  what  he  is  talking 
about  as  we  discover  the  kind  of  thing  he  says  about  it. 
At  present  I  can  only  offer  a  warning  against  two  possible 
misconceptions. 

We  may  say  provisionally  that  in  order  to  know  a  world  of 
appearances  given  successively  in  time,  the  successively  given 
appearances  must  be  known  by  one  and  the  same  self-conscious 
self  which  remembers  the  past  and  thinks  of  these  appearances 
as  necessarily  combined  in  a  changing  objective  world.  This 
does  not  mean  that  the  soul  must  be  a  permanent  substance 
contemporaneous  with  all  our  thinking.  The  whole  aim  of  the 
Paralogisms  is  to  prove  that  we  can  have  no  knowledge  of  the 
soul  as  a  permanent  substance.  On  that  point  there  is  no 
ambiguity  whatever. 


408       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXI  §  6 

The  second  point  is  this.  Kant's  doctrine  of  the  unity  of 
apperception  insists  on  the  necessary  unity  of  thought  or 
of  thinking,  of  an  act  and  not  of  a  substance ;  but  we  must 
not  imagine  that  he  is  insisting  merely  on  a  common  element 
which  we  can  find  in  our  separate  and  successive  acts  of  thought. 
Such  a  common  element  could  be  discovered  only  by  an  act 
of  thought  which  held  before  itself,  and  compared  and  dis- 
tinguished, these  separate  and  successive  acts;  for  we  can 
find  similarities — and  indeed  differences — in  different  acts  of 
thought,  and  in  different  objects  of  experience,  only  if  our 
mind  is  capable  of  holding  these  different  acts  and  objects 
before  itself  in  one  single,  and  (Kant  believes)  to  some  extent 
self-conscious,  act.  The  act  of  pure  apperception  is  not  merely 
an  act  which  on  analysis  we  find  to  be  repeated  in  each  successive 
act  of  empirical  thought  and  to  be  the  source  of  the  unity  of 
each  of  such  successive  acts.  It  is  essentially  a  synthetic  act 
which  is  the  condition  of  all  analysis  and  of  all  unity  found 
by  means  of  analysis;1  and  Kant  seems  to  regard  it,  not  as 
a  series  of  qualitatively  identical  and  numerically  different 
acts,  but  as  one  and  the  same  act.2  As  such  it  is  not  merely 
the  source  of  the  unity  of  each  successive  empirical  act,  but 
is  also  the  source  of  the  unity  of  these  acts  with  one  another. 
Whatever  be  the  difficulties,  and  even  the  errors,  of  his  view, 
I  have  little  doubt  that  he  is  trying  to  express  an  important 
philosophical  truth. 

§  6.  Apperception  as  the  Condition  of  Experience 

We  must  now  turn  back  to  Kant's  own  exposition.3  He  is 
seeking  a  transcendental  ground  for  that  necessity  which  his 
provisional  analysis  has  found  in  experience — a  necessity 

1  Compare  B  133  where  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  is  the 
condition  of  the  analytic  unity  of  apperception. 

2  One  and  the  same  act  of  pure  apperception  is  presupposed  by  all 
our  empirical  acts  of  thinking,  as  one  and  the  same  space  and  time 
is  presupposed  by  all  our  empirical  intuitions.  The  main  difficulty  is 
whether  it  can  properly  be  considered  as  an  act  when  it  is  considered 
in  abstraction  from  all  the  empirical  differences  with  which  it  is 
bound  up.  3  A  107. 


XXI  §  6)  APPERCEPTION  409 

which  I  think  we  shall  understand  best  if  we  regard  it  as  the 
necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  object.1  He  assumes  that  what 
he  seeks  must  necessarily  possess  numerical  identity  or  unity  ;2 
and  he  assumes  also — though  this  surely  requires  further 
argument — that  such  necessary  numerical  identity  implies 
absence  of  change.  Empirical  apperception  cannot  supply  us 
with  necessary  numerical  identity,  since  necessity  cannot  be 
derived  from  empirical  data,  and  empirical  apperception  is  in 
any  case  subject  to  continuous  change.  The  transcendental 
ground  which  we  seek  must  be  independent  of  experience3 
and  must  make  experience  possible.  Experience  in  turn  must 
make  this  transcendental  ground  (or  presupposition)  valid. 

This  view  accords  with  Kant's  general  account  of  formal 
conditions  of  experience:  we  should  be  able  to  find  in  them 
an  internal  necessity  independently  of  experience,  and  at  the 
same  time  we  should  be  able  to  see  that  they  are  necessary 
as  conditions  of  experience.4  If  we  could  not  see  the  latter 
necessity,  they  might  be  mere  phantoms  of  the  mind. 

In  accordance  with  these  distinctions  we  should  expect 
Kant  to  insist  (i)  that  there  must  be  in  thinking  a  unity  whose 
necessity  is  intelligible  ;6  and  (2)  that  this  necessary  unity  of 
thinking  is,  and  is  known  to  be,  a  necessary  condition  of  all 
knowledge  or  experience  of  objects.6  Kant  fails  to  make 

1  It  might  perhaps  be  described  also  as  'necessary  reproduction', 
or  even  as  'the  necessary  unity  of  consciousness  in  the  synthesis  of 
the  manifold  of  all  intuitions';  but  the  difficulties  of  these  statements 
(see  Chapter  XX  §  7  and  Chapter  XXI  §  i)  I  wish  now  to  avoid. 

2  This  implies  identity  or  unity  'as  regards'  the  different  times  in 
which  it  exists;  see  A  344  =  B  402,  and  compare  A  263  =  B  319. 
*As  regards'  seems  to  mean  'throughout'. 

8  Kant  says  must  'precede'  experience,  but  I  do  not  think  this  has 
— it  certainly  ought  not  to  have — any  reference  to  time.  It  precedes 
experience  'objectively*  (or  logically),  not  subjectively  (or  psychologi- 
cally); compare  A  452  n.  =  B  480  n. 

4  Compare  Chapter  VII  §  4  (for  space  and  time)  and  Chapter  XI  §  3 
(for  the  categories). 

5  I  leave  out  of  account  for  the  present  the  question  of  self-conscious- 
ness, which  Kant  elaborates  in  A  108. 

6  This  must  follow,  if  thinking  is  a  necessary  element  in  knowledge 
or  experience. 


410        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXI  §6 

this  distinction  with  sufficient  clarity,  but  I  think  it  is  present 
in  his  exposition. 

He  starts  with  knowledge,  and  insists  that  we  can  have  no 
cognitions,1  and  no  conjunction  or  unity  of  cognitions,2  apart 
from  that  unity  of  consciousness  which  precedes  all  the  data 
of  intuition.  This  latter  unity  must  be  the  unity  of  pure  thinking, 
which  Kant  presumably  regards  as  self-evident,  unless  he 
thinks  he  has  established  it  in  his  account  of  conception.3 
All  representation  (that  is,  all  knowledge)  of  objects  is  possible 
only  in  relation  to  this  unity.4 

As  I  have  already  said,  Kant  seems  to  speak  as  if  this  unity 
were  identical  with  'the  pure,  original,  unchangeable  conscious- 
ness* which  he  calls  transcendental  apperception.  If  we  ignore 
this  complication,  we  may  call  the  unity  in  question  'the 
transcendental  unity  of  apperception'.  If  this  unity  is  properly 
called  'transcendental',  this  must  be  because  other  a  priori 
cognitions  depend  upon  it.  That  they  do  so  is  at  once  clear 
from  the  fact  that  'even  the  purest  objective  unity,  namely, 
that  of  the  a  priori  concepts  (space  and  time)'  is  possible  only 
through  the  relation  of  our  pure  intuitions  to  the  unity  of 
apperception.5 

1  *Erkenntnisse\  here  knowledges' — if  we  may  use  the  word — in 
the  full  sense.  2  Compare  the  description  of  knowledge  in  A  97. 

3  Compare  A  103,  though  it  must  be  admitted  that  throughout 
Kant  fails  to  distinguish  sharply  between  thinking  and  knowing.  See 
also  the  account  of  judgement  in  A  69  =  B  94. 

4  It  would  be  less  vague  to  say  that  this  unity  is  a  condition  of, 
and  element  in,  all  knowledge. 

5  The  'purest  objective  unity'  is  the  unity  of  objects  given  in  pure 
intuition,  since  to  be  objective  the  unity  must  be  a  unity  of  intuitions, 
and  to  be  pure  it  must  be  a  unity  of  pure  intuitions.  The  objects  in 
question  can  only  be  space  and  time.  These  are  often  described  as 
concepts,  though  strictly  speaking  they  ought  to  be  described  as 
intuitions.  Kant  has  just  said  that  the  unity  of  apperception  precedes 
all  the  data  of  intuition :  he  now  asserts  that  even  the  purest  intuitional 
unity,  namely,  that  of  space  and  time,  depends  on  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception. This  is  the  transition  from  pure  thought  to  pure  knowledge. 

I  see  no  ground  for  asserting,  as  Vaihinger  does — Die  Transcen- 
dentale  Deduktion,  p.  52  =  30 — that  Kant  could  not  have  expressed 
himself  in  this  way  unless  the  only  a  priori  concepts  in  which  he  was 
interested,  when  he  wrote  this  passage,  were  space  and  time.  The 


XXI  §7]  APPERCEPTION  4" 

It  would  be  simpler  to  say  that  apart  from  the  unity  of 
apperception  even  our  pure  intuitions  of  space  and  time  could 
not  have  that  unity  which  is  necessary  if  space  and  time  are 
to  be  objects  and  to  be  known  as  objects.1 

The  unity  of  apperception  is  therefore  the  necessary  con- 
dition of  all  our  knowledge  of  objects ;  for  it  is  the  condition 
of  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  space  and  time,  and  there  can 
be  no  knowledge  of  objects  apart  from  a  priori  knowledge  of 
space  and  time.  The  unity  of  apperception  is,  however,  the 
condition  of  the  conceptual  element  in  such  knowledge,2  as 
space  and  time  are  the  conditions  of  the  intuitive  element  in 
such  knowledge.  This  is  one  of  the  most  fundamental  doctrines 
of  the  whole  Critical  Philosophy.3 

§  7.  The  Unity  of  Nature 

So  far  we  have  been  gradually  mounting  up  to  the  trans- 
cendental unity  of  apperception.  We  must  now  descend. 
In  our  descent  we  no  longer  consider  isolated  objects: 

introduction  of  space  and  time  is  essential  to  the  argument,  and 
concepts  without  an  intuitional  element  (such  as  the  pure  categories) 
could  not  serve  his  purpose. 

This  passage  should  be  compared  with  the  corresponding  passages 
about  time  and  space  in  connexion  with  apprehension  (A  99-100) 
and  reproduction  (A  101-2). 

1  Compare  A  103,  A  101-2,  and  B  160  n.  Incidentally  the  statement 
shows  clearly  that  conception  as  well  as  intuition  is  necessary  for  our 
knowledge  of  space  and  time ;  compare  Chapter  V  §  8.    To  know 
space  (or  time)  we  must  be  able  to  recognise  the  common  character 
of  different  spaces  (or  times),  and  this  is  impossible  apart  from  the 
unity  of  thought  or  apperception. 

2  Kant  says  only  that  it  is  the  a  priori  condition  of  all  concepts, 
but  the  context  shows  that  these  concepts  are  treated  as  elements 
in  knowledge.  A  certain  obscurity  attaches  to  the  argument  from  the 
fact  that  space  and  time  have  just  been  referred  to  as  'concepts* — 
which  makes  the  argument  look  like  an  a  fortiori  argument  from  the 
concepts  of  space  and  time  to  other  concepts.  On  the  other  hand,  I 
see  no  difficulty  whatever  in  the  statement  that  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception is  the  condition  of  all  concepts  (and  not  merely  of  the  cate- 
gories, which  Kant  is  reserving  for  treatment  later). 

8  See  A  no,  A  117  n.,  A  123-4,  B  I3^,  and  B  144.  Compare  also 
B  150-1  and  B  160-1. 


4i2       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXI  §  7 

what  we  are  concerned  with  is  the  system  of  nature  as  a 
whole.1 

Out  of  all  possible  appearances  which  can  cohere  in  one 
experience  the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception  makes,2 
and  must  make,  a  system  of  appearances  in  accordance  with 
laws.8  This  system  of  all  appearances  is  what  is  commonly 
known  as  'nature'.4  Kant's  doctrine  may  be  expressed  by  the 
statement  that  the  unity  of  apperception  is  the  source  of  the 
uniformity  of  nature. 

The  paradoxical  character  of  this  contention  is  recognised 
by  Kant  himself;5  but  once  we  ascribe  the  necessary  synthetic 
unity  of  any  and  every  individual  object  to  the  transcendental 
unity  of  apperception,  it  is  hardly  possible  to  avoid  ascribing 
the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  whole  objective  world  to 
the  same  source.  What  is  really  interesting  is  Kant's  reason 
for  coming  to  this  conclusion ;  for  it  shows  beyond  any  shadow 
of  doubt  that  he  takes  the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception 
to  involve  self-consciousness. 

Kant  repeats  his  argument  twice  over.  He  says  first  of  all 
that  this  unity  of  consciousness  would  be  impossible,  unless 
the  mind,  in  its  knowledge  of  the  manifold,  could6  be  conscious 
of  the  identity  of  the  function  whereby  it  binds  the  manifold 

1  There  may  have  been  references  to  this  before,  but  it  is  not  clear 
whether  in  phrases  like  'all  objects' — as  in  A  106 — Kant  is  using  the 
word  'all*  collectively  or  distributive ly. 

2  This  word  perhaps  again  suggests  that  'the  transcendental  unity 
of  apperception*  is  equivalent  to  'the  pure  act  of  apperception*. 

8  A  108,  ' Zusammenhang  nach  Gesetzen*.  The  laws  are  probably 
the  universal  laws  of  nature  set  forth  in  the  Principles  (especially 
the  Analogies),  not  the  particular  laws  which  we  discover  by  experi- 
ment and  observation;  see  A  127-8. 

4  Compare  A  114  at  end.  This  system  may  perhaps  be  'natura 
materialiter  spectata\  the  totality  of  phenomena  (Inbegriff  alter  Erschein- 
ungen)  governed  by  universal  laws;  but  the  word  'Zusammenhang' 
suggests  more  readily  'natura  formaliter  spectata',  the  uniformity  or 
law-abidingness  (Ordnung,  Regelmdssigkeit,  Gesetzmdssigkeit)  of  such 
a  totality.  Compare  B  164-5,  A  125,  and  for  'Zusammenhang'  A  2. 

6  See  A  114. 

6  This  perhaps  implies  that  the  consciousness  may  in  some  cases 
be  'obscure*. 


XXI  §7]  APPERCEPTION  413 

together  synthetically  in  one  cognition.  This  is  elaborated  later 
in  the  statement  that  the  mind  could  not  possibly  think,  and 
think  a  priori,  its  own  identity  in  the  manifold  of  its  ideas, 
unless  it  had  before  its  eyes  the  identity  of  its  own  act,1  which 
subjects  all  synthesis  of  apprehension  (which  is  empirical)2  to 
a  transcendental  unity,  and  thereby  makes  possible  the  inter- 
connexion3 (or  system)  of  appearances  in  accordance  with 
a  priori  rules.4 

The  main  difficulty  of  these  assertions  concerns  the  precise 
meaning  to  be  attached  to  the  word  'function1  and  the  word 
'act'.  Kant  is  certainly  referring  to  a  function5  or  act  of  syn- 
thesis9, but  since  he  has  spoken  of  synthesis  as  threefold,  and 
has  maintained  that  each  of  the  three  factors  in  this  synthesis 
is  both  transcendental  and  empirical,  it  is  not  easy  to  be  sure 
whether  the  synthesis  now  in  question  is  to  be  identified  with 
the  whole  of  the  threefold  synthesis  or  only  with  some  aspect 
(or  aspects)  of  it.  On  the  whole  it  is  simplest  to  suppose  that 
he  has  in  mind  primarily  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination6 — with  the  proviso  that  since  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  at  once  an  element  in,  and  a  con- 

1  This  act  incidentally  is  the  act  which  Vaihinger,  and  to  an  almost 
greater  degree  Kemp  Smith,  maintain  to  be  for  Kant  unconscious 
and  pre-conscious. 

2  Kant  has  previously  said  that  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  may 
also  be  a  priori;  see  A  99.  The  present  statement  seems  due  to  his 
special  concern  for  empirical  objects.  Carelessness  of  this  kind  is 
regrettable,  but  it  certainly  must  not  be  taken  as  a  denial  of  the  doctrine 
that  every  empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension  is  conditioned  by  a 
pure  synthesis  of  time  (and  space).  8  'Znsammenhang.' 

4  These  rules  are  the  categories.  For  the  fuller  understanding  of 
this  we  must,  as  Kant  has  told  us  (see  A  98),  await  his  later  explanation. 
Vaihinger  is,  it  seems  to  me,  Ototv  dta^vXdrra)v  when  he  suggests 
— Die  transcendentale  Deduktion,  p.  50  =  28 — that  *a  priori9  should 
be  taken  with  'mo'glich  machV  (makes  possible).  Compare  the  a  priori 
rules  of  synthetic  unity  in  A  no. 

5  *  Function'  here  seems  to  be  equivalent  to  'act';  for  'identity  of 
function'  seems  to  be  equivalent  to  'identity  of  act* — see  Chapter 
XXIII  §  6. 

6  The  'act'  of  synthesis  in  question  is  explicitly  opposed  to  the 
empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension,  and  therefore  presumably  to  the 
empirical  synthesis  of  reproduction  which  is  bound  up  with  it.  The 
latter  point  is  further  supported — though  there  are  complications 


4H        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXI  §7 

dition  of,  every  empirical  synthesis,  consciousness  of  the  unity 
of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  also  conscious- 
ness of  the  unity  of  every  empirical  synthesis.1 

Perhaps  we  may  put  Kant's  doctrine  best  as  follows.  The 
pure  act  of  apperception  is  consciousness  of  the  necessary 
unity  of  thought.  Such  consciousness  is  impossible  apart.from 
consciousness  of  the  necessary  unity  of  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  whereby  space  and  time  are  held 
together  as  individual  objective  wholes.2  This  transcendental 
synthesis  is  an  element  in,  and  a  condition  of,  all  empirical 
synthesis;  and  consciousness  of  its  necessary  unity  is  also 
consciousness  of  the  necessary  unity  of  all  empirical  synthesis, 
and  so  of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  (or  uniformity)  of  the 
whole  objective  world. 

Kant's  final  conclusion  is  that  'the  original  and  necessary 
consciousness3  of  the  identity  of  the  self  is  at  the  same  time 

here — by  the  statement  that  the  synthesis  in  question  is  in  accordance 
with  rules  which  make  appearances  necessarily  reproducible. 

It  may  seem  obvious  that  the  pure  act  of  apperception  cannot 
involve  consciousness  of  any  empirical  synthesis.  This  is  true,  but 
it  can — and  ultimately  does — involve  consciousness  of  the  identity 
of  every  empirical  synthesis,  so  far  as  that  identity  is  also  the  identity 
of  the  transcendental  synthesis.  Indeed  this  is  precisely  Kant's  point. 
Transcendental  apperception,  according  to  him,  involves  knowledge 
of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  present  in  any  and  every  object  qua 
object,  and  consequently  present  in  triangles  and  bodies,  etc.  The 
matter  synthetised  under  this  unity  distinguishes  one  kind  of  object 
from  another,  and  must  be  known,  not  by  pure,  but  by  empirical, 
apperception.  Empirical  apperception  must  know  the  synthesis  so 
far  as  it  is  particular,  and  consequently  so  far  as  it  is  empirical. 
Transcendental  apperception  must  know  it  so  far  as  it  is  universal 
and  necessary,  and  the  unity  of  every  empirical  synthesis  is  necessary. 

1  Note  the  reference  to  the  manifold  in  both  Kant's  statements.  If 
the  manifold  is  empirical  the  synthesis  is  empirical  also,  although 
there  is  necessarily  a  pure  transcendental  element  in  it.  For  the  view 
I  have  taken,  compare  A  1 19 — 'the  necessary  unity  of  the  pure  synthesis 
of  imagination  in  regard  to  all  possible  appearances'. 

2  Compare  A  107. 

8  This  must  be  the  pure  act  of  apperception,  which  Kant  again 
seems  to  identify  by  implication  with  the  transcendental  unity  of 
apperception,  the  *  unity  of  consciousness'  referred  to  in  the  previous 
sentence. 


XXI  §7]  APPERCEPTION  415 

consciousness  of  an  equally  necessary  unity  of  the  synthesis 
of  all  appearances  in  accordance  with  concepts,  that  is,  in 
accordance  with  rules1.1  Here  the  pure  act  of  apperception 
clearly  involves  consciousness  of  the  unity,  not  only  of  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  but  also  of  the  empirical 
syntheses  which  are  conditioned  by  the  transcendental  synthesis. 
It  does  so,  as  I  have  said,  only  because  the  transcendental 
synthesis  is  an  element  in,  and  a  condition  of,  every  empirical 
synthesis.2 

Kant  is  anxious  to  show  that  all  knowledge,  and  particularly 
Ignowledge  by  means  of  empirical  concepts,  presupposes  the 
necessary  unity  of  apperception,  and  consequently  involves  the 
imposition  on  all  objects — through  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination — of  necessary  synthetic  unity.  This  necessary 
synthetic  unity  makes  all  appearances  'necessarily  reproducible' ; 
and  Kant  therefore  can  say  that  concepts  (or  rules) — even  when 
they  are  empirical — make  appearances  necessarily  reproducible ; 
for  he  has  shown  that  all  concepts  presuppose  the  necessary 
unity  of  apperception.  He  can  also  say  that  these  concepts 
determine  an  object  for  intuition,  since,  as  we  have  seen,  it 
is  the  presence  of  necessary  synthetic  unity  in  appearances 

1  Compare  with  this  the  statement  in  A   107  that  the  unity  of 
apperception  is  the  a  priori  condition  of  all  concepts.  Such  a  necessary 
unity  of  synthesis,  it  is  almost  unnecessary  to  say,  involves  necessary 
unity  of  the  objective  world. 

2  It  may  be  objected  that  the  unity  of  a  particular  kind  of  synthesis 
(and  of  a  particular  kind  of  object)  is  different  from  the  unity  of  the 
transcendental  synthesis,  and  that  every  particular  kind  of  synthesis 
(and  every  particular  kind  of  object)  has  its  own  special  kind  of  unity. 
The  unity  of  a  triangle,  for  example,  is  different  from  the  unity  of 
a  body;  or — to  take  a  more  convenient  case — the  unity  of  a  plant 
is  different  from  the  unity  of  an  animal. 

As  I  understand  Kant,  he  would  have  no  objection  to  such  a  state- 
ment; and  such  unities  might  be  described,  I  think,  as  particular  or 
empirical  forms  known  only  through  empirical  apperception — compare 
Chapter  VI  §  8.  Kant  is  maintaining  that  every  object  must  have  also 
a  universal  and  necessary  synthetic  unity  (for  example,  it  must  be 
a  substance  with  accidents) ;  and  that  this  latter  unity  is  imposed  by 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  and  known  through  an 
act  of  pure  apperception.  What  is  true  of  the  objects  is  also  true  of 
the  syntheses,  and  need  not  be  repeated. 


4i 6       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXI  §7 

which  alone  characterises  them  as  objects.  This  point  he 
himself  makes — although  not  too  clearly;  for  he  equates  the 
determining  of  an  object  with  the  determining  of  'the  concept 
of  something  in  which  the  appearances  necessarily  cohere'.1 

1 ' zusammenhangen.'  Note  that  this  concept  is  the  concept  of  'an 
object  in  general'  which  is  presupposed  by  the  empirical  cohcepts 
of  this  and  that  particular  kind  of  object.  Necessity  belongs  to  empirical 
concepts  only  so  far  as  this  ultimate  concept  is  presupposed. 


CHAPTER    XXII 
THE    TRANSCENDENTAL    OBJECT 

§  i .  Apperception  and  the  Transcendental  Object 

At  this  point1  Kant  gives  us  a  summary  of  the  present  stage 
of  the  argument,  a  summary  which  is  intended  to  clarify,  and 
perhaps  to  correct,  his  previous  statements.  As  he  himself 
says,  we  are  now  in  a  position  to  determine  more  accurately 
the  concept2  of  an  object  in  general,  the  concept  which  was 
obtained  by  our  provisional  analysis  of  the  nature  of  an  object.3 

All  ideas,  qud  ideas,  have  their  object,4  and  they  can  also 
be  objects  of  other  ideas.5  Appearances  are  the  only  objects 
which  can  be  immediately  given  to  us,6  and  that  which  in  an 
appearance  relates  immediately  to  an  object  is  called  'intuition'.7 
The  appearances  which  are  immediately  given  to  us,  and  are 
in  a  sense  objects,8  are  not  things-in-themselves.  They  are 
ideas  which  have  in  turn  their  own  objects;  and  the  object 

1  A  1 08  towards  the  end. 

2  The  text  has  'concepts',  but  this  seems  to  be  a  slip.  The  concepts 
of  an  object  in  general  are  the  categories. 

3  See  especially  A  104-5. 

4  This  seems  scarcely  accurate,  for  the  images  of  imagination  may 
have  no  object  (compare  A  198  =  B  243);  and  the  need  for  a  trans- 
cendental deduction  itself  arises  from  the  fact  that  some  concepts 
may  have  no  object.  In  A  189  =  B  234  Kant  says,  more  plausibly, 
that  every  idea,  so  far  as  one  is  conscious  of  it,  can  be  called  an  object. 

5  This  presumably  refers  to  Kant's  doctrine  of  judgement.  Every 
judgement  is  the  idea  of  an  idea  of  an  object  (see  A  68  =  B  93  and 
Chapter  XII  §  5);  or  more  simply  every  idea  can  be  brought  under 
a  concept. 

6  Compare    A    190    =    B   236:    'appearances    are   not   things-in- 
themselves,  and  yet  are  what  alone  can  be  given  to  us  to  know*. 

7  'Appearance'  here — compare  Chapter  XX  §  2 — seems  to  be  the 
whole  complex  image,  for  example,  this  white  house;  and  intuition 
seems  to  be  the  sensum  which  we  have  at  each  moment  and  which 
is  a  part   of    the  whole  appearance.   For  the  immediate  relation  of 
the  intuition  to  the  object,  see  Chapter  IV  §  2  at  the  end. 

8  The   appearance   considered   in   abstraction  from   the  necessary 
unity   imposed    by    thought   is    an   indeterminate    object   or    'mere 
appearance';  see  A  92   =  B  125  and  A  20  =  B  34.  Considered  as

4i8      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXII  §  i 

of  which  they  are  the  ideas  (or  appearances)  cannot  itself 
be  another  appearance  of  the  same  kind;  that  is  to  say,  it 
cannot  be  an  empirical  intuition  or  be  known  by  means  of 
empirical  intuition.  Kant  concludes,  as  he  did  before,1  that 
the  object  of  these  ideas  (or  appearances)  must  be  an  unknown 
'something',  which  he  here  calls  the  non-empirical  or  trai\scen- 
dental  object  =  x,  and  which  he  formerly  called  something 
in  general  =  x.  The  'something'  to  which  we  refer  one  appear- 
ance differs  in  no  way  from  the  'something'  to  which  we  refer 
another  appearance,  if  we  consider  it  in  abstraction  from  the 
appearance  which  is  referred  to  it.  Since  ex  hypothesi  it  cannot 
be  known  by  means  of  intuition,  it  cannot  be  known  at  all, 
it  can  only  be  conceived  or  thought ;  and  the  concept  of  some- 
thing in  general2,  since  it  contains  no  elements  derived  from 
empirical  intuition,  must  be  a  pure  concept. 

This  concept  of  something  in  general  or  the  transcendental 
object  is  present  in,  or  presupposed  by,  all  our  empirical 
concepts3 — when  we  judge  that  this  is  an  animal,  we  judge 
that  the  given  appearance  is  the  appearance  of  'something' 
which  is  real  independently  of  our  minds.  The  presence  of  this 
pure  concept  in  all  our  empirical  concepts  alone  can  confer 
upon  our  ideas4  relation  to  an  object,  or  in  other  words  objective 
reality. 

possessing  necessary  synthetic  unity  it  is,  as  Kant  is  about  to  insist, 
the  phenomenal  object.  Perhaps  it  is  simplest  to  say  that  so  far  as 
we  are  conscious  of  an  appearance  it  is  an  object,  but  this  must  be 
distinguished  from  the  fact  that  it  also  refers  to  an  object,  or  is  an 
appearance  of  an  object — a  fact  which  Kant  is  about  to  explain. 

1  See  A  104,  where,  however,  the  phrase  *  transcendental  object* 
was  not  used. 

2  This  is  the  concept — it  must  not  be  forgotten — of  the  general 
character  of  'something',  of  its  'thingness'  or  'objectivity'. 

3  This  is  the  reason  why,  although  empirical,  they  involve  necessity. 

4  Erdmann's  emendation —  'was  alien'  for  'was  in  alien' — is  accepted 
by  Kemp  Smith,  and  suggests  that  relation  to  an  object  is  conferred 
upon  empirical  concepts.  Kant,  however,  is  trying  to  explain  how  this 
relation  to  an  object  can  be  conferred  upon  ideas  or  appearances, 
as  is  shown  both  by  what  precedes  and  by  what  follows.  The  original 
text  therefore  seems  to  me  sound,  and  I  have  followed  it,  but  it  should 
be  noted  that  I  have  supplied  the  words  'upon  our  ideas'  from  the 
context. 


XXII  §  i]      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  OBJECT  419 

Since  the  pure  concept  of  'something  in  general'  can  contain 
no  determinate  intuition;1  and  since,  as  Kant  has  argued 
before,  a  'something'  which  is  merely  something  different  from 
all  our  ideas  is  for  us  nothing;2  the  concept  in  question  can 
only  be  the  concept  of  that  necessary  synthetic  unity  which 
must  be  found  in  the  given  manifold  of  the  appearance  and 
*(on  his  view)  actually  constitutes  its  objective  reality.  What 
we  call  the  relation  of  an  appearance  to  an  object  turns  out 
on  analysis  to  be  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  appearance 
itself;  and  this  is  again  identified  with  the  necessary  unity 
of  consciousness  or  apperception.3  It  is  consequently  identified 
also,  in  view  of  the  previous  argument,4  with  the  necessary 
unity  of  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  through  a  common 
function  of  the  mind.  I  take  this  synthesis  to  be  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination,  and  the  common  function 
to  be  the  power5  of  transcendental  imagination.  This  function 
is  'common'  in  the  sense  that  it  is  manifested  in  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination  which  must  be  present  univers- 
ally whenever  we  combine  the  manifold  in  one  idea  (or  one 
object).6 

Kant  now  gives  us  his  final  summary.  The  transcendental 
unity  of  apperception — and  consequently  the  unity  of  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination7 — must  be  regarded 
as  necessary  a  priori ;  for  otherwise  the  cognition  (presumably 

1  It  is  not,  like  empirical  concepts,  derived  by  abstraction  from 
determinate  intuitions.  2  A  105. 

3  Kant  says  that  relation  to  an  object  is  the  necessary  unity  of  con- 
sciousness, and  this  is  awkward  until  it  is  explained,  as  I  have  explained 
it,  by  inserting  the  middle  term.  4  See  Chapter  XXI  §  7. 

6  This  is  an  irregular  use  of  the  word  'function* — see  Chapter 
XII  §  2, — but  compare  the  phrase  'transcendental  function  of  imagina- 
tion* in  A  123  and  also  A  78  =  B  103.  It  is  perhaps  possible  that 
'function*  here  means  'a  formal  act'  (or  'the  form  of  the  act'),  which 
as  such  is  universal  or  'common*. 

6  Kant  has  in  view,   not  any  arbitrary  combination,   but  com- 
bination into  a  phenomenal  object — which  always  requires  the  trans- 
cendental synthesis  of  imagination. 

7  Kant  says  'this  unity',  which  might  refer  only  to  the  latter  unity, 
but  from  what  follows  it  appears  to  refer  primarily  to  the  unity  of 
apperception. 


420      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXII  §  2 

the  idea  or  appearance)  would  be  without  an  object.1  Hence 
Kant  can  formulate  a  transcendental  law  upon  which  the 
objective  reality2  of  ideas  or  appearances  depends,  and  apart 
from  which  they  could  not  be  ideas  or  appearances  of  an  object. 
The  simplest  statement  of  this  law  is  that  all  appearances, 
so  far  as  they  are  appearances  of  an  object,  must  conform 
to  the  necessary  unity  of  apperception  and  to  all  conditions 
which  it  implies — just  as  all  appearances,  so  far  as  they  are 
intuitions,  must  conform  to  the  forms  of  time  and  space.3 

Kant's  own  statement  is  rather  more  complicated,  and  he 
indicates  that  the  conditions  implied  by  the  unity  of  appercep- 
tion are  a  priori  rules  of  synthetic  unity.  These  conditions 
or  rules  we  must  take  to  be  the  categories  to  which  he  is  about 
to  introduce  us.4  Apart  from  them  there  could  be  no  knowledge 
of  objects,  and  indeed  no  objects,  in  the  strictest  sense,5  at  all. 

§  2.  Transcendental  Object  and  Thing-in-itself 

1  have  discussed  this  third  subsection  in  great  detail,  both 
because  of  its  own  difficulty  and  because  of  the  misconceptions 
to  which  it  has  given  rise.  It  is  far  from  being  a  model  exposi- 
tion, but  nevertheless  it  offers  us — as  its  title  indicates — an 
analysis  of  what  is  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  recognition 
in  the  concept.6  Such  a  synthesis  alone  can  give  us  knowledge 
of  objects,  and  these  objects  Kant  finds  to  be  characterised 
by  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  whose  origin  he  ascribes — as 

1 1  believe  that  strictly  we  ought  to  see  the  unity  of  apperception 
as  necessary  in  itself,  and  also  as  necessary  for  knowledge  of  an  object : 
otherwise  Kant's  argument  becomes  circular.  The  same  principle 
holds  for  space  and  time  and  the  categories,  but  Kant  too  often  fails 
to  bring  this  out.  In  this  passage  the  reason  given  spoils  the  argument 
by  giving  it  the  appearance  of  circularity.

'the  relation  to  a  transcendental  object'. 

8  Compare  B  136  and  B  144. 

4  The  unofficial  introduction  of  the  categories  before  their  time 
tends  rather  to  puzzle  than  to  help  the  reader. 

5  That  is,  no  phenomenal  objects. 

6  It  is  obvious  that  the  concepts  employed  in  recognition  are  usually 
empirical,  or  at  least  particular,  concepts. 


XXII  §2]      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  OBJECT  421 

on  Critical  principles  he  must — to  the  unity  of  apperception. 
He  has  still  to  show  that  the  unity  of  apperception  involves 
the  categories,  but,  as  I  have  said  before,  he  has  every  right 
to  reserve  this  for  a  separate  discussion.  He  has  also  a  right 
to  expect,  in  view  of  the  explicit  warning  previously  given,1 
that  we  should  interpret  his  analysis  of  details  in  the  light  of  the 
argument  as  a  whole. 

It  is,  in  my  opinion,  through  failure  to  see  the  argument 
as  a  whole  that  Professor  Vaihinger  has  been  led  to  maintain 
that  the  present  passage  is  irrelevant  to  a  deduction  of  the 
categories  and  inconsistent  with  the  belief  that  there  are 
categories.2  This  theory  seems  to  me  palpably  false;  and  I  do 
not  propose  to  repeat  criticisms  which  I  have  already  made 
elsewhere.3  It  must,  however,  be  noted  that  Professor  Kemp 
Smith,  who  accepts  Vaihinger 's  arguments  and  conclusions, 
endeavours  to  reinforce  them  by  the  contention  that  the  very 
phrase  'transcendental  object*  is  itself  a  pre- Critical  or  semi- 
Critical  survival.  His  main  ground  for  this  contention  is  that 
the  transcendental  object  is  'the  thing-in-itself,  conceived  as 
being  the  object  of  our  representations'.4 

Professor  Kemp  Smith  himself  points  out5  that  even  Vaihinger 
has  not  detected  the  un-Critical  character  of  the  transcendental 
object.  Curiously  enough,  he  does  not  observe  that  Vaihinger 
expressly  denies  the  transcendental  object  to  be  equivalent 
to  the  thing-in-itself :  it  is,  on  the  contrary,  the  object  which 
we,  from  the  nature  of  our  minds,  think  into  appearances; 
it  is  therefore  immanent,  and  is  to  be  sharply  distinguished 
from  the  transcendent  object,  which  is  the  thing-in-itself.8 
A  similar  view,  though  not  without  qualifications,  is  taken 
by  Adickes.7  If  these  views  were  sound,  then  the  transcendental

whatever  in  Adickes.

422       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXII  §  2 

object  would  be — what  from  its  name  it  ought  to  be — an  object 
which  is  thought  a  priori  into  the  manifold  because  of  the 
nature  of  the  thinking  mind. 

It  is  surprising  that  Professor  Kemp  Smith  should  ignore  this 
possibility,  since  the  present  account  of  the  transcendental 
object  has  often  been  taken  as  explaining  away  the  thing-in- 
itself.1  For  my  own  part  I  do  not  believe  that  Kant  anywhere 
renounces  the  doctrine  of  the  thing-in-itself;  and  since  the 
transcendental  object  appears  to  be  identified  elsewhere2  with 
the  thing-in-itself,  there  is  reason  to  suppose  that  it  is  so 
here,  at  least  initially.  On  the  other  hand  Kant's  statements 
have,  so  far  as  I  can  see,  nothing  in  the  least  pre-Critical 
about  them. 

Kant  never  ceases  to  hold  that  the  phenomenal  objects 
we  know  are  only  appearances  of  unknown  things-in-them- 
selves.3  On  his  view  there  are  not  two  objects,  but  only  one 
considered  from  different  points  of  view:  (i)  the  thing  as  it 
is  in  itself,  and  (2)  the  same  thing  as  it  appears  to  us.4  The 
thing-in-itself  is  the  object  which  appears  to  us,  though  it 
never  appears  to  us  as  it  is  in  itself,  but  only  as  transformed 
by  the  nature  of  our  understanding  and  sensibility.  The  thing 
as  it  is  in  itself  is  therefore  the  unknown  object  of  which  the 
objects  known  to  us5  are  the  appearances.  This  unknown 
object  is  spoken  of  as  affecting  the  mind  and  so  causing  the 
appearances. 

We  may  object  to  this  doctrine  and  especially  to  the  use 
of  the  word  'cause'  in  a  sense  which  implies  no  temporal 
succession;  but  such  objections  do  not  alter  the  fact  that  this 

1  This  seems  to  be  the  view  of  Caird,  The  Critical  Philosophy  of 
Kant,  Vol.  I,  pp.  365-6 ;  compare  Cohen,  Kommentar,  pp.  65-6. 

2  See   especially  A  366,  and   compare  A  277-8  =  B  333-4  and 
A  288  ==  B  344. 

3  Strictly  speaking,  it  is  the  matter  of  these  objects  which  is  an 
appearance  of  unknown  things-in-themselves :  their  universal  form — 
not,  however,  the  empirical  forms,  which  are  partly  determined  by 
the  matter — is  contributed  by  the  mind.  Compare  Chapter  VI  §  8. 

4  Compare  B  XXVI-XXVIL 

6  These  may  be  called  'empirical'  or  'phenomenal'  objects ;  they 
are  what  we  ordinarily  call  'things' — houses  and  trees  and  so  on. 


XXII  §2]      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  OBJECT  423 

and  this  alone  is  the  doctrine  to  which  Kant  everywhere 
adheres. 

The  Critical  doctrine  may  be  expressed  by  saying  that  the 
transcendental  object — as  opposed  to  the  empirical  or  pheno- 
menal object — is  the  thing-in-itself.  This  does  not,  however, 
"lean  that  we  know  things-in-themselves  as  transcendental 
bjects,  either  by  means  of  empirical  concepts  or  by  means 
of  the  categories1 — such  a  doctrine  would  indeed  be  un- 
Critical!  Neither  does  it  mean  that  the  thing-in-itself  is  the 
source  of  that  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  for  us  is  the 
essential  and  universal  characteristic  of  all  our  phenomenal 
objects.2  Kant's  contention  is,  on  the  contrary,  that  since  the 
thing-in-itself  is  unknown,  the  necessary  synthetic  unity 
in  question  cannot  be  ascribed  to  the  transcendental  object 


1  I  do  not  think  Kemp  Smith  wishes  to  assert  that  it  does  mean 
this,  but  I  cannot  understand  what  he  does  mean  except  on  some 
such  interpretation — unless  he  is  claiming  as  un-Critical  the  view 
that  appearances  are  appearances  of  an  unknown  object  or  thing-in- 
itself,  which  seems  to  me  equally  impossible.  His  main  point  is  that 
when  the  categories  are  distinguished  from  empirical  concepts — at 
the  present  stage  Kant  is  supposed  to  be  innocent  of  categories — the 
doctrine  of  the  transcendental  object  'applies  the  categories  to  the 
thing  in  itself  (Commentary,  p.  206).  We  might  infer  that  since  at  the 
present  stage  empirical  concepts  are  alleged  to  take  the  place  of  cate- 
gories, these  too  must  be  applied  by  Kant  to  the  thing-in-itself;  but 
on  this  point  again  Kemp  Smith's  interpretation  remains  obscure.  It 
is  not  even  clear  to  me  what  he  means  by  saying  that  this  doctrine 
'applies  the  categories  to  the  thing  in  itself.  As  I  have  said  above, 
Kant  often  applies  the  category  of  cause  to  the  relation  between  the 
unknown  thing-in-itself  and  its  appearances.  If  Kemp  Smith  means 
more  than  this,  he  ought  to  mean  that  we  know  things-in-themselves 
by  means  of  the  categories — a  view  which  it  is  quite  impossible  to 
extract  from  the  present  passage  or  indeed  from  any  other. 

Kemp  Smith  even  maintains,  with  all  the  emphasis  of  italics,  that 
in  the  later  doctrine  of  the  transcendental  object  'Not  only  therefore 
are  the  categories  regarded  as  valid  of  things  in  themselves,  they  are  also 
declared  to  have  no  possible  application  to  phenomena'  (Commentary, 
p.  218).  A  conclusion  so  incredible  ought  to  suggest  reconsideration 
of  the  premises  on  which  it  is  based. 

2  In  an  obscure  passage  Kemp  Smith  seems  to  imply  that  according 
to  the  present  passage  the  contents  of  our  representations  are  grounded 
and  unified  in  the  thing-in-itself  (Commentary,  p.  206). 


424      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXII  §  2 

considered  as  a  thing-in-itself.1  All  we  really  know  about 
appearances  when  we  assert  that  they  are  appearances  of  an 
object  is  that  they  possess  necessary  synthetic  unity,  and  this 
necessary  synthetic  unity  must  be  explained  as  due  to  the 
nature  of  the  mind.  Hence  our  concept  of  the  transcendental 
object,  so  far  as  we  actually  employ  it  in  knowing*  that  appear- 
ances are  appearances  of  an  object,  must  be  reduced  to  a  concept 
of  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  found  in  appearances;3  and 
this  unity,  as  we  have  seen,  is  grounded  upon,  and  even  identi- 
fied with,  the  necessary  unity  of  consciousness.  On  this  view 
the  object  as  known,  or  the  phenomenal  object,  is  composed 
of  appearances  so  far  as  they  are  combined  in  a  necessary 
synthetic  unity.4 

There  is  a  certain  awkwardness  in  Kant's  exposition ;  for  the 
change  in  the  meaning  of  the  term  'transcendental  object', 
even  when  the  reasons  for  it  are  explained,  must  lead  to  con- 
fusion. His  view  becomes  clearer,  if  we  suppose  him  to  be 
analysing  the  concept  of  objectivity.5  He  first  of  all  suggests 
that  the  concept  of  objectivity  as  applied  to  appearances  is  the 
concept  of  reference  to  an  unknown  'something'  independent 
of  the  mind.  He  then  adds  that  it  is  the  concept  of  reference 
to  an  unknown  'something'  only  in  virtue  of  a  necessary 

1  On  Kant's  view  we  could  not  know  that  a  unity  due  to  the  thing-in- 
itself  was  necessary,  even  if  the  thing-in-itself  were  known. 

2  We  may,  and  perhaps  must,  still  believe  that  the  phenomenal 
object  is  an  appearance  of  a  transcendental  (or  transcendent)  object 
regarded  as  a  thing-in-itself.  The  transcendental  object  thus  in  a 
sense  remains  the  object  as  it  is  in  itself  (unknown  to  us) :  the  empirical 
or  phenomenal  object  is  the  same  object  as  it  appears  to,  and  is  known 
by,  us. 

3  Compare  A  250-1  and  Chapter  LV  §  3.  It  is  in  this  reduced  form 
that  Vaihinger  and  Adickes  rightly  deny  the  transcendental  object 
to  be  equivalent  to  the  thing-in-itself.  This  contention  is  very  clear 
in  the  more  'accurate'  analysis  of  Object'  given  in  A  108-9,  but  it  is 
already  present  in  A  105;  yet  Kemp  Smith's  interpretation  seems  to 
ignore  it  entirely. 

4  The  object  as  a  thing-in-itself  or  transcendent  object  is  still  for  Kant 
the  unknown  cause  (or  condition)  of  the  appearances  so  combined ;  or 
more  exactly  it  is  the  unknown  thing  which  appears. 

5  The  use  of  concrete  words  instead  of  abstract  when  we  are  speaking 
of  concepts  is  apt  to  be  misleading.  Compare  Chapter  IX  §  4. 


XXII  §2]      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  OBJECT  425 

synthetic  unity,  and  this  necessary  synthetic  unity  must  be 
imposed  by  the  mind.1  The  concept  of  a  necessary  synthetic 
unity  imposed  by  the  mind  is  the  only  element  in  the  concept 
of  objectivity  which  can  give  us  knowledge2  when  applied  to 
appearances.  We  can  easily  understand  how  the  reference  to  an 
unkuown  'something'  falls  into  the  background :  it  is  ultimately 
abandoned,  not  indeed  by  Kant,  but  by  his  successors. 

The  awkwardness  of  Kant's  exposition  should  not  be  allowed 
to  obscure  the  essentially  Critical  character  of  his  doctrine; 
and  I  believe  that  his  view  is  unaltered  in  the  second  edition,3 
although  the  new  passages  inserted  do  not  employ  the  phrase 
'transcendental  object'.4  So  far  from  not  recognising  the 
phenomenal  (or  empirical)  object  in  the  present  passage,5  Kant 
is  giving  us  in  some  detail  his  usual  account  of  the  phenomenal 
object,  namely,  that  it  consists  of  given  appearances  necessarily 
combined  in  the  unity  of  apperception. 

1  The  difficulty  of  this  is  to  explain  why  we  should  regard  appearances 
as  appearances  of  an  unknown  'something*  because  they  have  a  necessary 
synthetic  unity  imposed  on  them  by  the  mind.  But  this  difficulty  is  a 
difficulty  of  the  Critical  Philosophy  as  a  whole,  not  of  this  particular 
passage;   and  appearances  are  appearances  of  an  unknown  some- 
thing, not  merely  because  they  have  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  im- 
posed upon  them,  but  because  the  matter  thus  united  is  given  to  sense. 

2  We  not  only  conceive  necessary  synthetic  unity,  but  we  know 
that  it  must  be  found  in  our  intuitions.  We  may  also  conceive  the 
thing-in-itself,  but  we  cannot  know  it,  since  we  cannot  intuit  it  (as 
it  is  in  itself);  compare  B  XXVI. 

3  Compare  B  130-1,  B  137,  and  B  142. 

4  Some  of  the  passages  excised  in  the  second  edition  contain  the 
phrase  'transcendental  object';  but  even  if  we  supposed — a  doubtful 
supposition — that  one  of  Kant's  reasons  for  the  excision  was  dis- 
satisfaction with  the  phrase,  this  could  not  mean,  as  Kemp  Smith 
alleges,  that  Kant  recognised  the  doctrine  contained  in  these  passages 
to  be  'completely  untenable*  (Commentary,  p.  219).  Kant  denies  this 
explicitly  in  B  XXXVII  ff.,  and  I  believe  him  to  be  right  in  saying 
that  he  is  only  trying  to  explain  the  same  doctrine  in  a  clearer  way.

VOL.  I  O* 


CHAPTER    XXIII 
APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES 

§  i .  The  Order  of  Exposition 

When  Kant  has  finished  his  analysis  of  the  different  factors 
in  the  three-fold  synthesis,  he  proceeds  to  introduce  us  to  the 
categories.1  In  so  doing  he  reminds  us  once  more  that  his 
present  account  is  to  be  taken  as  preliminary  or  provisional.2 

The  argument  hitherto  has  led  to  the  conclusion3  that  in 
human  experience  all  appearances,  so  far  as  they  are  appear- 
ances of  an  object,  must  conform  to  the  conditions  of  the 
necessary  unity  of  apperception.  The  simplest  statement 
of  Kant's  further  argument  is  that  the  categories  are4  these 
conditions,  since  they  are  the  conditions  (or  forms)  of  the 
thought  which  is  necessarily  present  in  experience.  Such 
in  essence  is  Kant's  actual  contention,  but  he  complicates  the 
argument  in  two  ways:  firstly,  he  describes  the  categories 
as  conditions  of  thought  before  he  refers5  to  them  as  'conditions 
of  the  thoroughgoing  unity  of  self -consciousness' ;  and  secondly 
he  makes  a  fresh  start  at  the  beginning  of  the  subsection,  and 
describes  the  nature  of  'experience'  before  he  comes  to  the 
argument  proper. 

The  description  of  'experience'  is,  I  think,  best  taken  as  one 
of  the  brief  introductions  which  Kant,  not  always  happily, 
tends  to  place  before  the  different  stages  of  his  argument. 
We  need  not  dispute  its  awkwardness,  but  we  should  not 
overlook  the  fact  that  it  helps  to  clarify,  and  in  some  ways 
to  expand,  what  has  been  already  said.6 

The  whole  argument  is  followed  by  the  usual  appendix.7

6  It  may  be  observed  that  Adickes  regards  the  first  part  of  sub- 
section 4  (A  110-11)  as  an  earlier  and  self-sufficient  deduction.  I  do 
not  believe  that  the  difficulties  of  the  passage  justify  such  a  conclusion.

XXIII  §  2]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     427 

§2.  The  Unity  of  Experience 

Kant's  introduction  appears  to  take  its  start  from  an  earlier 
passage,1  where  it  was  said  that  'the  transcendental  unity 
of  apperception  makes,  out  of  all  possible  appearances  which 
cai\  cohere  in  one  experience,  a  system2  (or  connexion)  of  all 
these  ideas  in  accordance  with  laws/  We  are  now  told  that 
there  is  only  one  experience  in  which  all  sense-perceptions  are 
represented3  as  in  a  thoroughgoing  system  (or  connexion) 
governed  by  law.4  This  assertion  finds  a  parallel  in  the  state- 
ment that  there  is  only  one  space  and  time  in  which  all  forms5 
of  appearance  and  all  relations  of  being  and  not-being  occur. 

When  Kant  speaks  thus  of  one  experience  in  which  all 
sense-perceptions  (or  appearances)  are  represented,  we  must 
not  take  him  to  assert  the  reality  of  an  all-embracing  divine 
experience,  or  to  suggest  that  human  experiences  are  part 
of  such  a  divine  experience:  a  divine  experience,  if  it  could 
be  called  experience,  would  have  nothing  to  do  with  human 
categories  or  with  the  forms  of  time  and  space.  On  the  other 
hand  no  individual  human  experience,  and  indeed  no  sum  of 
such  experiences,  can  give  adequate  knowledge  of  all  possible 
appearances  in  the  phenomenal  world.  We  may  affirm  with 
confidence  that  doctrines  of  this  type  play  no  part  in  the 
Critical  Philosophy. 

It  is  less  easy  to  determine  the  precise  character  of  the 
positive  doctrine  which  Kant's  words  are  intended  to  convey. 
If  we  omit  the  ambiguous  word  'experience',  we  may  say  that 
for  Kant  all  possible  appearances  (so  far  as  they  are  appearances 
of  objects)  are  parts  of  one  phenomenal  world  which  fills 
space  and  time  and  is  governed  throughout  by  causal  laws. 
Of  such  a  world  I,  as  an  individual,  can  perceive  only  an

6  These  'forms'  must  be  the  empirical  forms,  the  given  shapes 
and  sizes  and  so  on,  to  which  I  refer  in  Chapter  VI  §  8. 


428    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXIII  §  2 

insignificant  fraction;  and  although  with  the  aid  of  thought 
I  can  know  more  of  this  world  than  I  can  directly  perceive, 
even  so,  my  detailed  knowledge  is  still  confined  only  to  a 
fraction  of  the  whole.  I  do,  however,  know  (according  to  Kant) 
that  the  whole  must  be  governed  by  causal  law,  and  that 
whatever  is  connected  by  causal  law  with  the  appearances 
actually  perceived  is  as  real  as  these  appearances  themselves, 
and  must  be  capable  of  fitting  into  an  experience  continuous 
with  my  own. 

We  may  perhaps  interpret  his  view — provided  we  set  aside 
anything  that  savours  of  mysticism  or  'Schwarmere? — as 
affirming  an  ideal  all-embracing  experience  which  is,  however, 
only  possible  and  not  actual :  actual  experience  is  the  experiences 
of  individual  men.  The  one  all-embracing  experience  may 
be  regarded  as  an  ideal  expansion  or  completion  of  such 
actual  experiences ;  and  actual  experiences  may  perhaps  be  said 
to  be  limited  parts  of  it. 

Kant's  view  will  become  in  some  respects  clearer  when 
we  have  studied  the  Postulates  of  Empirical  Thought.1  It  may 
be  objected  at  present  that  there  is  no  justification  on  his 
premises  for  speaking  of  one  experience,  and  even  that  there 
is  no  justification  for  speaking,  as  I  have  done,  of  one 
phenomenal  world.  To  these  objections  I  will  return  later.2 

Curiously  enough,  Kant  does  not  even  ask  how  the  experi- 
ences of  different  individual  men  are  related  to  the  one  all- 
-embracing experience.  He  mentions  the  fact  that  we  speak 
of  different  experiences;3  but  he  takes  the  phrase  to  refer 
to  different  sense-perceptions,  not  to  the  experiences  of  this 
man  and  that.  His  point  appears  to  be  that  when  I  talk  about 
my  experience  of  this  house  or  that  road,  these  are  called 
experiences,  not  in  themselves,  but  as  parts  of  a  whole  experi- 
ence, which  he  describes  as  'one  and  the  same  universal  ex- 
perience*. 

Here  again,  I  should  prefer  to  speak,  not  of  one  experience, 
but  of  one  phenomenal  and  objective  world,  though  it  is 
possible  that  on  Copernican  principles  Kant's  terminology 

1  See  Chapter  §  L  4.  8  See  Chapter  XXIV  §  4.  8  A  no. 


XXIII  §  3]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     429 

is  the  correct  one.  The  general  tenor  of  Kant's  view  seems 
to  me  sound.  It  may  indeed  be  urged  that  my  experience 
of  this  house  is  an  experience  of  an  object  in  virtue  of  the 
necessity  which  binds  together  the  different  elements  of  the 
house  and  in  virtue  of  the  categories  under  which  it  falls; 
in  short,  it  may  be  urged  that  my  experience  of  the  house 
is  a  complete  experience  in  itself.  This  view  seems  to  me 
to  be  false.  My  experience  of  this  house  is  experience  of  an 
object  only  so  far  as  I  realise,  however  obscurely,  that  this 
house  is  part  of  one  objective  world.  The  categories  by  which 
I  think  this  house  as  an  object  include  the  category  of  cause 
and  effect,  and  indeed  the  category  of  interaction;  and  these 
categories  imply  that  this  object,  like  every  other,  has  its 
necessary  place  in  the  one  world  which  is  the  total  object 
of  my  experience.  This  is  what  I  take  to  be  Kant's  general 
meaning  when  he  asserts  that  my  different  experiences  are 
all  part  of  one  universal  experience  j1  and  his  reason  for  using 
this  language  is  doubtless  the  fact  that  he  regards  the  objective 
world,  not  as  a  thing-in-itself,  but  as  something  which  exists 
only  in  relation  to  human  forms  of  thought  and  sensibility. 

§  3.  Unity  in  Accordance  with  Concepts 

Kant  reasserts  his  position  in  more  technical  language  when 
he  says  that  the  thoroughgoing  and  synthetic  unity  of  sense- 
perceptions — by  which  I  take  him  to  mean  all  possible  sense- 
perceptions — is  the  form  of  experience.  This  unity  (or  this 
form2)  is  identical  with  the  synthetic  unity  of  appearances 
in  accordance  with  concepts?  that  is  to  say,  it  is  identical  with 
the  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  we  have  found  must  be 
present  when  we  judge  objects  by  means  of  concepts.4 

When  Kant  speaks  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  appearances 

1  Perhaps  he  is  also  excluding  what  is  peculiar  in  the  experience  of 
individuals  and  especially  the  secondary  qualities. 

2  Adickes  takes  the  subject  of  this  sentence  to  be  'experience*,  but 
this  seems  to  me  to  give  less  good  sense;  for  we  cannot  identify 
experience  with  that  unity  which  constitutes  its  form.

430    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXIII  §4 

'in  accordance  with  concepts',  he  must  be  taken  to  mean — 
as  in  subsection  3 — in  accordance  with  the  empirical  (or 
particular)  concepts  which  we  apply  in  our  ordinary  judge- 
ments.1 He  now  goes  on  to  assert  expressly2 — what  has  hitherto 
been  implied  rather  than  stated3 — that  if  this  synthetic  unity 
depended  merely  on  empirical  concepts,  it  would  not  possess 
that  necessity  which  on  his  view  is  essential  to  experience. 
We  are  told  once  more  that  such  synthetic  unity,  if  it  is  to  be 
necessary,  must  have  a  transcendental  ground.  Unless  there 
were  in  appearances  a  necessary  synthetic  unity — which  as 
necessary  must  on  Kantian  principles  have  its  origin  in  the 
nature  of  the  mind — we  might  have  a  mob  of  appearances 
thronging  our  soul,  but  no  experience  and  no  knowledge 
of  objects.  Knowledge  of  objects  depends  on  the  connexion 
of  appearances  in  accordance  with  necessary  and  universal 
laws — in  particular  on  the  fact  that  appearances  must  be 
appearances  of  permanent  spatial  substances  interacting  in 
accordance  with  the  laws  of  cause  and  effect.  Apart  from  such 
necessary  connexion  in  appearances  we  should  have,  not 
knowledge,  but  intuition  divorced  from  thought,  which  for 
us  would  be  as  good  as  nothing.4 

§  4.  Categories  and  Forms  of  Thought 

Kant  then  states,  in  one  brief  paragraph,  what  may  be 
regarded  as  the  essence  of  the  Objective  Deduction. 

The  a  priori  conditions  of  a  possible  experience  in  general 
-are  also  conditions  of  the  possibility  of  objects  of  experience.5 

1  Compare  Ai42  =  B  181,  'a  rule  of  unity  in  relation  to  concepts 
in  general9.  2  A  n  i . 

8  It  is,  I  believe,  implied  clearly  enough  in  A  106,  where  the  necessity 
which  appears  to  be  involved  in  the  use  of  empirical  concepts  is  said 
to  possess  a  transcendental  ground. 

4  This  passage  seems  to  me  to  suggest  that  intuitional  consciousness 
is  possible  apart  from  thought:  when  we  assert  that  a  thing  is  'as 
good  as  nothing',  we  imply  that  it  is  not  nothing.  Kant  is,  however, 
capable  of  saying  that  such  intuitions  are  'for  us  nothing' — compare 
A  1 20 — though  this  may  perhaps  mean  that  they  are  not  objects.

XXIII  §4]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     431 

This  is  a  central  principle  of  the  Critical  Philosophy,  and 
on  it  Kant's  whole  argument  depends. 

For  experience,  or  knowledge  of  objects,  two  things  are 
necessary:  (i)  intuition  and  (2)  thought.  Space  and  time  are 
pure  intuitions  whose  content  is  the  conditions  (or  forms) 
of  tjie  intuition  necessary  to  experience;  and  so  all  objects 
must  conform  to  space  and  time.  Similarly  the  categories  are 
pure  concepts  whose  content  is  the  conditions  (or  forms) 
of  the  thought  necessary  to  experience;1  and  so  all  objects 
must  conform  to  the  categories.  The  essential  character  of  any 
and  every  object  as  an  object  of  experience  is  this  conformity 
with  the  categories :  its  character  as  an  object  of  a  particular 
kind  (such  as  a  house  or  a  table)  is  determined  by  the  nature 
of  intuitions  given  in  space  and  time.  The  categories  are 
therefore  concepts  of  objects  in  general  (not  concepts  of  a 
particular  kind  of  object),  and  they  must  apply  to  all  objects, 
or  in  other  words  they  must  have  objective  reality;  for  apart 
from  conformity  to  them  there  can  be  no  object — in  the  strict 
sense — at  all.2 

This  argument  may  seem  open  to  the  objection  that  although 
on  Kant's  suppositions  every  appearance  must  be  given  as 
spatial  and  temporal,  it  is  a  mere  accident  whether  given 
appearances  will  conform  to  the  categories  and  so  possess  the 
character  without  which  they  would  not  constitute  an  object.3 
Such  is  not  Kant's  view.  He  is  presupposing  that  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination  necessarily  combines  given 
appearances  in  conformity  with  the  unity  of  apperception  and 
therefore  in  conformity  with  the  forms  of  thought  in  which 
that  unity  is  necessarily  manifested.4  The  defect  of  his  ex- 
position lies  in  the  fact  that  he  has  left  us  to  connect  the  con- 

1  Note  that  Kant  says  space  and  time  contain  the  conditions  of 
intuitions,  while  he  says  that  the  categories  are  the  conditions  of 
thought.  For  him  *  contain*  (or  'express')  and  'are*  are  interchangeable 
in  this  connexion.  2  Compare  A  93  =  B  126. 

3  This  is  the  difficulty  raised  by  Kant  himself  in  A  88  =  B  121  ff. 

4  Compare  A  108,  where  the  transcendental  synthesis  is  said  to 
subject  every  synthesis  of  apprehension  (which  is  empirical)  to  a 
transcendental  unity.

ditions  (or  forms)  of  thought  with  the  conditions  of  the  unity 
of  apperception  previously  mentioned.  This  defect  he  proceeds 
to  make  good  in  the  following  paragraph;  and  we  must  re- 
member that  he  has  already  connected  the  unity  of  appercep- 
tion, if  not  too  clearly,  with  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination.  He  does  not  adequately  bring  out  the  connexion 
between  the  forms  of  thought  and  the  transcendental  syn- 
thesis of  imagination  till  he  comes  to  the  chapter  on  Schematism. 

§  5.  Apperception  and  the  Categories 

The  possibility,  or  rather  the  necessity,  that  the  categories 
should  apply  to  objects  rests  for  Kant  on  the  relation  which 
he  claims  to  have  already  established  between  our  entire 
sensibility1  (and  so  all  possible  appearances)  and  original 
apperception.  All  appearances  must  necessarily  conform  to  the 
conditions  of2  the  unity  of  apperception — conditions  which 
must  be  identified  with  the  categories.  This  statement  is  said 
to  mean  that  appearances  must  be  subject  to  'universal  func- 
tions of  synthesis1  in  which  the  unity  of  apperception  is  neces- 
sarily manifested.3  These  'functions  of  synthesis'  may  be  taken 
as  equivalent  to  pure  categories,4  that  is,  to  the  functions 
(or  forms)  of  judgement,  so  far  as  the  given  manifold  is  deter- 
mined, or  synthetised,  in  accordance  with  them.5  On  the  whole 

1  A  in.  This  curious  phrase  perhaps  refers  to  space  and  especially 
time  as  the  necessary  forms  of  all  sensibility.  In  B  151-2  imagination 
is  said  to  determine  sensibility  a  priori,  and  this  is  equivalent  to 
determining  sense  a  priori  as  regards  its  form. 

2  This  genitive  is  presumably  an  objective  genitive;  see  A   105 
(where  conditions  are  said  to  make  the  unity  of  apperception  possible). 
The  phrase  occurs  also  in  A  no. 

8  I  take  this  to  be  the  general  sense  of  'Identitdt  a  priori  beweisen 
kanny  ('can  demonstrate  its  identity  a  priori'). 

4  Compare  A  349  where  the  categories  are  descrit>ed  as  'functions 
of  synthetic  unity*,  and  also  A  356  where  the  concept  of  'substance* 
is  said  to  be  used  'only  as  a  function  of  synthesis7. 

5  Compare  B  128.  This  may  be  supported  by  the  fact  that  the 
synthesis  in  question  is  said  to  be  'in  accordance  with  concepts'; 
for  we  may  take  this  as  equivalent  to  'the  .synthesis  of  recognition 
in  the  concept',  that  is,  to  judgement  itself.   But  every  synthesis 
which  is  a  factor  in  experience  is  'in  accordance  with  concepts'  so 


XXIII  §  s]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     433 

I  prefer  to  take  them  as  functions  (or  forms)  of  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination  which  conform  to  the  pure 
categories  and  are  a  determining  element  in  every  empirical 
synthesis.1 

This  general  statement  is  followed  by  an  illustration,  which 
is  top  obscurely  stated  to  be  of  much  help.  Kant  chooses 
*as  his  example  of  a  category  the  concept  of  cause;  and  he  says 
that  it  15  a  synthesis  in  accordance  with  concepts,  a  synthesis 
of  what  follows  in  the  time  series  with  other — and  presumably 
preceding — appearances.2  It  would  have  been  more  satis- 
factory if  he  had  said  it  was  a  function3  of  synthesis  in  ac- 
pordance  with  concepts.  The  concepts  must  be  empirical  (or 
particular)  concepts,  such  as  'fire*  and  'smoke'  in  the  judgement 
'If  there  is  fire,  then  it  must  be  followed  by  smoke.'  Here  the 
successively  given  manifolds,  synthetised  respectively  under  the 
concepts  of  'fire'  and  'smoke',  are  also  synthetised  as  cause  and 
effect  in  accordance  with  the  hypothetical  form  of  judgement.4 

that  this  argument  is  inconclusive.  The  phrase  'synthesis  in  accordance 
with  concepts'  occurs  also  in  A  108 ;  compare  the  'synthetic  unity  of 
appearances  in  accordance  with  concepts'  in  A  no,  and  also  'a  rule 
of  unity  in  accordance  with  concepts  in  general'  in  A  142  =  B  181. 

1  To  take  them  in  this  way  is  to  take  them  as  schematised  categories 
(or  as  the  'rules'  of  the  transcendental  synthesis  conceived  in  the 
schematised  categories). 

2  A  112.  I  should  have  thought  the  concept  in  question  would  be 
described  better  as  the  concept  of  effect  (or  of  cause  and  effect). 
In  A  90  =  B  122  the  concept  of  cause  is  said  to  mean  a  particular 
kind  of  synthesis. 

3  Or  that  it  was  the  concept  of  such  a  function ;  but  Kant  habitually 
treats  the  category  both  as  a  function  or  form  of  synthesis  at  work 
in  knowledge  and  also  as  a  concept  of  this  function  (just  as  he  treats 
space  both  as  a  form  of  outer  intuition  and  also  as  a  pure  intuition 
of  this  form). 

4  The  hypothetical  form  of  judgement  gives  us  only  the  relation 
of  ground  and  consequent;  but  it  is  here  applied  to  a  ground  which 
immediately  precedes  its  consequent  in  time  and  this  involves  a 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.  Perhaps  Kant  wishes  also 
to  indicate  that  the  relation  of  cause  and  effect  applies  in  virtue  of  the 
common  character  which  is  thought  in  the  concepts  of  'fire'  and  'smoke*. 
If  anything  has  the  character  which  is  thought  in  the  concept  of 
'fire',  it  must  be  succeeded  by  something  with  the  common  character 
which  is  thought  in  the  concept  of  f smoke*. 


434     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXIII  §  6 

Apart  from  such  a  necessary  synthetic  unity,  which  is  im- 
posed on  appearances  by  means  of  the  categories,1  apperception, 
as  we  have  seen,  would  not  be  able  to  manifest  its  necessary 
and  universal  unity.  Appearances  (or  sense-perceptions)  would 
then  belong  to  no  experience ;  for  it  is  precisely  such  necessary 
synthetic  unity  which  constitutes  the  essential  nature  or -form 
of  experience.  We  may  put  this  in  other  words  by  saying  that 
appearances  (or  sense-perceptions)  would  not  be  appearances 
(or  sense-perceptions)  of  an  object;2  they  would  be  a  mere 
blind3  play  of  ideas,  something  less  than  a  dream.4 

§  6.  The  Meaning  of  'Function* 

The  reader  may  perhaps  feel,  as  Kant  himself  suggests,5  that 
this  long  argument  has  done  something  to  prepare,  but  little 
to  instruct,  him:  it  has  introduced  a  number  of  theories,  but 
it  is  not  sufficiently  clear  to  produce  conviction.  Many  of 
Kant's  statements  are  open  to  different  interpretations,  and 
between  these  interpretations  the  student  has  to  choose  on 
insufficient  evidence.  Most  of  the  obscurity  is,  however,  due 
to  the  absence  of  a  clear  distinction  between  imagination  and 
thought.  It  is  difficult  to  be  sure  where  the  work  of  thought 
is  supposed  to  end  and  the  work  of  imagination  to  begin ;  and 
consequently  it  is  difficult  to  be  sure  how  the  work  of  the  one 
is  supposed  to  affect  the  work  of  the  other.  We  can  only  say 
that  without  the  synthesis  of  imagination  thought  can  give  us 

1  Or  which,  in  Kant's  language,  has  its  a  priori  rule. 

2  Necessary  synthetic  unity  is  the  essential  character  or  form  of 
an  object  of  experience  just  as  it  is  of  experience  itself. 

3  The  word  'blind*  does  not,  I  think,  indicate  an  absence  of  con- 
sciousness,  but   an   absence   of  self-consciousness   and   of  objects; 
compare  Chapters  IV  §  3  and  XIII  §  4. 

4  They  would  be  less  than  a  dream  because  even  our  dreams  are 
reflexions  of  our  experience.  Though  the  unreal  objects  revealed 
in  them  are  not  substances,  and  though  there  is  no  real  causal 
connexion  in  dream-events,  the  images  of  dreams  seem  to  be  the 
appearances  of  bodies,  and  sometimes  seem  to  be  causally  connected. 
The  real  causal  connexions  found  by  the  psychologist  in  dreams  are 
found  only  when  the  dream  itself  is  made  an  object,  and  are  not 
usually  present  to  the  mind  of  the  dreamer.  6  A  98. 


XXIII  §  6]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     435 

no  knowledge  of  objects ;  and  on  the  other  hand  that  thought 
with  its  forms  is  the  source  of  the  ultimate  principles  which 
control  the  synthesis  of  imagination. 

The  obscurity  of  the  argument  may  be  illustrated  by  Kant's 
use  of  the  word  'function',  which  has  been  a  source  of  difficulty 
to  usjrom  the  beginning.1  I  fear  that  I  am  unable  to  remove 
this  obscurity,  and  the  reader  may  be  advised  to  treat  this 
discussion,  and  the  discussion  of  'functions  of  synthesis'  in 
§  7  below,  as  an  appendix  which  may  be  omitted  on  a  first 
reading.  It  involves  a  certain  amount  of  repetition,  but  I 
think  it  may  be  useful  to  have  a  summary  of  the  evidence  on 
this  difficult  topic. 

The  forms  of  judgement  have  been  described  as  functions, 
functions  of  understanding,2  functions  of  judgement,3  functions 
of  unity  in  judgements.4  The  word  'function'  is,  however,  not 
always  used  in  this  technical  sense,5  and  at  times  there  is  some 
doubt  whether  it  is  intended  to  convey  this  technical  sense  or 
not.6  Furthermore  Kant  does  not  restrict  the  word  to  thought 
or  understanding,  but  speaks  also  of  the  function  of  transcen- 
dental imagination.7  Here  again  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  usage 
indicates  some  relation  between  the  work  of  transcendental 
imagination  and  the  forms  of  judgement ;  and  when  the  word 
'function'  is  used  by  itself,  we  may  have  no  sufficient  ground 
for  deciding  whether  Kant  has  in  mind  the  function  of  thought 
or  the  function  of  imagination.8 

'Function',  it  will  be  remembered,  was  defined9  as  'the 
unity  of  the  act  of  ordering  different  ideas  under  a  common 
idea'  (or  concept).  Though  this  definition  professes  to  be 

1  Compare  Chapter  XII  §  2.  2  A  69  =  B  94. 

3  A  79  =  B  105;  compare  B  128  and  B  131.  4  A  69  =  B  94. 

5  In  A  75  n.  =  B  100  n.,  'function*  seems  to  be  used  definitely  for 
a  'work'  or  'task*. 

6  For  example,  in  A  70  =  B  95  'the  function  of  thought'  (which 
can  be  brought  under  four  heads  each  containing  three  moments) 
may  be  the  'work'  or  'task*  of  thought,  but  it  may  carry  with  it  a 
suggestion  of  'form'. 

7  See  A  123-4,  where  the  word  is  used  four  times. 

8  See,  for  example,  'function'  in  A  108.  9  A  68  =  B  93. 


436      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIII  §  6 

general,1  Kant  seems  to  have  in  mind  the  unity  of  judgement ; 
for  judgement  alone  brings  different  individual  intuitions  (or 
objects)  under  a  general  concept  or  concepts.2  It  is  difficult 
to  connect  this  definition  with  the  senses  in  which  Kant  appears 
to  use  the  word.  If  we  take  'function'  to  be  originally  the  work 
or  task  proper  to  anything,  it  is  used  naturally  enough  for  the 
work  proper  to  a  power  such  as  understanding.  We  can  see 
how  it  may  come  to  mean  the  way  of  working  peculiar  to  that 
power,  or  the  way  of  working  common  to  all  its  different  acts.3 
Thus  the  function  of  understanding  is  to  judge ;  but  the  phrase 
'function  of  understanding'  seems  to  be  used  for  what  is 
common  to  different  acts  of  judgement,  namely  their  form. 
Hence  the  functions  of  understanding  are  identified  with  the 
forms  of  judgement.4  As  Kant  uses  'function'  also  for  the 
'form'  of  an  activity,5  the  forms  of  judgement  are  called  'func- 
tions of  judgement';  and  so  the  functions  of  understanding 
are  identified  with  the  functions  of  judgement.6 

How  is  this  to  be  connected  with  the  view  that  a  function 
is  the  unity  of  an  act,7  and  in  particular  the  unity  of  the  act 
of  judgement  ?  Presumably  because  what  is  common  to  the 
different  acts  of  judgement  is  a  kind  of  unity  which  is  mani- 

1  When  Kant  says  inA68  =  693  that  concepts  are  grounded  upon 
functions,  he  may  mean  that  they  are  grounded  on  the  unity  of  our 
acts  of  thought,  and  even  that  they  are  grounded  on  the  forms  of 
judgement. 

2  There  is  no  judgement  without  conception ;  and  there  is  also  no 
conception  without  judgement,  for  a  concept  is  a  concept  only  because 
it  is  assumed  to  apply  to  different  individual  instances. 

8  What  is  common  to  the  different  acts  is  presumably  due  to  the 
way  in  which  the  power  works,  while  differences  in  the  acts  are  due 
to  the  material  on  which  it  works. 

4  Strictly  speaking,  the  forms  of  judgement  should  be  present  in 
all  judgement. 

6  He  does  not,   I  think,  use  function  for  the  form  of  intuition, 
because  intuition  is  passive. 

6 1  take  it  that  'judgement*  here  is  not  a  power,  but  an  activity. 

7  We  must  keep  in  mind  the  possibility  that  'function*  in  a  more 
general  use  indicates  the  unity  of  any  act  whose  essential  character 
is  to  be  one  act;  for  example,  in  the  phrase  'function  of  synthesis' 
(A  105)  Kant  may  wish  to  indicate  that  every  act  of  synthesis  is 
essentially  one  act. 


XXIII  §  6]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     437 

fested  in  uniting  cognitions,1  and  in  particular  is  manifested 
in  ordering,  or  uniting,  different  ideas  under  a  concept.2 

It  is  this  essential  aspect  of  judgement  with  which  Kant 
is  concerned  when  he  speaks  of  a  function  which  gives  unity 
to  different  ideas  in  a  judgement.3  Every  judgement  not  only 
unites, different  concepts  (or  cognitions4):  it  also  thinks,  by  an 
a'ct  of  abstraction  and  analysis,  the  common  characteristics 
of  different  individual  objects,6  and  so  unites  these  objects 
by  means  of  an  analytic  unity.6 

Judgement  has,  however,  another  essential  aspect,  and  it  is 
with  this  aspect  that  the  Transcendental  Deduction  is  con- 
cejned.  The  same  function  which  gives  analytic  unity  to  the 
different  individual  objects  referred  to  in  a  judgement  also 
gives  unity  to  the  mere  synthesis  of  different  ideas  in  an  intui- 
tion.7 In  this  way  it  is  a  source  of  synthetic  unity,  inasmuch 
as  it  imposes  unity  on  that  synthesis  of  imagination  whereby 
given  sense-impressions  are  combined  into  one  intuition  or 
one  object.8 

On  Kant's  view  the  mind  could  not  by  an  act  of  analysis 
determine  in  judgement  the  characteristics  common  to  different 
individual  objects  unless  it  were  able  by  an  act  of  synthesis 
to  hold  before  itself  at  least  one  such  complex  individual 

1  All  judgements  are  functions  of  unity  (or  unification)  and  the 
functions  of  the  understanding  are  functions  of  unity  in  judgements ; 
see  A  69  =  B  94  and  compare  B  141.  The  difficulties  of  these  state- 
ments I  have  already  discussed  in  Chapter  XII  §  2. 

2  A  68  -  B  93. 

3  A  79  ==  B  104.  Here  it  is  hard  to  be  sure  whether  'function'  is 
used  in  a  technical  sense,  whether  in  short  it  means  the  form  (or  the 
unity)  of  judgement. 

4  According  to  Kant  hypothetical  and  disjunctive  judgements  unite, 
not  concepts,  but  judgements ;  see  B  141. 

5  These  may  be  described  by  Kant  as  'ideas'  or  'intuitions'. 

6  Compare  Chapter  XIII  §  2  and  Chapter  XIV  §§  2,  5,  and  6.  The 
different  forms  of  judgement,  or  logical  functions,  are  the  different 
ways  in  which  this  act  is  performed.  7  A  79  =  B  104. 

8  Compare  Chapter  XIV  §  3.  In  the  Nachlass  4629,  4631,  4635 
and  4638  (XVII  6141!.)  Kant  distinguishes  logical  and  real  functions, 
but  the  relation  between  this  distinction  and  the  one  at  present  under 
consideration  is  not  altogether  clear. 


438      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIII  §  6 

object.  So  much  seems  to  me  obviously  true,  Kant,  however, 
maintains  further  that  the  mind  imposes  upon  sense-impressions 
that  necessary  synthetic  unity  without  which  there  could  be 
no  objects:  we  do  not  merely  recognise  the  synthetic  unity 
of  objects,  for  such  synthetic  unity  cannot  be  given  to  sense, 
and  even  if  it  were  given,  it  would  be  contingent  apd  not 
necessary.  By  means  of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion mind  can  impose  necessary  synthetic  unity  on  the  pure 
manifold  of  time  and  space  which  has  its  origin  in  our  sensi- 
bility alone ;  and  consequently  it  can  impose  necessary  synthetic 
unity  on  the  manifold  of  sense-impressions  which  must  con- 
form to  the  nature  of  time  and  space.  This  imposition  of  unity 
would  be  impossible  if  time  and  space  and  sense-impressions 
were  things-in-themselves ;  and  it  is  determined,  not  by  any- 
thing in  the  nature  of  pure  or  empirical  intuitions,1  but  by  the 
nature  of  judgement  (which  must  itself  be  a  unity  and  which 
must  have  unity  in  the  objects  judged). 

We  may  ignore  the  further  complications  due  to  Kant's 
belief  that  different  kinds  of  necessary  synthetic  unity  must 
be  imposed  corresponding  to  the  different  forms  or  functions 
of  judgement :  this  may  seem  obvious  to  him  and  impossible 
to  us,  but  his  proof  of  it  is  to  be  found  later  in  the  Analytic  of 
Principles.  It  seems  to  me  clear  that,  if  we  speak  strictly,  the 
function  of  judgement  cannot  be  said  itself  to  synthetise  the 
manifold — it  can  merely  give  unity  to  the  imaginative  synthesis. 

The  question  then  arises  whether,  when  Kant  speaks  of 
'functions  of  synthesis',  he  is  referring  to  a  function  of  judge- 
ment or  a  function  of  imagination.  If  he  is  referring  to  the 
latter,  does  he  wish  to  suggest  by  the  phrase  that  the  function 
of  imagination  must  conform  to  the  function  of  judgement  ? 
And  what  is  the  precise  meaning  he  attaches  to  'function' 
in  this  context  ? 

1  The  character  of  the  whole  which  results  from  this  imposition  of 
unity  is  partly  determined  by  the  character  of  the  intuitions  synthetised. 
Thus  one  space  is  different  from  one  time ;  and  although  every  object, 
to  be  one  object,  must  for  example  be  a  substance  with  accidents, 
empirical  intuitions  determine  whether  the  substance  in  question 
is  a  chair  or  a  table ;  compare  Chapter  VI  §  8. 


XXIII  §  7]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES      439 

§  7.  Functions  of  Synthesis 

These  questions  are,  I  think,  hard  to  answer.  There  is  a 
danger  of  reading  more  into  Kant  than  he  means,  but  there 
is  also  a  danger  of  making  Kant's  theory  seem  vague  when 
he  intended  it  to  be  precise. 

•  Kant  tells  us1  that  we  know  the  object  when  we  have  pro- 
duced synthetic  unity  in  the  manifold  of  intuition ;  and  he  adds 
that  this  is  impossible  unless  the  intuition  could  have  been 
produced  by  a  function  of  synthesis  in  accordance  with  a  rule. 
The  rule  seems  to  be  the  kind  of  rule  which  is  contained 
in  particular  concepts  like  'triangle'  or  'body',  and  on  the 
whole  it  seems  most  natural  to  take  the  'function  of  synthesis' 
as  a  function  of  imagination.  Apart  from  Kant's  previous  and 
subsequent  use  of  this  term  there  would  be  little  ground  for 
supposing  him  to  mean  that  this  synthesis  is  a  transcendental 
synthesis2  or  one  which  conforms  to  the  nature  of  judgement ; 
but  it  is  at  least  possible  that  he  wishes  to  attribute  unity 
to  the  act  of  synthesis  in  question,3  and  to  suggest  that  the 
unity  of  the  object  is  possible  only  because  of  the  unity  of 
the  synthesis. 

The  next  appearance  of  the  word  'function'  is  in  a  passage4 
where  the  argument  seems  to  follow  roughly  the  same  line, 

1  A  105  ;  compare  Chapter  XX  §  5. 

2  The  only  ground  is  the  fact  that  this  function  is  said  to  make 
the  reproduction  of  the  manifold  necessary  a  priori ;  but  this  phrase  is 
too  obscure  to  enable  us  to  speak  with  confidence. 

3  The  intuition  is  produced  through  the  unity  of  the  act  of  synthesis 
— there  can  be  one  intuition  only  because  it  is  combined  by  one  act 
of  synthesis ;  and  it  is  the  unity  of  this  act  of  synthesis  which  makes 
a  concept  possible.   This   interpretation    accords   also  with   Kant's 
further  statement  that  'this  unity  of  rule  determines  all  the  manifold*. 
When  he  adds  that  it  'limits  the  manifold  to  conditions  which  make 
unity  of  apperception  possible',  he  suggests  that  the  unity  in  question 
is  connected  with  the  unity  (and  perhaps  even  with  the  forms)  of 
judgement,  and  not  merely  with  the  unity  of  the  particular  rule  or 
concept  employed. 

There  is  perhaps  a  bare  possibility  that  the  'function  of  synthesis' 
is  to  be  identified  with  'the  formal  unity  of  consciousness  in  the 
synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  ideas'  immediately  before.

440      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIII  §  7 

although  Kant  is  no  longer  concerned  with  the  unity  of  an 
individual  object,  but  with  the  unity  of  the  whole  objective 
world.  The  transcendental  unity  of  apperception  is  said  to 
make  out  of  all  possible  appearances  a  system  governed  by 
laws.  The  reason  given  is  that  the  unity  of  apperception  would 
be  impossible  unless  the  mind,  in  knowing  the  manifold,, could 
be  conscious  of  the  identity  of  the  function  by  which  it  combines 
the  manifold  synthetically  in  one  cognition.  Consciousness 
of  the  identity  of  this  function  is  later  equated  with  conscious- 
ness of  the  identity  of  the  mind's  act;  and  it  may  perhaps  also 
be  equated  with  the  consciousness  of  the  necessary  unity1 
of  the  synthesis  of  all  appearances  in  accordance  with  con- 
cepts2 or  rules. 

The  interpretation  of  this  passage  is  difficult.  Since  Kant 
equates  'identity  of  function*  with  'identity  of  act',  it  looks 
as  if  function  were  not  used  technically  for  the  'unity  of  the 
act'.3  The  association  of  'function'  and  'necessary  unity  of 
synthesis'  should  nevertheless  be  noted:  it  occurs  too  often 
to  be  dismissed  as  accidental.  More  important  is  the  nature 
of  the  act  of  synthesis  with  which  the  'function'  seems  to  be 
equated.  This  act  is  definitely  opposed4  to  the  synthesis  of 
apprehension,  but  it  must  itself  be  an  act  of  synthesis  and, 
I  think,  an  act  of  pure  synthesis.  Unless  it  be  taken  as  a  pure 
or  formal  act  of  judgement,5  it  must  be  the  transcendental 

1  It  is  possible  that  this  necessary  unity  is  intended  to  be  parallel 
to  the  system  (Zusammenhang)  of  all  possible  appearances  or  ideas  in 
accordance  with  laws ;  but  this  system  may  rather  be  the  result  of  this 
necessary  unity,  as  is  indeed  suggested  by  what  Kant  goes  on  to  say 
about  the  object. 

2  These  seem  to  be  particular  concepts  like  'triangle'  or  'body'. 

3  'Identity  of  function*  can  hardly  be  taken  as  equivalent  to  'identity 
of  the  unity  of  the  act'.  If  it  could  be  so  taken,  Kant  would  be  insisting 
that  the  unity  present  in  the  successive  acts  was  one  and  the  same 
unity.  Compare  the  numerical  identity  of  pure  apperception  in  A  107. 

4  Unless  indeed  it  is  the  identity  of  the  act  which  is  so  opposed. 

6  Kant  speaks  of  apperception  as  a  pure  act  (B  142)  and  of  the 
categories  as  'acts  of  pure  thought'  (A  57  =  B  81);  and  it  might  be 
argued  that  when  he  speaks  of  'the  necessary  unity  of  the  synthesis 
of  all  appearances  in  accordance  with  concepts',  he  is  most  naturally 
interpreted  as  referring  to  the  synthesis  of  recognition — which  indeed  is 


XXIII  §  7]    APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES     441 

synthesis  of  imagination  j1  and  the  unity  of  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  the  necessary  correlate  of  the  unity 
of  apperception  or  thought.2 

In  the  next  passage3  Kant  connects  the  necessary  unity 
of  consciousness  with  the  necessary  unity  of  the  synthesis 
of  the  manifold  through  a  common  function  of  the  mind,  a 
function  which  combines  the  manifold  in  one  idea.  Here 
function'  may  mean  merely  'work*  or  'task';4  but  it  is  again 
productive  of  unity  and  consequently  must  be  a  unity  itself. 
The  fact  that  the  function  is  said  to  be  'common'  is  of  impor- 
tance :  the  function  of  synthesis  is  always  the  same  whatever 
be  the  special  character  of  the  manifold  synthetised. 

This  common  character  is  further  emphasised  in  a  later 
passage.5  Kant  asserts  that  all  appearances  must  necessarily 
conform  to  the  conditions  of  the  thorough-going  unity  of 
self-consciousness,  that  is,  they  must  be  subject  to  universal 
functions  of  synthesis,  namely  of  the  synthesis  in  accordance 
with  concepts.  Here  the  function  of  synthesis  has  differentiated 
itself  into  the  functions  of  synthesis,  just  as  the  function 
of  understanding  differentiates  itself  into  the  functions  of 
understanding  (or  forms  of  judgement).  These  functions  are, 
as  usual,  necessary  conditions  and  correlates  of  the  unity  of 
apperception,  and  they  are  universally  present  in  all  knowledge 
of  objects.  Their  technical  character  can  hardly  be  doubted, 
and  the  only  question  is  whether  they  are  to  be  identified 

the  subject  of  the  present  subsection.  The  same  possibility  meets  us 
in  a  later  passage  (A  111-12)  considered  below.  I  do  not  wish  summarily 
to  set  aside  this  possibility;  but  on  the  whole  it  seems  to  me  to  give 
a  less  satisfactory  interpretation  than  the  one  I  have  adopted. 

1  It  is  hardly  necessary  to  repeat  that  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination  is  an  element  in  every  empirical  synthesis  and  deter- 
mines the  essential  nature  of  the  empirical  synthesis. 

2  Similarly  the  kinds  of  unity  imposed  by  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination  are  the  necessary  correlate  of  the  kinds  of  unity  thought 
in  the  forms  of  judgement.  3  A   109. 

4  It  might  even  be  used  loosely  for  'power*.  The  German  is  'durch 
gemeinschaftliche  Funktion  des  Gemuts,  es  in  einer  Vorstellung  zu 
verbinderi*.  Note,  however,  that  'Funktionen  zu  urteilen*  (e.g.  in  B  143) 
is  used  for  functions  or  forms  of  judgement.  6  A  111-12. 


442      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIII  §  7 

simply  with  the  functions,  or  forms,  of  judgement  (so  far 
as  these  involve  synthesis  of  the  manifold)  or  whether  they  are 
to  be  identified  with  the  corresponding  functions,  or  forms, 
of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

It  might  be  suggested  that  since  these  universal  functions 
are  functions  of  a  synthesis  'in  accordance  with  concepts',  the 
synthesis  is  most  naturally  taken  as  'the  synthesis  of  recognition 
in  the  concept'  and  the  'universal  functions'  as  the  forms  of 
judgement.  But  it  must  be  remembered  that  every  synthesis 
of  imagination  (so  far  as  it  is  a  factor  in  experience  of  objects) 
is  a  synthesis  'in  accordance  with  concepts';  and  also  that  the 
pure  concepts  which  determine  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination  determine  also  thereby  the  empirical  synthesis 
of  imagination,  which  is  in  accordance  with  empirical  concepts. 
The  example  which  Kant  gives  of  a  synthesis  in  accordance 
with  concepts  is  the  synthesis  of  what  follows  in  the  time  series 
with  other — and  presumably  preceding — appearances.1  Here 
the  form  of  time  is  definitely  taken  into  account,  and  con- 
sequently we  are  not  concerned  with  the  abstract  synthesis 
of  a  manifold  in  general  (which  may  be  thought  in  the  form 
of  judgement):  we  are  concerned  with  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination,  or  at  least  with  the  whole  synthesis 
of  imagination  of  which  the  transcendental  synthesis  is  at  once 
an  element  and  a  condition.  On  the  whole  it  seems  most 
satisfactory  to  take  the  'universal  functions  of  synthesis'  as 
functions  of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.2 

From  this  review  of  Kant's  usage  it  looks  as  if  the  phrase 

*A   112. 

2  The  synthesis  of  the  manifold  in  general — which  is  thought  in 
the  form  of  judgement  (and  in  the  forms  of  judgement) — is  an 
intellectual  synthesis  (compare  B  151,  B  143,  and  B  131).  As  such 
it  is  one  step  farther  removed  from  the  empirical  manifold  than  is 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.  Yet  these  two  syntheses 
are  for  Kant  closely  connected ;  for  if  we  consider  the  transcendental 
synthesis  in  complete  abstraction  from  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and 
space  it  becomes  identical  with  the  intellectual  synthesis  thought 
in  the  forms  of  judgement  (compare  B  161  ff.).  The  difference  between 
the  two  syntheses  is  parallel  to  that  between  pure  categories  and 
schematised  categories. 


XXIII  §  7]     APPERCEPTION  AND  THE  CATEGORIES      443 

'functions  of  synthesis'  played  an  important  part  in  the  argu- 
ment, but  its  precise  meaning  unfortunately  remains  uncertain: 
we  cannot  even  be  sure  that  it  has  one  precise  meaning,  nor 
can  we  see  it  clearly  as  developing  different  meanings  related 
to  one  another  in  a  way  that  we  can  understand.  I  incline  to 
think  .that  the  word  'function*  carries  with  it  the  implication 
of  unity.  Kant's  general  doctrine  is  that  judgement,  and  indeed 
conception,  is  impossible  apart  from  an  imaginative  synthesis 
which  possesses  unity,  and  that  this  unity  of  synthesis  is  the 
correlate  of  the  unity  of  thought  or  apperception.  The  imagina- 
tive synthesis  does  not  receive  its  unity  from  the  unity  of  the 
given  manifold :  rather  it  imposes  unity  on  the  given  manifold 
in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  thought.  This  it  can  do  only 
because  there  is  a  transcendental  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold 
of  time  (and  perhaps  space)  present  as  an  element  in,  and 
condition  of,  every  empirical  synthesis ;  but  whether  the  phrase 
'function  of  synthesis'  is  intended  to  make  any  allusion  to  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  and  still  more  whether 
it  is  intended  to  suggest  any  relation  between  different  func- 
tions of  the  transcendental  synthesis  and  the  functions  (or 
forms)  of  judgement — all  this  is  a  matter  on  which  it  seems 
to  me  impossible  to  arrive  at  any  conclusion. 


CHAPTER    XXIV 
THE    AFFINITY    OF   APPEARANCES 

§  i.   The  Affinity  of  Appearances 

In  accordance  with  his  usual  practice  Kant  completes  his 
argument  by  an  appendix.1  In  this  he  argues  that  only  by 
means  of  his  Copernican  revolution  can  we  justify  our  belief 
in  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding.  Incidentally  he  explains 
what  he  means  by  the  'affinity'2  of  appearances. 

If  there  are  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding  which 
apply  necessarily  and  universally  to  all  possible  objects,  such 
concepts  cannot  be  mere  generalisations  from  experience. 
Experience  cannot  give  us  necessity  and  universality:  it  may 
teach  us,  for  example,  that  A  is  usually  followed  by  B,  but 
not  that  A  is  the  cause  upon  which  B  necessarily  follows  as 
the  effect.  So  far  we  have  the  ordinary  Kantian  doctrine :  but 
the  special  problem  which  we  have  to  consider  is  that  law- 
abidingness  or  affinity  of  appearances  which,  according  to 
Kant,  is  the  objective  condition  of  association  and  cannot  be 
derived  from  association.3 

Kant's  language  is  not  altogether  clear,  and  he  might  almost 
be  taken  to  identify  the  causal  law  of  nature  with  the  empirical 
rule  of  association.4  His  aim,  however,  is  to  distinguish  these 
two  things.  He  believes  that  there  could  be  no  empirical  asso- 

1  A  112  ff.  2tAffinitdty  or  'VerwandtschafV. 

8  Compare  Kant's  criticisms  of  Hume  in  A  766-7  =  B  794-5. 

4  This  identification  is  stressed  in  Kemp  Smith's  translation,  'this 
rule,  as  a  law  of  nature*  in  A  113.  I  should  prefer  to  take  'dieses1 
(which  is  neuter)  as  referring,  not  to  'jene  empirische  Regel  der  Associa- 
tion* (which  is  feminine),  but  to  the  formulation  of  the  causal  law 
immediately  preceding.  Nevertheless  Kant's  language  is  odd  and  gives 
some  colour  to  Kemp  Smith's  view.  It  would  seem  more  natural  to 
say  that  the  empirical  rule  of  association  presupposes  causal  law — 
compare  A  100 — than  to  say,  as  Kant  does,  that  causal  law  presupposes 
the  empirical  rule  of  association.  Our  knowledge  of  causal  law  does, 
however,  presuppose  the  empirical  law  of  association,  since  it  pre- 
supposes the  synthesis  of  reproduction. 


XXIV  §  i]     THE  AFFINITY  OF  APPEARANCES  445 

ciation  in  our  minds  unless  appearances  were  governed  by 
necessary  laws,  and  in  particular  by  the  law  of  causality.1  This 
law-abidingness  of  appearances  (which  may  be  identified  with 
their  necessary  synthetic  unity)  is  called  'affinity';  and  affinity 
is  the  ground  of  the  possibility  of  the  association  of  the  given 
manifold,  so  far  as  such  aground  lies  in  the  object.2  There  must 
also  be  a  subjective  ground :  that  is  to  say,  we  must  also  have  a 
power  of  reproduction  and  a  tendency  to  associate  ideas  which 
have  often  followed  or  accompanied  one  another.3 

The  affinity  of  appearances  might  be  described  in  more 
modern  language  as  the  uniformity  of  nature;  and  Kant 
believes  that  this  is  the  presupposition,  not  only  of  empirical 
association,  but  also  of  all  science  and  indeed  of  all  experience. 
He  maintains  that  it  is  intelligible  only  in  the  light  of  Critical 
principles.  All  possible  appearances  of  objects  belong,  as  ideas, 
to  the  total  possible  self-consciousness.  Such  self-consciousness 
is  said  to  be  a  transcendental  idea,4  and  as  such  to  involve 
a  numerical  identity5  which  is  certain  a  priori*  This  identity 
must  enter  into  the  synthesis  of  all  the  manifold  of  appearances, 
so  far  as  the  synthesis  is  to  give  us  empirical  knowledge.1 
Hence  the  empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension  whereby  we 
take  up  and  combine  given  sense-impressions  must  conform 
to  the  unity  of  apperception  and  to  the  necessary  conditions, 
or  principles  of  synthesis,  therein  implied.  This  means  that 
appearances,  or  phenomenal  objects,  must  conform  to  these 

1  Compare  Chapter  XIX  §  5.  The  law  of  causality  is  only  one  aspect 
of  what  Kant  calls  'affinity'.  2  Compare  Chapter  XIX  §  4. 

3  A  100.  In  Section  3  (A  115  ff.)  Kant  distinguishes  reproduction 
and  association,  but  I  doubt  whether  this  distinction  is  to  be  found 
in  Section  2. 

4  Compare  A  107.  It  is  presumably  transcendental  as  the  condition 
of  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge.  5  Compare  again  A  107. 

6  The  reason  given  for  the  last  assertion  is  'because  nothing  can 
come  into  knowledge  except  by  means  of  original  apperception'.  In 
A  109  this  was  expressed  by  saying  that  the  unity  of  consciousness 
must  be  regarded  as  necessary  a  priori  'because  knowledge  otherwise 
would  be  without  an  object'.  I  believe  that  the  unity  of  apperception 
should  be  necessary  (i)  in  itself  and  (2)  as  a  condition  of  knowledge. 

7  Compare  A  108,  A  109,  A  no,  and  A  112. 


446       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION      [XXIV  §  2 

necessary  conditions.  In  other  words  they  must  be  subject 
to  necessary  laws;  for  a  law  is  simply  the  formulation  of 
the  necessary  and  universal  conditions  to  which  objects  must 
conform.1  To  say  this  is  to  say  that  all  appearances  must 
possess  a  transcendental  affinity,  a  necessary  affinity  which  is 
derived  from  the  unity  of  apperception  and  is  the  condition 
of  experience. 

§  2.  Transcendental  and  Empirical  Affinity 

It  is  manifest  that,  apart  from  the  introduction  of  the 
word  'affinity',  we  have  here  only  a  summary  statement  of  the 
argument  which  has  already  been  expounded.  Kant  does  not 
offer  us  a  special  proof  of  causality,  such  as  is  to  be  found  in 
the  second  Analogy.  He  simply  repeats  his  'transcendental 
deduction*  of  the  categories ;  and  in  so  doing  he  endeavours 
to  show  that  by  his  methods  it  is  possible  to  demonstrate 
such  universal  laws  as  are  implied  in  all  the  categories  and 
particularly  in  the  category  of  causation.  His  exposition  has 
all  the  difficulties  of  the  previous  argument.2  It  does,  I  think, 

1  In  obscure  language  Kant  contrasts  a  law  with  a  rule.  A  rule 
presumably  lacks  strict  universality  and  necessity:  it  applies  to  some 
objects  and  not  to  others  and  is  a  generalisation  from  experience. 
I   take  it,   however,   that  all  rules   presuppose,   and   are   particular 
determinations  of,  these  higher  laws  with  which  we  are  here  concerned. 
Compare  A  126,  which  throws  some  light  on  the  present  passage, 
and  also  illustrates  incidentally  the  fact  that  Kant  does  not   adhere 
consistently  to  the  distinction  between  'rule'  and  'law'. 

Note  that  Kant  connects  'law'  (Gesetz)  with  the  representation 
of  a  universal  condition  in  accordance  with  which  a  certain  manifold 
must  be  posited  (gesetzt) — a  statement  which  seems  to  connect  the 
root  of  the  German  word  for  'law*  with  his  own  Critical  theories. 
For  the  definition  of  a  'rule'  we  must  substitute  'can'  for  'must'. 
I  confess  that  the  word  'posited'  always  puzzles  me :  it  seems  to  imply 
that  a  definite  position  is  assigned  in  a  common  space  and  time  and 
so  in  a  common  world  of  nature,  and  this  can  be  done  only  in  accor- 
dance with  the  Analogies,  which  are  the  ultimate  principles  or  laws 
governing  objective  existence.  The  exact  meaning  of  the  parenthesis 
('mithin  auf  einerlei  Art9)  seems  to  me  obscure :  it  suggests  perhaps 
that  a  manifold  as  'certain*  or  determinate  is  of  a  certain  kind  and 
falls  under  an  empirical  concept.  Compare  Chapter  XXVII  §  3. 

2  Particularly  the  reference  to  a  'total  possible  self -consciousness' 
and  its  'numerical  identity'  in  A  113. 


XXIV  §  2]    THE  AFFINITY  OF  APPEARANCES  447 

serve  to  bring  out  one  point  more  clearly — that  by  no  mere 
accident  does  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  conform  to  the 
unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories.1  The  ultimate 
principles  determining  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  are  to 
be  found,  not  in  what  is  given,  but  in  the  nature  of  human 
understanding  itself.2 

"  Kant  makes  a  further  point  in  regard  to  affinity:  he 
distinguishes  *  transcendental'  from  'empirical'  affinity,  and 
asserts  that  the  latter  is  merely  the  consequence  of  the 
former.3 

.  If  we  identify  Affinity'  with  synthetic  unity,  transcendental 
affinity  is  that  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  characterises 
every  object  as  such  and  is  known  a  priori — the  unity  of  a 
substance  whose  accidents  possess  quantity  and  quality  and 
are  determined  through  causal  interaction  with  other  sub- 
stances. Empirical  affinity  is  that  synthetic  unity  which,  as 
we  learn  from  experience,  belongs  to  a  particular  object  or  to 
objects  of  a  particular  kind — the  unity  of  certain  elements 
empirically  perceived.  Thus  a  lump  of  sugar,  like  every  other 
object,  must  have  the  unity  of  a  substance  with  accidents  and 
so  possesses  transcendental  affinity ;  but  we  know  from  experi- 
ence that  the  accidents  united  in  the  substance  of  a  lump  of 
sugar  are  such  qualities  as  being  hard  and  white  and  sweet,4 
and  it  is  the  unity  of  these  perceived  elements  which  constitutes 
its  empirical  affinity.  The  two  types  of  affinity  must  be  present 
in  every  object.  A  lump  of  sugar  could  not  unite  in  itself  the 
qualities  of  being  hard  and  white  and  sweet  unless  it  were 
a  substance  whose  accidents  are  determined  by  causal  law;5 
and  on  the  other  hand  it  could  not  be  a  substance  whose 

1  Compare  also  A  108  and  A  121. 

2  It  need  hardly  be  repeated  that  this  is  possible  only  on  the 
supposition  that  time  and  space  are  forms  of  human  sensibility. 

3  A  114. 

4  If  we  wish  to  avoid  the  mention  of  secondary  qualities,  we  may 
substitute  such  primary  qualities  as  the  physicist  and  chemist  would 
find  in  a  lump  of  sugar. 

6  Hence  even  empirical  affinity  is  necessary  in  the  sense  that  it 
must  be  determined  in  accordance  with  necessary  laws. 


448      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXIV  §  2 

accidents  are  determined  by  causal  law,  unless  these  accidents 
were  given,  or  at  least  could  be  given,  to  sense. 

Transcendental  affinity  is  thought  in  the  a  priori  concept 
of  an  object  in  general  (which  differentiates  itself  into  the 
categories);  it  is  imposed  by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination,1  which  depends  on  the  pure  manifold  of  space 
and  time  but  is  independent  of  any  particular  experience. 
Empirical  affinity  is  thought  in  empirical  concepts,  for  example 
in  the  concept  'lump  of  sugar';  and  this  concept  is  derived 
from  experience.  The  empirical  concept,  however,  presupposes 
the  concept  of  an  object  in  general  and  the  whole  system  of 
the  categories — just  as  the  empirical  affinity  of  any  particular 
object  presupposes  the  transcendental  affinity  which  belongs  to 
any  and  every  object. 

The  empirical  affinity  of  an  object  cannot  be  deduced  from 
its  transcendental  affinity;  for  in  that  case  it  would  not  be 
empirical.  We  do  not  know  that  sugar  is  hard  and  white  and 
sweet  until  we  perceive  it.  Nevertheless  the  empirical  affinity 
is  a  consequence  of  the  transcendental;  for  all  empirical 
qualities,  and  their  union  in  a  particular  object,  are  determined 
in  accordance  with  the  categories  and  particularly  in  accordance 
with  the  category  of  cause  and  effect.2 

If  we  can  assume,  as  Kant  appears  to  assume,  that  the 
affinity  of  objects  implies  their  relative  constancy  and  the 
repetition  of  causal  sequences,3  then  the  doctrine  of  affinity 
explains  the  objective  ground  for  our  association  of  ideas. 
Certainly  we  could  never  associate  ideas,  as  we  do,  because 
they  are  ideas  of  qualities  of  the  same  object,  unless  we  were 

1  In  A  115-16  Kant  describes  the  pure  synthesis  of  imagination 
as  the  a  priori  condition  of  association.  The  reason  for  this  may  be 
that  the  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  the  ultimate 
source  of  affinity,  and  affinity  is  the  objective  ground  of  association. 

2  Or  of  interaction,  which  is  reciprocal  causation.  Kant,  it  may  be 
observed,  always  insists  that  although  we  know  the  causal  law  a 
priori,  we  can  learn  that  A  is  the  cause  of  B  from  experience  alone. 

3  Kant   seems    to    have   in   mind    association   based   on   repeated 
sequences  as  well  as  association  based  on  affinity  in  the  narrower 
sense ;  see  Chapter  XIX  §  4. 


XXIV  §  3]     THE  AFFINITY  OF  APPEARANCES  449 

already  aware  of  objects ;  and  our  knowledge  of  objects  cannot 
be  derived  merely  from  this  kind  of  association.1  Nevertheless 
it  appears  to  be  theoretically  possible  that  a  world  determined 
throughout  by  the  categories  would  be  wholly  lacking  in  con- 
stancy and  in  repetitions.2  It  is  perhaps  also  possible  that  a 
world  possessed  of  merely  empirical  regularities  would  offer  a 
sufficient  basis  for  association.3  Such  objections  must  not, 
however,  blind  us  to  the  fact  that  Kant  is  attempting  to  estab- 
lish transcendental  affinity,  not  as  an  inference  from  the  fact 
of  association,  but  by  an  independent  proof.

§  3.  The  Unity  of  Nature 

Kant  recognises  the  paradoxical  character  of  a  doctrine 
which  makes  the  uniformity  and  unity  of  nature  depend  on  the 
character  of  human  apperception.4  This  difficulty  disappears 
once  we  understand  that  nature,  as  we  know  it,  is  not  a  thing- 
in-itself,  but  an  aggregate  of  appearances.  On  such  a  view  the 
unity  of  nature  can  be  derived  from,  or  even  identified  with, 
the  unity  of  apperception  and  can  be  known  as  necessary 
independently  of  experience.  If  on  the  other  hand  nature 
were  an  aggregate  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves,  we 
might  recognise  a  matter-of-fact  unity  in  individual  objects 
and  suppose  that  a  similar  unity  might  be  found  in  other 
objects ;  but  we  could  never  know  that  nature  must  be  a  unity 
and  must  be  governed  throughout  by  law.6  Many  philosophers 
to-day  would  accept  the  view  that  we  possess  no  such  a  priori 
knowledge  of  nature  and  its  laws.  Kant  believes  that  to  accept 

1  Similarly  we  could  never  associate  ideas,  as  we  do,  because  of  an 
objective  contiguity,  unless  we  were  already  aware  of  this  objective 
contiguity ;  and  this  awareness,  according  to  Kant,  already  presupposes 
the  law  of  cause  and  effect.  Hence  our  knowledge  of  cause  and  effect 
cannot  be  derived  merely  from  association  by  contiguity. 

2  Kant  seems  himself  to  recognise  this  possibility,  though  in  a 
different  connexion,  in  A  653  =  B  681.  A  discussion  of  the  doctrine 
of  affinity  in  this  part  of  his  work — see  especially  A  657  =  B  685  ff. 
— would  take  us  too  far  from  our  present  subject.  See  also  Chapter 
XLV  §  7.  3  See  Chapter  XIX  §  5.

this  view  is  to  cut  away  the  foundations  of  science  and  to 
make  the  world  of  experience  indistinguishable  from  the 
world  of  dreams. 

§  4.  The  One  All-embracing  Experience 

Kant's  insistence  that  nature  is  essentially  the  object  of  a}l 
possible  experience,1  and  again  that  all  possible  appearances 
belong  as  ideas  to  the  total  possible  self-consciousness,2  raises 
once  more  the  question,  to  which  I  have  already  alluded,3 
whether  Kant  is  entitled,  on  his  premises,  to  speak  of  one 
experience  or  even  of  one  phenomenal  world. 

Let  as  assume  that  there  is  a  world  which  is  real  indepen- 
dently of  our  knowing,  but  that  we  know  this  world  only  as 
it  must  appear  to  us,  and  not  as  it  is  in  itself.  Of  this  world 
in  its  own  inner  nature  we  know,  and  can  know,  nothing; 
but  we  know  that  in  relation  to  human  minds  it  must  appear 
as  a  world  of  substances  interacting  in  time  and  space.  The 
spatial  and  temporal  world  of  interacting  substances  is  the 
phenomenal  world  which  we  know  as  'nature'.  Its  character 
as  spatial  and  temporal  is  due  to  the  nature  of  human  sensibility ; 
and  the  ultimate  laws  by  which  it  is  governed  are  due  to  the 
nature  of  human  thought,  since  thought  imposes  universal 
principles  of  synthesis  on  the  acts  of  imagination  whereby  we 
take  up  and  combine  what  is  given  in  time  and  space.  The 
empirical  differences  of  things  are  due  to  the  nature  of  things- 
in-themselves ;  but  even  these  empirical  differences  must 
conform  to,  and  so  be  transformed  by,  the  universal  charac- 
teristics imposed  by  the  mind.  Thus  it  is  due  to  something 
in  the  nature  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves  that  one  body 
in  the  phenomenal  world  appears  as  a  cube  and  another  as 
a  sphere;  but  if  space  is  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensiblity, 
the  something  in  question  cannot  with  any  justification  be 
regarded  as  the  shape  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves.4 
Similarly  it  must  be  due  to  something  in  the  nature  of  things 

1  A  114.  2  A  113.  3  See  Chapter  XXIII  §  2. 

*  Compare  Chapter  VI  §  8. 


XXIV  §4]     THE  AFFINITY  OF  APPEARANCES  451 

as  they  are  in  themselves  that  A  appears  as  the  cause  of  B  and 
not  of  C;  but  since  causality  is  imposed  by  the  nature  of  the 
mind,  we  cannot  with  any  justification  regard  the  something 
in  question  as  a  causal  relation  holding  between  things  as 
they  are  in  themselves. 

Even  if  we  grant  all  this,  and  grant  that  different  human 
beings  possess  powers  of  sensibility  and  thought  which  are 
identical  as  regards  their  forms,  it  may  be  objected  that  there 
would  be,  not  one  experience,  but  several  similar  experiences ; 
md  even  that  there  would  be  not  one  phenomenal  world,  but 
several  similar  phenomenal  worlds.  The  experiences  and  the 
worlds  would  be  at  least  numerically  different ;  for  the  indivi- 
duals who  possess  these  experiences  and  are  aware  of  these 
worlds  are  numerically  different. 

I  have  not  found  in  Kant  any  attempt  to  answer  this  type 
rf  objection,  which  I  have  touched  upon  already  in  regard  to 
space  and  time.1  I  then  suggested,  tentatively,  that  there  is 
some  difficulty  in  supposing  that  when  each  of  two  men  is 
aware  of  one  infinite  and  homogeneous  space  (or  time),  the 
space  (or  time)  of  which  one  is  aware  is  different  from  the 
space  (or  time)  of  which  the  other  is  aware.  The  same  difficulty 
arises  when  we  come  to  consider  the  phenomenal  world  in 
space  and  time.  If  the  phenomenal  world  which  I  experience 
is  precisely  the  same  in  character  as  the  phenomenal  world 
which  you  experience,  are  we  justified  in  saying  that  there 
must  be  two  numerically  different  phenomenal  worlds,  simply 
because  you  and  I  are  numerically  different  persons?  We 
should  never  dream  of  maintaining  this,  if  the  world  experienced 
were  regarded  as  a  thing-in-itself .  Are  we  compelled  to  maintain 
it,  if  the  world  experienced  is  one  which  exists  only  in  relation 
to  the  human  mind  ? 

It  seems  to  me  difficult  to  give  a  confident  answer  to  this 
question.  If  we  think  of  different  human  experiences  on  the 
analogy  of  a  series  of  mirrors  which  reflect,  and  by  reflecting 
distort  in  precisely  the  same  way,  an  independent  physical 
world,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  even  if  all  the  reflexions 
1  See  Chapter  VIII  §  7. 


452       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIV  §  4 

could  be  precisely  the  same  in  character,1  they  would  never- 
theless be  numerically  different.  The  reflexions  would,  how- 
ever, occupy  different  spaces  or  times,  and  this  fact  might  be 
the  source  of  their  numerical  difference.2 

It  will  no  doubt  be  said  that  different  human  experiences 
also  occupy  different  periods  of  time  and  even  that  they  reflect 
the  world  from  different  points  in  space.  But  the  phenomenal 
world  of  which  Kant  is  thinking  is  primarily  the  physical 
world  as  it  is  known  to  science ;  and  to  that  world  the  differences 
in  the  time  and, place  of  human  perceptions  are  irrelevant.3 
Kant  is  an  empirical  realist,  and  he  believes  that  science  is 
justified,  from  its  own  point  of  view,  in  treating  the  physical 
world  as  a  thing-in-itself.4  But  he  is  also  a  transcendental 
idealist,  and  he  believes  that  the  physical  world  exists  only 
in  relation  to  human  sensibility  and  human  thought  in  general, 
even  when  we  eliminate  from  it  those  differences  which  depend 
on  our  individual  sense-organs  and  the  position  of  our  bodies 
in  space. 

It  is  for  this  reason  that  Kant  can  speak  of  'one  and  the  same 
universal  experience',5  and  even  of  'the  total  possible  self- 
consciousness'6  to  which  all  appearances  belong.  The  whole 
phenomenal  world  of  science  is  simply  the  content  of  one 
ideal  human  experience;  for  it  is  the  real  world,  not  as  it  is 
in  itself,  but  as  it  must  appear  to  all  minds  which  share  the 
same  forms  of  sensibility  and  of  thought. 

There  are  of  course  as  many  human  experiences  as  there 
are  men  and  women ;  and  these  human  experiences  differ,  not 
only  numerically,  but  also  qualitatively.  But  each  contains 
within  it  elements  of  the  one  ideal  experience,  so  far  as  each 
human  being  is  able  to  distinguish  the  real  world  as  it  must 
appear  to  all  human  minds  from  the  real  world  as  it  must 

1This  is  not  really  possible,  for  the  mirrors  would  either  reflect 
reality  from  a  different  point  of  view,  or  if  they  reflected  it  from  the 
same  point  of  view,  would  do  so  at  different  times. 

2  Compare  Kant's  treatment  of  the  Identity  of  Indiscernibles  in 
A  263-4  =  B  319-20,  A  272  =  B  328,  A  281  =  B  337-8.

appear  to  an  individual  possessing  his  particular  sense-organs 
and  his  position  in  space  and  time.  Furthermore  it  is  possible 
for  more  and  more  of  this  ideal  experience  to  become  a  part 
of  my  individual  experience ;  for  since  the  phenomenal  world 
must  be  governed  throughout  by  the  same  ultimate  laws,  it  is 
possible  for  me  to  extend  indefinitely  my  knowledge  of  the 
phenomenal  world  in  time  and  space.  For  this  reason  we  might 
perhaps  say  that  the  one  ideal  experience  is  'obscurely'  present 
in  my  experience,  so  far  as  our  conscious  knowledge  of  the 
phenomenal  world  implies  further  knowledge  of  which  we  are 
unconscious. 

I  cannot  see  that  this  view  of  the  world  is  ab  initio  an  impos- 
sible one.  Many  of  the  objections  commonly  brought  against 
it  presuppose  the  realistic  assumptions  which  Kant  is  en- 
deavouring to  overthrow.  It  seems  to  me  both  possible,  and 
even  probable,  that  in  science  we  know  the  world,  not  as  it  is 
in  itself,  but  as  it  must  appear  to  human  minds.  If  we  know 
the  world  only  as  it  must  appear  to  human  minds,  may  there 
not  still  be  only  one  phenomenal  world  for  us  to  know?  And 
may  not  this  phenomenal  world  be  described  as  essentially  the 
object  of  one  ideal  experience  in  which  we  imperfectly  share? 

What  is  really  baffling  in  such  transcendental  idealism  is  the 
complications  to  which  it  gives  rise  as  soon  as  we  begin  to  take 
into  account  secondary  qualities  and  the  differences  in  our 
individual  human  experiences;  for  these  also  are  apparently 
subject  to  the  laws  of  causation,  and  ultimately  must  find  their 
place  in  one  ideal  experience  and  one  phenomenal  world. 
But  for  the  present  we  must  set  these  difficulties  aside.

THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION 
OF  THE  CATEGORIES 


CHAPTER    XXV 
THE   PROGRESSIVE   EXPOSITION 

§  i.  The  Authoritative  Exposition 

It  is  natural  to  hope  that  the  final  or  authoritative  exposition 
of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  will  be  easy,  after  so  much 
time  has  been  spent  in  working  out  the  details.  This  hope  is 
doomed  to  disappointment.  The  authoritative  exposition  would 
•be  unintelligible  without  the  help  of  the  provisional  exposition ; 
but  even  with  all  the  help  that  has  been  given  us,  it  remains 
one  of  the  most  difficult  chapters  in  the  whole  Kritik. 

The  provisional  exposition  has  shown  us  that  the  proper 
starting-point  for  a  Transcendental  Deduction  is  the  unity 
of  apperception.  In  this  way  alone  can  we  get  a  progressive, 
or  synthetic,  argument  from  the  condition  to  the  conditioned, 
and  it  is  this  type  of  argument  which  the  Kritik  professes  to 
give.1  But  in  its  own  method  the  provisional  exposition  is, 
for  the  most  part,  analytic  or  regressive;  it  moves  from  the 
conditioned  to  the  condition,  as  is  natural  in  a  preparatory 
statement. 

The  authoritative  exposition  begins,  as  we  should  expect, 
with  the  unity  of  apperception,  and  offers  us  a  progressive 
or  synthetic  argument.2  This  argument  it  completes  by  a 
longer  exposition,3  which  follows  the  lines  of  the  provisional 
exposition  pretty  closely,  and  so  helps  us  to  understand 
Kant's  final  statement  in  the  light  of  his  preparatory  dis- 
cussion. 

Kant  could  perhaps  have  made  his  position  clearer  by 
another  method,  but  there  is  no  difficulty  in  understanding 
why  his  final  exposition  falls  into  two  parts,  the  first  beginning 
with  the  unity  of  apperception,  and  the  second  beginning  with 
sense-perception. 

1  The  Prolegomena  offers  us  an  analytic,  or  regressive,  argument.

458      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION        [XXV  §  2 

As  usual,  there  is  an  introduction1  and  an  appendix.2  This 
appendix  is  followed  by  a  summary  description  of  the  Trans- 
cendental Deduction  as  a  whole.3 

§2.  The  Unity  of  Apperception 

'  We  are  conscious  a  priori  of  our  own  self-identity  in  relation 
to  all  ideas  which  can  belong  to  our  knowledge.'* 

Knowledge  is  for  Kant  knowledge  of  objects  given  in 
intuition.  He  seems  to  believe,  as  Leibniz  does,  that  intuitions 
may  be  unconscious;  but  if  they  are  to  mean  anything  to  us, 
they  must  be  'taken  up'  into  consciousness,  or,  in  other  words, 
they  must  be  ' apprehended'. 

At  times  Kant  speaks  as  if  intuition  meant  direct  sense- 
perception;  at  other  times  as  if  intuition  meant  something 
much  wider.  Intuitions,  he  says  here,  may  'flow  into'5  con- 
sciousness directly  or  indirectly.  If  we  see  a  fire,  the  intuition 
flows  into  consciousness  directly.  If  we  see  some  burnt-out 
ashes,  and  judge  that  there  was  a  fire,  the  intuition6  flows  into 
consciousness  indirectly. 

For  knowledge  it  is  not  enough  that  one  intuition  should 
be  taken  up  into  one  consciousness,  and  another  intuition  into 
another  consciousness.  If  an  intuition  is  to  be  an  idea  of 
'something',  it  must  belong  to  one  consciousness,  along  with 
all  other  ideas;7  or  at  any  rate  it  must  be  capable  of  being 
combined  with  all  other  ideas  in  one  consciousness. 

A  succession  of  isolated  and  momentary  consciousnesses 
could  never  give  us  even  knowledge  of  the  succession  of  ideas, 
let  alone  knowledge  of  objects.  If  our  ideas  are  to  be  ideas  of 

1  A  115-16.  The  introduction  summarises  the  provisional  exposition 
and  leads  up  to  the  unity  of  apperception.  The  main  interest  of  it 
is  the  description  of  empirical  apperception ;  compare  Chapter  XXI  §  3.

5  Kemp  Smith  translates  *  participate  in',  but  'einfliessen*  may  be 
connected  with  the  technical  term  'influence'  (Einfluss).  One  substance 
'influences'  or  'flows  into'  another,  when  it  causally  determines  the 
attributes  of  another.  This  word  is  used  by  analogy  for  the  action 
of  things-in-themselves  in  giving  appearances  to  us. 

6  Such  an  'intuition'  is  constructed  in  imagination. 

7  That  is,  with  all  other  ideas  which  are  ideas  of  objects. 


XXV  §  3]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  459 

an  object,  they  must  be  present  to  the  same  consciousness. 
This  means  that  if  our  ideas  are  to  be  ideas  of  an  object  in 
a  world  of  objects,1  they  must  belong,  with  all  other  ideas, 
to  one  and  the  same  consciousness  which  is  aware  of  one 
objective  world. 

Needless  to  say  we  are  not  at  any  moment  consciously  aware 
6f  all  the  appearances  of  all  objects,2  nor  can  we  consciously 
combine  the  given  momentary  appearance  with  all  other 
appearances.  This  does  not  alter  the  fact  that  every  given 
appearance  must  be  capable  of  being  combined  in  one  conscious- 
ness with  all  other  appearances.  When  we  regard  it  as  the 
appearance  of  an  object,  we  imply  that  it  is  capable  of  being 
so  combined.3 

§3.  The  Unity  of  the  Manifold 

We  are  conscious  of  self-identity  in  relation  to  all  ideas, 
and  all  ideas  must  belong  to  one  consciousness.  These  state- 
ments are,  for  Kant,  different  ways  of  expressing  the  same 
truth.  The  unity  of  apperception  is  impossible  apart  from  the 
unity  of  the  known  manifold,  and  the  unity  of  the  known  mani- 
fold is  impossible  apart  from  the  unity  of  apperception. 

If  we  distinguish  these  two  unities — Kant  himself  speaks 
often  as  if  there  were  only  one — we  must  say  that  the  unity 
of  apperception  is  the  source  of  all  unity,  for  the  manifold 
as  given  has  no  unity  of  its  own.  The  unity  of  apperception 
is  original  and  not  derivative;  it  is  necessary  whatever  be  the 
matter  given  to  thought.  But  it  is  not  self-sufficient;  for  all 
thinking4  is  ultimately  about  a  matter  given  to  thought,  and 
this  matter  it  unites  under  concepts.  Hence  pure  apperception 
gives  us  our  first  principle — the  transcendental  principle  of 

1  To  be  an  object  is  to  have  a  necessary  place  in  the  law-abiding 
system  of  nature.  Through  lack  of  this  objects  in  dreams  are  not 
objects  in  the  strict  sense.  2  Or  even  of  any  single  object. 

8  Kant  may  also  be  referring  to  appearances  which  are  not  actually 
given  to  consciousness,  but  have  a  kind  of  existence  as  related  to  a 
possible  consciousness.  See  A  120  and  Chapter  XXVI  §  2. 

4  That  is,  the  thinking  of  finite  beings  in  general,  and  of  man  in 
particular. 


460      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXV  §  4 

the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  all  our  ideas, 
and  consequently  in  all  possible  intuitions.1 

Such  a  unity  is  the  unity  of  intuitions,  so  far  as  they 
are  intuitions  of  an  object  in  a  world  of  objects.  It  is 
obviously  a  synthetic  unity,  a  unity  of  different  intuitions, 
not  a  blank  or  empty  unity,  such  as  is  thought  in  the  category 
of  that  name.2 

It  is  absolutely  necessary  to  realise  that  in  all  this  Kant 
is  speaking  of  an  objective  unity,  or  of  unity  which  exists  for 
thought.  He  is  not  saying  merely  that  an  idea  must  be  an  idea 
of  some  mind,  or  even  that  ideas,  to  constitute  any  sort  of 
whole,  must  be  ideas  of  one  and  the  same  mind.  This  would 
be  true  of  any  image  or  illusion  or  fiction,  and  from  this  we 
could  make  no  inference  to  the  kind  of  unity  involved;  we 
could  only  say  that  there  must  be  some  sort  of  unity.  What 
Kant  is  arguing  is  this — that  if  an  idea  is  to  belong  to  knowledge , 
or  to  be  an  idea  of  an  object,  it  must  conform  to  the  unity  of 
the  thinking  (and  not  merely  of  the  imagining  or  sensing) 
mind.3  Without  thought  there  could  be  for  us  no  object;  and 
thought  must  have  unity  in  itself  and  in  its  object.  It  is  because 
thought  or  judgement  asserts  connexion  in  the  given,  and  does 
so  in  accordance  with  certain  necessary  forms,  that  we  can 
affirm  a  priori  the  necessary  unity  of  the  object,  and  specify 
the  forms  which  that  necessary  unity  must  take. 

§  4.  Empirical  and  Transcendental  Consciousness 

The  transcendental  principle  of  necessary  synthetic  unity 
is  elaborated  in  a  very  important  note.4 

1 A  116-17.  The  word  *  transcendental*  shows  that  the  synthetic 
unity  is  (i)  a  necessary  condition  of  experience,  and  (2)  due  to  the

2  See  B  131  and  B  114,  and  compare  Chapter  XXVIII  §  4  towards

theme  in  a  play.

XXV  §  4]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  461 

Kant  is  not  stating  the  obvious  fact  that  ideas  exist  only 
in  consciousness,  or,  in  his  language,  that  they  have  a  necessary 
relation  to  a  possible  empirical  consciousness.  What  he  is  stating 
is  that  all  empirical  consciousness  (so  far  as  it  is  conscious- 
ness of  objects)1  has  a  necessary  relation  to  a  transcendental 
consciousness  which  is  independent  of  any  particular  experience. 
This  transcendental  consciousness  is  original  apperception,  the 
consciousness  of  self  as  thinking. 

The  absolutely  first  principle  of  all  our  thinking2 — and  it 
is  a  synthetic  principle — is  this :  that  all  our  varied  empirical 
consciousness  must  be  combined  in  one  single  self-consciousness? 

Empirical  consciousness  is  varied  in  the  sense  that  it  is 
composed  of  one  idea  after  another,  but  I  must  be  able  to 
think  all  my  successive  ideas  as  my  ideas,  and  this  thinking 
must  be  one  synthetic  and  potentially  self-conscious  act. 
Apart  from  such  thinking  I  could  not  be  aware  of  the  succession 
of  my  ideas,  nor  could  I  be  aware  that  they  were  ideas  of 
one  objective  world.  It  is  absolutely  necessary  that  in  my 
knowledge  all  consciousness  should  belong  to  one  consciousness 
(of  myself).4 

In  this  place  again  Kant  identifies  the  unity  of  consciousness 
in  its  relation  to  the  manifold  with  the  unity  of  the  manifold 
in  consciousness.6  As  so  often,  the  necessary  synthetic  unity 

1  The  parenthesis  I  have  introduced  because  it  is  implied  by  several 
phrases  in  the  main  text,  and  by  the  next  sentence  in  the  footnote 
'in  my  knowledge  all  consciousness  must  belong  to  one  consciousness*. 

2  This  is  described  as  'thinking  in  general',  which  shows  that  it 
covers  all  thinking,  whether  analytic  or  synthetic.  Compare  B  131  n. 

3  Kant  seems  to  regard  this  as  another  way  of  stating  the  principle 
of  'the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  all  our  ideas'. 
See  §  3  above. 

4  *  Consciousness  of  myself  is  not  consciousness  of  myself  as  an 
empirical  individual,  but  of  myself  'as  original  apperception*.  Kant's 
language  may  suggest  that  he  is  stating  the  conditions  of  my  experience, 
but  I  think  he  is  attempting  to  state  the  conditions  of  experience  as 
such.  The  self-consciousness  of  which  he  speaks  is  consciousness  of 
the  nature  of  thinking  as  it  must  be  in  any  and  every  experience. 

5  When  he  says  'Here  then  is  a  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold 
(of  consciousness)',  'of  consciousness'  goes,  I  think,  with  unity,  not 
with  manifold. 


462        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXV  §  5 

of  consciousness  and  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the 
manifold  are  treated  as  the  same  thing. 

§  5.  Principles  of  the  Understanding 

This  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  is  known 
a  priori,  and  is  the  source  or  ground  of  synthetic  a  'priori 
propositions.1  These  propositions  are  the  'Principles  of  Pure 
Understanding',  such  as  the  principle  that  every  event  must 
have  a  cause.  They  concern  pure  thought,  for  they  tell  us 
what  pure  thinking  can  affirm  a  priori  in  regard  to  all  objects 
of  experience.2 

Hence  this  necessary  synthetic  unity — which  may  perhaps 
best  be  described  as  the  unity  of  apperception,  although  it  is, 
or  involves,  also  the  unity  of  the  manifold — is  for  thought 
what  space  and  time  are  for  intuition.  The  unity  of  apperception 
may  be  called  the  ultimate  form  of  thought,  as  space  and  time 
are  the  ultimate  forms  of  intuition.  It  gives  rise  to  synthetic 
a  priori  propositions  which  concern  the  pure  thought  involved 
in  experience,  just  as  space  and  time  give  rise  to  synthetic 
a  priori  propositions  which  concern  the  pure  intuitions3 
involved  in  experience.4 

1  For  this  reason  the  principle  of  necessary  synthetic  unity  is  a 
transcendental  principle. 

2  This  is  the  task  of  Transcendental  Logic,  which  contains  only  the 
rules  of  the  pure  thought  of  an  object.  See  A  55  =  B  80.  The  Principles 
can  be  derived  from  pure  thought,  only  because  a  manifold  of  pure 
intuitions  conditions  all  our  intuitions  of  objects. 

8  Kant  says  'which  refer  to  the  form  of  mere  intuition*.  I  do  not 
believe  that  'blossen  Anschauung'  can  mean  'pure  intuition',  as  Kemp 
Smith  translates  it :  it  must  mean  intuition  in  abstraction  from  thought. 
Kant,  as  usual,  is  careless  about  exact  parallelism.  Pure  thought 
should  be  parallel  to  pure  intuition,  and  the  form  of  thought  to  the 
form  of  intuition,  but  here  pure  thought  is  made  parallel  to  the  form 
of  intuition. 

4  I  take  the  one  set  of  synthetic  a  priori  propositions  to  be  those 
established  by  Transcendental  Logic,  and  the  other  set  to  be  those 
established  by  the  Transcendental  Aesthetic,  though  it  is  possible 
that  the  latter  set  includes  all  mathematical  propositions.  It  is  a 
matter  of  indifference  whether  we  say  that  these  propositions  concern 
the  pure  thought  and  the  pure  intuition  involved  in  experience,  or 


XXV  §  6]        THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  463 

§  6.  Clear  and  Obscure  Ideas 

Pure  apperception,  or  transcendental  consciousness,  is 
identified  with  self-conscious  thinking,  or  with  the  *I  think' 
which  is  implicit  in  all  our  judgements.  It  is  even  identified 
with  the  mere  idea  T;  but  the  idea  T  is  the  idea  of  the  self 
.as  thinking,  the  idea  of  the  self  'in  relation  to  all  other  ideas'. 
This  idea  is  said  to  make  possible  the  collective  unity  of  all 
other  ideas;  it  is  the  transcendental  consciousness  in  which 
they  are  all  necessarily  combined. 

Kant  again  points  out  that  this  idea  may  be  *  clear';  that  is, 
it  may  be  separated  out  from  our  other  ideas,  and  brought 
explicitly  before  our  empirical  consciousness.  At  other  times 
it  may  be  'obscure';  that  is,  it  may  not  be  explicitly  before 
empirical  consciousness.1  It  does  not  matter  whether  empirical 
consciousness2  that  I  am  thinking  is  or  is  not  present ;  I  do  not 
at  every  moment  direct  my  attention  to  the  fact  that  I  am 
thinking,  and  Kant  is  not  suggesting  that  I  always  do  direct 
my  attention  to  this  fact.  Nevertheless  the  fact  is  that  I  am 
always  thinking,  and  must  always  be  thinking,  whenever  I  have 
knowledge  of  an  object.  All  knowledge  has  a  logical  form 
imposed  by  thought,  just  as  it  has  an  intuitional  form 
imposed  by  our  sensibility;  and  the  possibility  of  this  logical 
form  depends  on  the  relation  of  knowledge  to  apperception 
as  a  faculty? 

All  our  experience  and  all  our  knowledge  is  based  upon 
the  presupposition  that  our  thought  is  a  unity.  We  need  not 
be  immediately  aware  of  this,  but  we  are  mediately  aware  of 
it,  if  it  is  implied  in  all  our  knowledge.  To  make  this  awareness 
explicit  to  any  degree  is  so  far  to  become  self-conscious. 

whether  we  say  that  they  concern  the  form  of  thought  and  the  form 
of  intuition  involved  in  experience. 

1  See  Chapter  XIX  §  8. 

2  Note  that  it  is  the  reality  of  the  empirical  consciousness — as 
is  shown  by  the  gender  of  the  word  'desselben* — and  not  the  reality 
of  the  idea,  which  Kant  asserts  to  be  a  matter  of  indifference.  Kemp 
Smith's  translation  fails  to  make  this  clear. 

8  I  should  prefer  to  say  that  it  is  due  to  thinking  which  is 
potentially  self-conscious. 


464        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXV  §  7 

We  are  obviously  self-conscious  when  we  say  'I  think  that 
A  is  B',  but  self -consciousness  is  obscurely  present  even 
when  we  say  that  *  A  is  B' ;  for  to  say  this  is  to  assert  an  objective 
connexion,  and  an  objective  connexion  is  one  which  is  dis- 
tinguished (however  vaguely)  from  a  subjective  connexion  in 
our  minds. 

§  7.  The  Pure  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

Hitherto  we  have  been  concerned  with  the  transcendental 
unity  of  apperception.1  Kant  now  takes  a  step  forward,  and 
deals  with  the  synthesis  of  imagination. 

The  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold,  which  is  thought  in 
all  experience,  presupposes,  or  includes,2  a  synthesis;  and  this 
synthesis — which  is  ascribed  to  imagination — must  be  pure  or 
a  priori,  since  the  synthetic  unity  which  it  imposes  is  a  necessary 
unity. 

Such  a  pure  synthesis  must  be  a  productive3  synthesis; 
for  a  reproductive  synthesis  depends  upon  conditions  of  ex- 
perience.4 

With  this  doctrine  we  are  now  familiar.  The  manifold  is 
given  to  us  successively  in  sense;  and  apart  from  thought, 
which  goes  beyond  the  moment,  it  has  not  even  the  unity  of 
a  succession  of  ideas,  still  less  the  unity  of  an  ordered  and 
objective  world.  Thought,  however,  cannot  give  unity  to  the 

1  It  is  transcendental  because  it  is  a  ground  of  synthetic  a  priori 
propositions  (see  §  4  above)  and  the  ultimate  source  of  the  necessary 
synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  given  to  us  in  intuition  (see  §  3  above ; 
and  compare  A  107). 

2  A  1 1 8.  The  addition  of  the  word  includes*  suggests  the  difficulty 
of  marking  off  the  work  of  thought  from  that  of  imagination.  Com- 
pare A  1 08. 

3  A  productive  synthesis  is  one  which  is  independent  of  experience, 
and  is  concerned  with  time  and  space.  See  Anthr.  §  28  (VII  167). 
We  can,  I  think,  afford  to  ignore  the  fact  that  the  imagination  of  the 
artist  is  sometimes  described  as  productive — see  K.d.U.  §§  22  and  49 
(V  240  and  314);  and  also  that  imagination  is  described  as  productive 
and  empirical  in  apprehension  (as  opposed  to  reproduction) — see 
Lose  Blatter  B  12  (Reicke,  Vol.  I,  p.  114). 

4  This  has  already  been  discussed.  See  Chapter  XIX  §  3. 


XXV  §  7]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  465 

manifold  except  by  the  help  of  imagination.  We  cannot 
conceive  a  particular  set  of  intuitions  as  being  intuitions  of 
a  house,  unless  we  gather  them  together  in  imagination,  and 
so  synthetise  them  in  accordance  with  our  concept  of  'house'. 
This  is  true,  both  of  empirical  concepts  like  'house',  and  of 
mathematical  concepts  like  'triangle'.  In  every  case  the  concept 
'at  work  in  our  judgement  presupposes,  or  includes,  a  synthesis 
of  imagination.  Kant  is  here  insisting  that  the  same  principle 
holds  in  regard  to  the  concept  of  the  necessary  synthetic 
unity  of  all  intuitions,  a  concept  necessarily  involved  in  all 
•knowledge  and  in  all  experience.  Just  as  each  particular 
concept1  presupposes  a  special  kind  of  imaginative  synthesis 
and  a  special  kind  of  manifold  synthetised,  so  the  unity  of 
apperception  presupposes  a  universal  synthesis2  of  every  given 
manifold  by  imagination;  and  this  synthesis  must  be  a  pure 
synthesis,  if  it  is  to  impose  a  necessary  unity. 

This  is  what  Kant  means  when  he  says  that  the  transcendental 
unity  of  apperception  is  related  to  the  pure  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion as  an  a  priori  condition  of  the  possibility  of  all  combination3 
of  the  manifold  in  one  knowledge.4 

Hence  we  have  a  second5  transcendental  principle,  which 
is  a  condition  of  the  possibility  of  all  knowledge  and  all 
experience.  This  principle  is  the  principle  of  the  necessary 
unity  of  the  pure  (productive)  synthesis  of  imagination.6 


1  I  use  'particular'  concepts  to  cover  empirical  and  mathematical 
concepts ;  they  are  opposed  to  strictly  universal  concepts  or  categories, 
and  apply  to  some  objects  but  not  to  all.  Compare  Chapter  XV  §  i. 

2  This  universal  synthesis  has  different  aspects,  which  are  thought 
in  the  separate  categories. 

3  It  is  so  because  every  empirical  synthesis  is  at  the  same  time  a 
pure  synthesis;  perhaps  also  because  all  empirical  association  pre- 
supposes the  transcendental  affinity  which  is  imposed  by  the  pure 
synthesis. 

4  Pure  thought  cannot  by  itself  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects 
apart  from  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

6  For  the  first  see  §  3  above. 

6  This  is  said  to  be  *  prior  to  apperception*.  This  phrase  illustrates 
the  way  in  which  Kant  is  prepared  to  call  any  necessary  factor  in 
a  whole  *  prior*  to  any  other  necessary  factor  in  that  whole. 


466       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXV  §  8 

Here,  as  usual,  the  synthesis  which  produces  unity  must 
itself  possess  unity.1 

§  8.  Pure  Synthesis  and  Experience 

There  may  seem  to  be  a  difficulty  in  the  fact  that  a  pure 
synthesis  of  the  imagination  must  work  with  a  pure  manifold,1 
whereas  we  have  here  a  pure  synthesis  whose  unity  is  the 
condition  of  experience.  How  can  a  pure  synthesis  determine 
the  empirical  manifold  given  to  sense  ?2 

It  should  be  unnecessary  at  this  stage  to  point  out  that  it 
does  so  because  space  and  time  are,  not  only  pure  intuitions 
containing  a  pure  manifold,  but  also  the  forms  of  all  empirical 
intuition.3  The  pure  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  time  and 
space4  conditions  and  determines  every  empirical  synthesis  of 
the  manifold  given  in  time  and  space.5  This  is  the  doctrine 
of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction,  and  has  been  elaborated  in 
the  provisional  exposition  in  order  to  avoid  excessive  diffuseness 
here.6  It  will  be  re-emphasised  again  and  again  in  the  chapters 
on  Schematism  and  the  Principles  of  the  Understanding. 
The  empirical  manifold  must  conform  to  the  synthetic  unity 
imposed  by  imagination  on  the  pure  manifold  of  time  and 
space;  and  therefore  it  must  conform  to  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception and  to  the  categories.7 

1  It  is  possible  that  Kant  again  identifies  the  unity  of  the  synthesis 
with  the  unity  produced  by  the  synthesis,  and  as  usual  we  must 
ask  ourselves  whether  on  Copernican  principles  such  an  identification 
is  justifiable. 

2  This  is  implied,  if  it  is  a  condition  of  experience,  and  a  condition 
of  all  combination  of  the  manifold  in  one  knowledge. 

8  Kant  points  this  out  clearly  in  B  150-1. 

4  The  pure  synthesis  is  in  accordance  with  the  categories,  and 
imposes  the  categories  on  the  manifold. 

6  The  empirical  synthesis  is  in  accordance  with  empirical  concepts. 
e  See  A  98,  and  compare  also  A  115-16. 

7  If  we  are  to  combine  the  manifold  in  one  time  and  space,  we  must, 
for  example,  combine  the  given  appearances  (of  such  an  object  as 
a  house)  as  accidents  of  a  permanent  substance. 


XXV  §  9]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  467 

§  9.  The  Transcendental  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

There  are  various  kinds  of  pure  synthesis,  and  these  have 
different  kinds  of  unity.  Thus  the  synthesis  by  which  the 
mathematician  constructs  a  triangle  in  pure  intuition  is  a  pure 
synthesis,  and  its  unity  depends  on  the  particular  concept  of 
'triangle*.1  Among  all  these  pure  syntheses  we  must  distinguish 
the  pure  synthesis  which  is  transcendental,  and  has  a  trans- 
cendental unity. 

A  synthesis  is  transcendental  when,  without  regard  to  the 
differences  in  intuitions,  it  is  directed  to  the  a  priori  combination 
of  the  manifold.2 

In  other  words,  a  transcendental  synthesis  is  not  directed 
to  produce  a  particular  kind  of  unity,  dependent  upon  the 
special  differences  of  the  given  intuitions.3  It  aims  at  producing 
that  unity,4  or  a  priori  combination,  which  is  necessary  for 
any  object  to  be  an  object,  whatever  be  the  character  of  the 
empirical  intuitions  through  which  it  is  shown. 

The  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  does  not  make 
one  object  a  house  and  another  a  ship.5  For  these  differences 
we  depend  on  differences  in  intuition.  It  does  make  every 
object  (whether  it  be  a  house  or  a  ship)  a  substance  with  acci- 
dents, an  extensive  quantity,  and  so  on.  These  are  necessary 
forms  of  unity,  or  of  combination,  which  must  belong  to 
everything  that  is  known  as  an  object  in  a  common  space  and 
time. 

1  Compare  A  78  =  B  104.  A  synthesis  is  pure  which  synthetises 
a  pure  manifold  (A  77  =  B  103),  and  rests  upon  a  ground  of  synthetic 
unity  a  priori  (A  78  =  B  104). 

2  A   1 1 8.   Compare  A   123  where  the  transcendental  function  of 
imagination  is  said  to  aim  only  at  'necessary  unity*  in  the  synthesis 
of  the  manifold.  The  same  doctrine  is  found  in  B  151. 

8  The  pure  syntheses  of  mathematics  produce  only  a  particular 
kind  of  unity,  for  example,  the  unity  which  belongs  to  triangles 
qua  triangles. 

4  Such  a  unity  is  the  counterpart  or  correlate  of  the  unity  of 
apperception. 

5  Compare  Chapter  VI  §  8. 


468       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXV  §  10 

§  10.  The  Transcendental  Unity  of  the  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

We  should  expect  Kant  to  add  that  this  synthesis  of  the 
imagination  is  transcendental  because  it  is  the  necessary 
condition  of  all  experience.  We  should  also  expect  him  to  say 
that  the  necessary  forms  of  combination  imposed  upon  the 
given  manifold  by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  space  and 
time  correspond  to  the  forms  of  synthesis  necessarily  involved 
in  the  unity  of  apperception;  or  in  other  words  that  they 
correspond  to  the  forms  of  judgement,  and  so  to  the  pure 
categories. 

This  is  what  he  goes  on  to  say,  but  for  some  reason  he 
chooses  to  say  it,  not  simply  about  the  transcendental  synthesis, 
but  about  the  transcendental  unity  of  the  transcendental 
synthesis.  I  cannot  see  that  he  gains  anything  by  this  compli- 
cation,1 and  his  statement  is  not  so  clear  as  one  could 
wish. 

'The  unity  of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
is  called  transcendental,  when  it  is  represented  as  necessary 
a  priori  in  relation  to  the  original  unity  of  apperception/2 

Kant's  doctrine  is  this :  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination  synthetises  all  the  manifold  given  in  time  and 
space  in  accordance  with  the  unity  of  apperception  and 
the  categories,  as  the  empirical  synthesis  of  imagination 
synthetises  the  given  manifold  in  accordance  with  empirical 
concepts.3 

The  transcendental  unity  of  the  synthesis  of  imagination  is 
thus  subordinate  to,  and  implied  in,  the  original  unity  of 
apperception.4  Since  the  latter  unity  is  transcendental,  as 

1  In  B  151  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  itself 
said  to  be  directed  to  the  original  synthetic  unity  of  apperception, 
that  is,  to  the  transcendental  unity  which  is  thought  in  the  categories. 
This  is,  I  think,  a  clearer  and  simpler  statement  of  what  Kant  is 
saying  in  the  present  passage.  Compare  A  145  =  B  185,  which  is 
also  clear.  2  A  118. 

3  For  the  differences  between  these  two  syntheses  see  §  14  below. 

4  In  spite  of  being  'prior'  to  it.  The  fact  that  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception is,  as  always,  'original',  shows  that  a  unity  connected  with  it 
is  derivative. 


XXV  §  1 1]        THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  469 

being  the  condition  of  the  possibility  of  all  knowledge,  the 
former  unity  must  also  be  the  condition  of  knowledge,  and 
so  must  be  transcendental.  In  other  words,  the  transcendental 
unity  of  the  synthesis  of  imagination  is  the  pure  form,  or 
condition,1  of  all  possible  experience,  whatever  be  the  matter 
given  to  sense. 

For  us,  at  the  present  stage,  the  connexion  between  the 
categories  involved  in  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  forms 
of  necessary  combination  imposed  upon  the  manifold  by  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  space  and  time  is  something  which 
awaits  further  justification.2  If  such  a  connexion  were  estab- 
lished, we  could  obviously  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  all 
objects  of  possible  experience.3 

§11.  Apperception  and  the  Understanding 

All  that  Kant  has  now  to  do  is  to  show  that  the  categories 
are  necessarily  involved  in  the  unity  of  apperception,  and  give 
us  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects  because  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  a  synthesis  in  accordance  with  the 
categories.  This  he  does,  but  in  a  way  which  seems  unnecessarily 
elaborate.4  At  the  same  time  he  attempts  to  connect  appercep- 
tion with  understanding — a  connexion  which  has  awaited 
an  explanation  ever  since  this  difference  in  terminology 
was  introduced.  Even  now  his  explanation  gives  us  little 
help. 

1  As  we  have  seen  so  often,  a  'form'  of  knowledge  is  equivalent 
to  a  'condition'  of  knowledge. 

2  Perhaps  if  we  accepted  Kant's  view  of  the  forms  of  judgement, 
we  could  say  that  it  is  now  justified  in  principle,  and  awaits  justification 
only  in  detail. 

3  This  would  be  a  'formal'  knowledge — a  knowledge  of  the  form, 
but  not  of  the  matter.  See  A  129-30. 

4  When  Kant's  expressions  seem  unnecessarily  elaborate,  we  must 
always,  I  think,  ask  ourselves  whether  a  deeper  insight  into  his  meaning 
might  not  enable  us  to  understand  why  he  expresses  himself  in  this 
elaborate  way.  On  the  other  hand  we  cannot  ignore  the  possibility 
that    his    expression    is    unnecessarily    elaborate,    because    he    has 
failed    to    see    the   shortest  way   to  his  goal.    See  M.A.d.N.    Vor.

470      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXV  §11 

'  The  unity  of  apperception  in  relation  to  the  synthesis  of  the 
imagination  is  the  understanding'1 

The  unity  of  apperception  is  in  relation  to2  the  synthesis  of 
imagination,  so  far  as  the  synthesis  is  in  accordance  with  a 
concept;  for  there  can  be  no  concept  apart  from  the  unity 
of  apperception,  and  every  concept3  contains  a  rule  for  the 
imagination. 

By  'understanding'  I  take  Kant  to  mean  understanding  as 
a  faculty  of  knowledge,  and  not  merely  a  faculty  of  thought.4 
Understanding,  as  a  faculty  of  knowledge,  is  made  possible 
because  the  faculty  of  thought  is  brought  into  relation  with 
imagination  and  sense.5  We  know  an  object,  when  by  means 
of  any  concept  we  conceive,  in  one  act  of  thought,  the  manifold 
as  synthetised  by  imagination  in  accordance  with  that  concept. 
This  is  the  work  of  understanding,  and  such  work  is  impossible 
apart  from  the  unity  of  apperception. 

'The  same  unity  of  apperception,  in  relation  to  the  trans- 
cendental synthesis  of  imagination,  is  pure  understanding* 

The  unity  of  apperception,  as  we  have  seen,6  is  in  relation 
to  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  because  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  synthetises  all  the 
manifold  given  in  time  and  space  in  accordance  with  the  unity 
of  apperception.7 

We  know  objects  a  priori,  when,  in  one  act  of  thought,  we 
conceive  the  manifold  as  necessarily  combined  by  the  trans- 
cendental synthesis  of  imagination8  in  accordance  with  the 
unity  of  apperception.  The  concepts9  by  which  we  thus  know 

1  A  119.  Compare  B  134  n.  I  do  not  know  why  Kant  identifies 
understanding  with  the  unity  of  apperception,  rather  than  with  apper- 
ception itself.  In  A  127  he  says  that  the  unity  of  apperception  is  the 
rule,  and  the  faculty  of  these  rules  is  understanding. 

2  *in  relation  to'  is  unnecessarily  vague. 

8  Compare  A  106.  Highly  abstract  concepts  like  Virtue*  and  so  on 
would  require  a  special  treatment  in  a  full  system  of  philosophy. 
4  A  97.  6  A  97-8.  6  §§  7  and  10  above. 

7  And  in  accordance  with  the  categories  which  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception involves. 

8  That  is,  combined  in  one  common  space  and  time. 

9  These  concepts  are  of  course  the  categories. 


XXV  §  iz]        THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  471 

objects  a  priori  are  necessarily  involved  in  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception itself.  Hence  pure  understanding,  as  possessing  in  itself 
such  concepts  of  objects  in  general,  is  to  be  identified  with 
the  unity  of  apperception ;  and,  in  relation  to  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination,  it  is  a  faculty  of  a  priori  knowledge.1 

• 
'§12.  Understanding  and  the  Categories 

The  understanding  therefore  (so  far  as  it  is  identified  with 
the  unity  of  apperception  in  relation  to  the  transcendental 
^synthesis  of  imagination)  contains  in  itself  pure  a  priori  cog- 
nitions. These  cognitions  are  cognitions  of  the  necessary  unity 
of  the  pure  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,2  which 
combines  all  possible  appearances  in  one  time  and  space. 
As  we  know,  such  cognitions  are  the  categories,  or  the  pure 
concepts  of  the  understanding,3  in  accordance  with  which  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  performed.4 

It  follows  that  the  empirical  power  of  human  knowledge 
necessarily  contains5  an  understanding  which  is  related  to  all 
objects  of  sense.  This  relation  is  a  mediate  relation,  not  an 
immediate  one,  for  understanding  is  always  related  to  its  objects 
by  means  of  intuition  and  the  synthesis  of  intuition  through 
imagination.6 

1  Apart  from  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  pure  under- 
standing is  not  a  faculty  of  a  priori  knowledge.  I  do  not,  however, 
like  the  identification  of  a  faculty  with  the  unity  of  apperception, 
although  this  is  perhaps  repeated  in  B  134  n. 

2  And  consequently  of  the  necessary  unity  imposed  on  the  manifold 
by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

3  Here  also  we  might  expect  Kant  to  refer  to  the  connexion  between 
the  categories  and  the  forms  of  judgement,  but  he  has  no  consideration 
for  the  weaknesses  of  human  nature,  and  is  satisfied  to  have  shown 
this  connexion  in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction. 

4  It  is  because  the  transcendental  synthesis  is  performed  in  accor- 
dance with  the  categories  that  the  categories  (or  the  pure  a  priori 
cognitions  of  the  understanding)  are  said  to  contain  the  necessary 
unity  of  the  pure  synthesis. 

6  Compare  A  124-5,  where  Kant  insists  that  experience  in  empirical 
recognition  (or  understanding)  'contains*  concepts  which  make  possible 
the  formal  unity  of  experience. 

6  Compare  A  19  =  B  33  and  A  67-9  =  B  92-4. 


472      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXV  §  13 

Kant  is  insisting,  though  not  too  clearly,  that  empirical 
understanding  is  conditioned  by  pure  understanding,1  and  that 
every  judgement,  whatever  empirical  concepts  it  uses,  must 
apply  the  categories  to  objects  given  in  intuition. 

§  13.  Understanding  and  Appearances 

When  Kant  says  that  understanding  is  related  to  all  objects 
of  sense,  he  means  that  understanding  and  objects  stand  in  a 
necessary  relation  to  one  another.  This  necessary  relation  can 
be  looked  at  from  two  sides. 

From  the  side  of  understanding  Kant  means  that  the  under- 
standing in  itself  contains  pure  concepts  or  categories,  by 
which  it  has  a  priori  knowledge  of  sensible  objects.  From  the 
side  of  the  objects  he  means  that  all  the  given  matter  of  sense 
must  conform  to  the  categories,  if  it  is  to  be  an  element  in 
experience. 

Kant's  whole  argument  turns  on  the  possibility  of  experience,2 
experience  being  always  a  compound  of  intuition  and  thought. 
Unless  given  intuitions  or  appearances  can  be  thought,  they 
cannot  be  for  us  intuitions  of  objects,  and  so  cannot  give  us 
knowledge  or  experience.  But  if  they  are  to  be  thought  or 
judged,  they  must  conform  to  the  conditions  or  forms  of 
judgement,  and  therefore  to  the  categories.  Apart  from  the 
categories  there  can  be  no  experience  of  objects. 

Pure  understanding  is  therefore,  by  means  of  the  categories 
which  it  contains  in  itself  independently  of  any  given  matter, 
a  formal  and  synthetic  principle  of  all  appearances.  Appearances, 
if  they  are  to  be  given,  must  conform  to  space  and  time  as 
forms  of  intuition.  If  they  are  to  be  appearances  of  objects, 
they  must  conform  to  the  categories  as  forms  of  thought, 

1  The  unity  of  apperception,  when  it  is  related  to  an  empirical 
synthesis  of  imagination,  is  always  related  to  a  pure  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  as  well.  Obviously  when  we  construct  a 
house  in  imagination,  starting  from  a  given  sensum,  we  construct 
time  and  space  also. 

2  This  was  made  clear  even  in  A  93-4  =  B  126,  and  it  dominates 
the  whole  of  the  Analytic. 


XXV  §  i4]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  473 

or  as  formal  principles  of  synthesis  contained  in  the  nature  of 
understanding  itself.1 

This  is  the  essence  of  the  Objective  Deduction,  while  the 
doctrine  that  there  must  be  a  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination  in  accordance  with  the  categories  is  the  essence 

of  th$  Subjective  Deduction. 

• 

§  14.  Understanding  and  Imagination 

It  may  help  to  clarify  Kant's  doctrine,  if  we  review  the 
different  ways  in  which  the  work  of  understanding  or  thought 
is  related  to  the  synthesis  of  imagination. 

In  an  empirical  concept2  thought  conceives  the  rule  of  the 
empirical  synthesis  of  imagination  whereby  the  given  manifold 
is  combined  into  an  object  such  as  a  house ;  and  this  synthesis 
is  partly  determined  by  the  intuitions  which  are  given,  and 
partly  determined  by  the  ultimate  principles  of  synthesis 
which  belong  to  the  mind  itself. 

In  a  mathematical  concept  thought  conceives  the  rule  of 
the  pure  synthesis  of  imagination  whereby  the  pure  manifold 
of  space  is  'arbitrarily'  combined  into  such  an  object  as  a 
triangle.  In  this  case  the  synthesis  is  not  determined  by  given 
empirical  intuitions,  though  it  must  be  consistent  with  the  pure 
intuition  of  space,3  and  must  also  be  consistent  with  the 
ultimate  principles  of  synthesis  which  belong  to  the  mind 
itself.4  The  character  of  the  synthesis  is,  however,  primarily 
due  to  a  choice  of  the  mind,  which  'arbitrarily'  constructs 
a  figure  in  accordance  with  its  concept  of  'triangle',  and  not  one 
in  accordance  withjts  concept  of  'circle'. 

1  Compare  B  164. 

2  For  the  differences  in  concepts  see  Chapter  IX  §  5. 

8  For  example,  we  cannot  construct  a  figure  enclosing  space  by 
means  of  two  straight  lines. 

4  Some  qualifications  are  necessary  for  this  statement,  since  a 
mathematical  triangle  is  only  the  form  of  an  object  and  not  strictly 
speaking  an  object  itself  (see  B  147).  Perhaps  we  could  say  that  not 
all  the  ultimate  principles  of  synthesis  are  at  work  unless  there  is 
a  synthesis  of  the  given  empirical  manifold  as  well  as  a  synthesis  of 
the  pure  homogeneous  manifold  of  space.  A  mathematical  triangle 
has  quantity,  but  only  a  real  triangle  is  a  substance. 


474       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXV  §  14 

In  pure  concepts  of  the  understanding1  thought  conceives 
the  rule  of  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  whereby 
the  pure  manifold  is  combined  into  one  time  and  space  possess- 
ing a  necessary  synthetic  unity  in  accordance  with  which  all 
empirical  manifolds  must  be  combined.2  Here  the  relation 
between  the  pure  concept  of  the  understanding  antf  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  akin  to  the  relation 
between  the  mathematical  concept  and  the  pure  synthesis 
whereby  a  mathematical  figure  is  constructed:  the  concept  is 
the  main  factor  in  determining  the  synthesis.  The  difference 
between  the  two  cases  is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that  while 
the  mathematical  concept  is  arbitrary,  the  pure  concept  is 
necessarily  involved  in  the  nature  of  thought  itself.3 

If  we  ignore  the  differences  between  the  categories — as 
Kant  for  the  most  part  does  himself  in  the  Transcendental 
Deduction — thought  as  such,  conception  as  such,  necessarily 
requires  synthetic  unity  in  its  object;  and  consequently  it 
requires  a  synthesis  of  imagination  which  has  a  rule  and  so 
is  capable  of  being  conceived  as  a  unity.4  If  we  had  only 
empirical  intuitions,  and  if  empirical  intuitions  were  things- 
in-themselves,  this  requirement  of  thought  might  not  be  met 
by  reality.  But  since  time  and  space  consist  of  a  pure  homo- 
geneous manifold,  the  imagination  must  be  able  to  perform 

1  I  ignore  complications  is  regard  to  the  difference  between  pure 
and  schematised  categories.  These  have  already  been  indicated  in 
Chapter  XIII  §  6,  and  will  be  explained  more  fully  in  the  sequel; 
see  Chapter  XXXIII. 

2  To  combine  an  empirical  manifold  into  an  object  is  to  determine 
its  place  in  one  common  space  and  time.  We  shall  see  later  that  to 
determine  the  relation  of  spaces  and  times  to  one  another  requires 
in  turn  a  combination  of  the  empirical  manifold  in  these  spaces  and 
times. 

3  We  can  think  about  objects  without  using  mathematical  concepts, 
but  not  without  the  categories. 

4  Conception  as  such  requires  not  only  that  we  should  by  an  act 
of  analysis  grasp  the  common  characteristics  of  different  objects 
(whatever  these  may  be):  it  also  requires  that  we  should  be  able  to 
hold  together  by  one  act  of  synthesis   the  object   or  objects  which 
we  seek  to  analyse.  This  is  the  whole  burden  of  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction. 


XXV  §  i4]       THE  PROGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  475 

a  pure  transcendental  synthesis  which  satisfies  the  need  for 
unity;  and  since  time  and  space  are  also  forms  of  our  sensi- 
bility to  which  all  empirical  intuitions  must  conform,  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  must  be  able  to 
impose  necessary  synthetic  unity  on  the  empirical  manifold 
in  accordance  with  the  demands  of  thought. 

It  is  Kant's  belief  that  the  different  forms  of  judgement 
presuppose  different  principles  of  synthesis,  and  consequently 
different  kinds  of  synthetic  unity  in  the  manifold  judged ;  and 
it  is  also  his  belief  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion works  according  to  these  principles,  and  imposes  on  the 
manifold  the  different  kinds  of  necessary  synthetic  unity 
required.  The  correspondence  between  the  categories  as  prin- 
ciples of  synthesis  and  the  forms  of  judgement  '  leaps  to  the 
eye';1  but  Kant  has  yet  to  give  us  the  details  which  alone  can 
explain  the  alleged  correspondence  and  justify  his  belief  in 
regard  to  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.  The 
Transcendental  Deduction  establishes  only  the  general  possi- 
bility of  his  view.  The  details  are  reserved  for  the  Analytic  of 
Principles.  • 

This  doctrine,  so  far  as  I  can  see,  does  not  really  depend 
on  the  view  that  the  mind  has  separate  faculties  of  under- 
standing and  imagination.  Its  essence  is  to  be  found  in  the 
contention  that  one  and  the  same  mind  performs  two  different, 
but  related,  acts2— the  act  of  imaginative  synthesis  and  the 
act  of  conceiving  the  principle  at  work  in  the  imaginative 
synthesis.  It  is  easy  enough  to  see  that  the  second  act  may 
properly  be  described  as  an  act  of  self-consciousness  or 
apperception. 

1  Sec  B  m-i2. 

2  Or  two  different  aspects  of  what  is  essentially  one  act.  Certainly 
we  must  not  suppose  that  there  are  two  acts  such  that  one  precedes 
the  other  in  time. 


CHAPTER    XXVI 
THE    REGRESSIVE    EXPOSITION 

§  i.  The  Regressive  Exposition 

The  Transcendental  Deduction  has  now  been  completed, 
since  we  have  established  the  fact  that  appearances1  and  the 
understanding  are  necessarily  related,  or  connected,  by*  means 
of  the  categories. 

Our  proof,  however,  has  not  that  pellucid  character  which 
secures  easy  conviction,  and  Kant  proposes  to  make  this 
necessary  relation  or  connexion  still  more  clear,  to  lay  it  before 
our  very  eyes.  He  will  begin  with  the  lowest  element  in  experi- 
ence, sense-perception,  and  will  gradually  mount  up  to  the 
unity  of  apperception.2  In  this  way  we  shall  be  able  more 
easily  to  interpret  his  account  in  the  light  of  the  provisional 
exposition,  which  follows  the  same  order.  We  shall  also  be 
able  to  do  more  justice  to  the  empirical  elements  in  experience, 
which  have,  very  properly,  played  little  part  in  his  synthetic 
or  progressive  proof,  a  proof  concerned  primarily  with  the 
transcendental  use  of  imagination  and  apperception.3 

§  2.  Given  Appearances 

The  first  thing  that  is  given  to  us  is  appearance,  and  when 
this  is  combined  with  consciousness,  it  is  called  sense- 
perception.4 

1  That  is,  appearances  as  data  for  a  possible  experience.  See  A  119. 

2  It  should  be  unnecessary  to  repeat  the  warning  that  Kant  is 
offering   us   an   analysis  of  the   different  factors   and   elements   in 
experience,  not  an  account  of  the  way  in  which  experience  develops 
out  of  something  that  is  not  experience. 

3  Compare  A  94-5.  This  passage  also  explains,  I  think,  why  Kant 
says  so  little  about  time  and  space  in  the  authoritative  exposition — 
they  are  supposed  to  have  been  adequately  treated  in  the  Aesthetic. 

4  A  120,  '  Wahrnehmung*   or  '  perception  \   compare  A  320  =  B  376. 
Sense-perception  is  said  to  be  an  idea  accompanied  by  sensation 
(B  147) ;  and  again  to  be  empirical  consciousness,  that  is,  consciousness 
in  which  sensation  is  present  (B  207);  and  again  to  be  empirical 


XXVI  §  2]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  477 

Appearance  in  the  first  instance  would  seem  to  be  what  is 
to-day  called  a  sensum;  while  sense-perception  is  the  whole 
state  of  mind  of  which  the  sensum  is  the  content.1  Appearance 
is  also  used  in  a  much  wider  sense  by  Kant  to  cover  an  'image', 
such  as  the  image  of  a  house;2  and  he  seems  to  use  the  word 
'impression'3  (though  not  very  often)  for  what  we  call  a  sensum 
or  even  for  the  elements  into  which  a  sensum  can  be  analysed . 

Kant  does  not  believe  that  appearances  exist  apart  from 
consciousness.4  Nevertheless  they  are  not  made  by,  but  given 
to,  the  mind,  which  must  take  them  up  into  its  own  activity, 
if  we  are  to  be  conscious  of  them.  They  have  no  objective 
reality  in  themselves,  they  exist  only  in  knowledge,  and  apart 
from  the  mind  they  are  nothing  at  all.5 

Kant  puts  this  point  by  saying  that  appearances  must  be 
related  to  a  consciousness  which  is  at  least  possible.  Would  it 
not  be  simpler  to  say  that  they  exist  only  for  actual  conscious- 
ness? 

I  think  the  reason  for  Kant's  expression  is  this.  The 
appearance  given  to  us  at  any  moment  is  something  very 
poor  and  thin,  which  implies  other  appearances  beyond  itself. 
We  see  the  appearance  of  the  front  of  a  house,  but  we  think 

consciousness  of  intuition  as  appearance  (B  160).  See  also  A  115, 
where  sense  is  said  to  represent  appearances  empirically  in  sense- 
perception. 

1  Kant's  terminology  is  not  always  consistent,  and  *  sense-perception* 
is  sometimes  equivalent  to  Sensum'.  We  may  note  that  a  sense- 
perception  considered  in  relation  to  the  subject,  as  a  modification  of 
a  state  of  mind,  is  a  sensation  (Empfin dung) ;  considered  as  relating 
immediately  to  an  object  it  is  an  intuition  (Anschauung).  See  A  320 
=  B  376-7,  where,  oddly  enough,  an  objective  perception  is  equated 
with  'cognitio*  and  is  said  to  be  either  an  intuition  or  a  concept. 

2  Such  an  'image'  is  not  opposed  to  an  object:  It  may  be,  and  often 
is,  an  object — but  not  apart  from  thought. 

3  'Eindruck.'  For  this  terminology  see  Chapter  XIX  §  2,  especially 
footnote  on  page  362. 

4  He  believes,  like  Leibniz,  in  petites  perceptions  which  are  uncon- 
scious in  a  sense,  but  even  these  do  not  exist  apart  from  consciousness. 

6  Kant's  language  is  ambiguous,  but  I  do  not  think  he  can  here 
mean  merely  that  apart  from  the  mind  appearances  would  not  be 
appearances  of  objects. 


478      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVI  §  3 

that  the  sides  and  back  of  the  house  could  also  appear  to  us. 
None  of  these  appearances  has  any  reality  apart  from  human 
minds,  but  they  are  all  equally  real  for  human  minds.  We  can 
pass  by  means  of  the  Analogies,  and  especially  by  the  law  of 
cause  and  effect,  from  our  actual  sense-perception  to  other 
possible  sense-perceptions,  and  the  possible  sense-perceptions 
which  are  thus  connected  with  our  immediate  sense-perception 
are  also  real.  In  this  way  appearances  may  have  a  kind  of 
existence  as  related  to  a  possible  consciousness.1 

§3.  The  Synthesis  of  Apprehension 

Sensa  or  impressions  must  be  'taken  up'  into  the  activity  of 
the  imagination,  or  in  other  words  they  must  be  'apprehended'. 
Apprehension  is  an  act  which  is  exercised  immediately  or 
directly2  upon  such  sensa  or  impressions.3 

Apprehension  is  certainly  the  work  of  imagination,  but 
Kant  does  not  make  it  clear  whether  apprehension  is  an 
element  in  a  whole  synthesis  which  may  be  described  as  repro- 
ductive, or  whether  apprehension  is  the  whole  synthesis  in 
which  reproduction  is  an  element.  The  latter  interpretation 
seems  the  more  probable.4  In  any  case  there  is  only  one  syn- 
thesis of  imagination,  in  which  both  apprehension  and  repro- 
duction play  their  part,  and  the  name  by  which  we  describe 
this  synthesis  does  not  greatly  matter. 

What  is  given  to  us  by  sense  is  always  a  manifold,  but  it 
has  to  be  combined^  the  activity  of  imagination,  and  represented 

1  See  the  Second  Postulate,  A  225-6  =  B  272-4.  Sense-perception 
is  there  said  to  be  sensation  of  which  one  is  conscious,  but  a  thing 
may  be  actual,   though  it  is  not  immediately  perceived.   Compare 
A  493  =  B  521. 

2  A  120;  compare  A  99  and  Chapter  XIX  §  2. 

8  Kant  himself  says  *  sense-perceptions',  but  the  following  sentence 
shows  that  these  are  meant  to  be  equivalent  to  'sensa'  or  'impressions'. 
In  A  99  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  was  exercised  directly  upon 
'intuition'.  This  loose  use  of  language  makes  Kant  very  difficult, 
but  to  correct  his  terminology  would  be  an  almost  impossible  task, 
and  we  must  be  content  to  grasp  his  general  meaning.

XXVI  §  4]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  479 

as  a  manifold.  The  manifold  given  to  sense  has  no  unity  or 
combination  in  itself,  and  it  must  be  combined  into  a 
whole  which,  at  this  stage,  Kant  describes  as  a  picture  or 
image.1 

By  'image'  Kant  seems  to  mean,  not  something  simple,  like 
a  red  colour  (which,  I  take  it,  would  to-day  be  called  a  sensum), 
hut  something  more  elaborate,  like  the  image  of  a  house.2 

Kant's  contention  would  obviously  be  more  questionable,  if 
the  image  were  a  red  colour ;  though  the  fact  that  it  takes  some 
time  even  to  see  one  colour  might  be  urged  in  his  support, 
if  the  image  is  more  elaborate,  like  the  image  of  a  house,  the 
presence  of  an  imaginative  synthesis  seems  to  me  undeniable.3 

§  4.  The  Synthesis  of  Reproduction 

A  mere  'taking  up*  of  one  impression  or  sensum  after  another 
would  not  by  itself  produce  an  image  or  a  connexion4  of 
impressions.  For  this  reproduction  is  necessary.5  We  must 
therefore  have  a  reproductive  power  of  imagination  which  is 
able  to  reinstate  earlier  sense-perceptions  beside  later  ones,  and 

1  Compare  A  99.   There  is  a  play  upon  'Bild*  (an  image)  and 
' EinbildungskrafC  (imagination). 

2  Compare  'images  of  objects'  in  A  120  n.  When  Kant  says  that 
every  'appearance'  contains  a  manifold,  and  therefore  different  'sense- 
perceptions'  occur  in  the  mind  in  isolation,  it  looks  as  if  'appearance* 
were  not  a  mere  sensum,  but  an  appearance  such  as  a  house,  which 
is  its  commoner  meaning.  It  also  looks  as  if  the  'sense-perceptions' 
were  sensa  or  impressions  (or  states  of  mind  containing  only  sensa 
or  impressions). 

3  In  a  note  Kant  adds  that  imagination  is  an  ingredient  in  sense- 
perception  (in  spite  of  the  fact  that  it  is  exercised  on  sense-perception) ; 
but  sense-perception  here  involves  awareness  of  an  image,  such  as 
that  of  a  house.  Compare  B  162  where  he  says  that  the  empirical 
intuition  of  a  house  is  made  into  a  sense-perception  by  apprehension. 

4  ' Zusammenhang.'  This  word  suggests  that  an  'image'  is  something 
more  than  a  simple  colour. 

5  Compare  A  102.  Curiously  enough,  Kant  does  not  here  use  the 
phrase  'synthesis  of  apprehension'  or  'synthesis  of  reproduction'; 
but  in  A  120  he  speaks  of  imagination  as  a  'power  of  synthesis' 
(compare  also  A  120  n.),  and  the  doctrine  is  the  same  as  that  of  the 
provisional  exposition. 


480      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXVI  §  4 

so  to  exhibit  a  whole  series  of  sense-perceptions.1  In  that  case 
the  reproductive  power  of  imagination  is  said  to  be  empirical. 

It  is  obvious  that  this  reproductive  power  of  imagination 
works  by  rule,2  and  indeed  that  it  must  do  so,  if  it  can  help 
us  to  know  objects.  We  do  not  reproduce  past  ideas  at  random, 
but  any  given  idea  recalls  certain  other  ideas  by  rules,  for 
example  by  contiguity  or  similarity.  These  rules  are  subjective, 
they  belong  to  the  nature  of  the  mind,  although  they  would 
not  be  possible  unless  given  ideas  were  contiguous  and  similar. 
The  subjective  and  empirical  ground  of  reproduction  in  accor- 
dance with  such  rules  is  therefore  called  the  association  of 
ideas? 

Unfortunately  Kant  does  not  state  what  the  laws  of  associa- 
tion are,  nor  does  he  give  us  examples  of  what  he  means.4 
All  the  laws  of  association  no  doubt  help  our  thinking  (though 
they  sometimes  also  disturb  it).  The  law  of  contiguity,  for 
example,  helps  us  to  think  of  causes  and  effects,  and  this  is 
one  of  the  laws  that  Kant  probably  has  in  mind.5  I  cannot 
help  suspecting  that  he  has  in  mind  also,  and  perhaps  even 
primarily,  the  law  of  reproduction  by  affinity,6  the  outstanding 


1  I  say  'sense-perceptions'  rather  than  'impressions',  because  Kant 
does  so,  but  I  doubt  whether  there  is  any  real  distinction  intended 
here  (unless  Kant  means  that  the  whole  state  of  consciousness  is 
reproduced). 

2  Kant  says  'by  a  rule',  yet  there  are  several  rules  or  laws  of  associa- 
tion, and  in  the  next  sentence  he  himself  speaks  of  'rules'. 

3  The  association  of  ideas  is  usually  the  name  given  to  the  laws 
governing  reproduction,  but  here  it  seems  to  be  used  for  the  natural 
tendency  of  the  mind  which  is  described  in  these  laws. 

4  The  examples  given  in  A  102  are  all  too  special,  because  they 
are  concerned  with  a  pure  synthesis. 

6  See  Anthr.  §  31  B  (VII  176)  and  compare  Chapter  XIX  §  4. 

6  See  Anthr.  §  31  C  (VII 176)  and  compare  Chapter  XIX  §  5.  Affinity 
is  itself  the  objective  ground  of  association,  but  our  tendency  to 
associate  ideas  because  of  their  affinity  is  subjective  and  empirical. 
It  should,  however,  be  noted  that  when  we  speak  of  association  by 
affinity,  'affinity'  is  used  in  a  narrower  sense ;  for  it  refers  to  association 
because  of  the  coherence  of  qualities  in  one  object,  whereas  affinity 
as  the  objective  ground  of  association  is  presumably  the  objective 
ground  of  all  association. 


XXVI  §  5]        THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  481 

example  of  which  is  to  be  found  when  we  associate  ideas 
because  they  are  all  ideas  of  the  same  object.  In  any  case  he 
is,  I  think,  certainly  concerned  with  something  more  than 
a  simple  image  like  the  colour  red. 

§5.  Transcendental  Affinity 

For  purposes  of  reproduction  we  require  not  only  a  subjective 
ground,  or  a  natural  tendency  in  the  mind;  we  require  also  an 
objective  ground,  or  a  ground  in  the  object.1  This  objective 
ground  is  called  the  'affinity'  of  appearances.2 

It  is  obvious  enough  that  there  must  be  some  regularity  or 
repetition  in  the  succession  of  given  impressions,  if  there  is 
to  be  any  association  by  contiguity.3  It  is  also  obvious  that  if 
there  is  to  be  association  by  affinity  (that  is,  because  ideas  are 
derived  from  a  common  ground,  and  more  especially  from 
a  common  object),  then  there  must  be  some  coherence  and 
consistency  in  the  given  qualities  of  objects.4  Without  such 
regularity  and  coherence  our  power  of  association  could  never 
be  exercised,5  and  apart  from  the  exercise  of  this  power  there 
could  certainly  never  be  knowledge.  We  could  never  even  be 
aware  of  the  succession  of  sense-impressions,  for  such  awareness 
itself  is  impossible  apart  from  reproduction  and  recognition 
(or  memory). 

From  the  fact  that  our  ideas  are  associated  in  accordance 


*A  121. 

2  A  122.  Compare  also  A  113  where  affinity  is  said  to  be  the  ground 
of  the  possibility  of  association,  so  far  as  it  lies  in  the  object. 

3  This  is  the  work  of  associative  imagination,  which  connects  ideas 
in  time.  See  Chapter  XIX  §  4. 

4  Compare  the  example  of  cinnabar  in  A  100. 

5  Similarly  if  no  given  sensa  were  like  one  another,  there  could 
be  no  association  by  similarity.  In  this  Kant  seems  to  be  less  interested, 
but  there  must  be  similarity  in  objects,  if  there  are  repetitions  in  the 
successions  of  given  impressions.  I  feel  some  doubt  whether  trans- 
cendental affinity  could,  even  on  Kant's  own  premises,  necessarily 
imply  constancy  in  objects  and  the  repetition  of  causal  sequences, 
and  the  same  doubt  applies  to  similarity  in  objects ;  see  Chapters  XXIV 
§  2  (at  the  end)  and  XIX  §  5. 

VOL.  I  Q 


48*       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVI  §  5 

with  certain  empirical  laws1  we  could  infer  only  that  there 
must  be  some  regularity  and  some  coherence  in  given  impres- 
sions.2 We  could  never  infer  that  this  regularity  and  coherence 
must  be  a  necessary  regularity  and  coherence.3 

Kant  believes  that  the  regularity  and  coherence  in  given 
impressions  is  universal  and  necessary.  It  is  no  accident  that 
appearances  are  given  in  such  a  way  as  to  fit  into  a  System, 
of  human  knowledge.  This  he  establishes,  not  by  arguing 
fallaciously  from  the  empirical  facts  of  association,  but  by 
arguing  from  the  unity  of  apperception,  which  is  the  ultimate 
condition  of  human  knowledge.4  The  unity  of  apperception  is 
impossible  apart  from  the  necessary  synthetic  unity  of 
appearances.5  This  necessary  synthetic  unity  of  appearances 
is  identical8  with  what  Kant  calls  their  transcendental  affinity  ;7 
and  he  assumes  that  it  implies  a  necessary  regularity  and 
coherence  manifested  in  repeated  causal  successions  and  in  the 
relative  constancy  of  objects. 

If  given  appearances  were  things-in-themselves,  or  even  if 
their  succession  were  due  to  real  changes  of  things-in-themselves 
in  a  real  time,  this  argument,  as  Kant  himself  recognises, 
would  be  quite  unjustifiable.8  The  argument  holds,  according 
to  him,  only  because  appearances  are  essentially  dependent 
upon  human  sensibility,  and  because  the  time  in  which  they 
succeed  one  another  is  a  form  under  which  human  beings  must 
intuit  reality. 

1  The  most  important  of  these   are   the   laws   of  association   by 
similarity,  by  contiguity,  and  by  affinity. 

2  The  inference  seems  hardly  necessary,  since  we  know  this  fact 
by  experience,  an  experience,  however,  which  would  be  impossible 
but  for  the  fact  of  association.  3  See  Chapter  XIX  §  5. 

4  In  the  provisional  exposition  Kant  argued  this  first  of  all  from 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  (A  101-2),  and  only 
later  from  the  unity  of  apperception.  See  especially  A  113. 

6  A  116-17.  Compare  A  105  and  A  106-7. 

6  The  necessary  synthetic  unity  involved  in  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception may  indeed  be  taken  in  abstraction  from  time,  but  when  it  is 
taken  as  realised  in  time,  then  it  is  identical  with  transcendental 
affinity.

is  the  condition  of  all  experience.  8  A  101  and  A  113-14. 


XXVI  §  6]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  483 

On  these  suppositions  the  affinity  of  appearances,  or  the 
objective  ground  which  makes  association  of  ideas  possible, 
rests  upon  the  principle  of  the  unity  of  apperception.  All 
appearances,  if  they  are  to  be  elements  in  my  knowledge, 
must  come  into  the  mind,  or  be  apprehended,  in  such  a  way 
that  they  agree  with  the  unity  of  apperception.  This  could 
not  happen  without  synthetic  unity  in  their  combination, 
which  is  therefore  objectively  necessary,  that  is,  necessary  if 
we  are.to  have  any  experience  of  objects.1 

Kant's  argument  is  difficult  enough  in  any  case,  but  if  we 
"approach  it  with  realist  presuppositions,  it  is  bound  to  seem 
absurd  and  even  nonsensical.2 

§  6.  The  Transcendental  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

All  empirical  consciousness,  if  it  is  to  be  consciousness  of 
objects,  must  be  united  in  one  transcendental  consciousness, 
that  is,  in  original  apperception.3  This  principle  is  the  necessary 
condition  of  all  possible  sense-perception  as  an  element  in 
experience. 

Kant's  argument  rests  upon  the  doctrine  that  unless  this 
were  so,  there  could  be  no  experience  of  objects,  no  knowledge, 
and  no  thought.  There  could  only  be  a  succession  of  unrelated 
sense-perceptions,  which  we  could  not  even  know  to  be  a 
succession. 

This  argument  he  proceeds  to  strengthen  by  an  account  of 
the  subjective  machinery  by  which  this  necessary  unity  is 
imposed  upon  sense-perceptions.4 

The  transcendental  affinity  of  all  appearances,  whatever  be 
their  position  in  our  common  space  and  time,  is,  Kant  main- 

1  A  122.  Because  there  can  be  no  experience  of  objects  apart  from 
the  unity  of  apperception. 

2  A  114.  3  See  A  123  and  A  117  n. 
4  With  this  we  pass  to  the  subjective  side  of  the  Deduction,  as  is 

necessary  to  complete  the  argument.  From  the  unity  of  apperception 
we  can  argue  that  if  we  are  to  have  knowledge  of  objects,  all  the 
manifold  must  conform  to  the  pure  categories ;  but  we  cannot  under- 
stand from  this  alone  why  the  conformity  of  the  manifold  should 
be  more  than  a  mere  accident. 


484       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVI  §  7 

tains,  a  necessary  consequence  of  a  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination.  This  is  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  space  and 
time,  which  is  grounded  a  priori  upon  rules,  that  is,  upon  the 
categories.1  The  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
imposes  upon  all  appearances,  not  only  extensive  quantity,  but 
also  necessary  regularity  and  coherence.2 

'Necessary  regularity  and  coherence',  or  'transcendental 
affinity',  may  perhaps  still  seem  terms  too  wide  to  be  clearly 
understood.  They  cover,  I  think,  all  the  necessary  Jaws  of 
appearances,  discussed  in  the  Principles,  and  especially  in  the 
Analogies.  For  the  sake  of  clearness,  we  may  take  one  particular 
example  from  the  law  of  cause  and  effect.  Kant  believes  that 
the  laying  of  a  heavy  ball  on  a  soft  cushion  will  always  be  fol- 
lowed by  a  depression  in  the  cushion  (other  circumstances 
being  unchanged);3  and  that  this  necessary  succession,  or 
causal  connexion,  is  due,  not  to  changes  in  things-in-themselves, 
but  to  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  which 
imposes  the  causal  law  upon  all  succession  of  appearances. 
The  transcendental  synthesis  does  not  make  the  depression 
the  effect  of  the  ball,  but  it  makes  every  event  the  effect  of 
some  cause,  and  the  cause  of  some  effect,  in  accordance  with 
a  rule.  Whether  we  like  it  or  not,  I  do  not  think  it  can  be 
doubted  that  this  is  what  his  doctrine  is. 

§  7.  Transcendental  Imagination  and  Experience 

Imagination  has,  on  this  view,  a  transcendental,  as  well  as 
an  empirical,  use.4  It  is  a  power  of  aprioriy  as  well  as  of  empirical, 
synthesis,  and  as  such  it  may  be  called  productive5  imagination. 

1  A  123;  compare  A  125. 

2  I  need  hardly  repeat  again  that  the  reason  why  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  can  (i)  be  grounded  upon  the  categories 
and  (2)  can  impose  categorial  principles  of  synthesis  upon  the  given 
manifold  is  that  it  is  a  synthesis  of  a  pure  manifold  given  in  the  nature 
of  our  sensibility  and  conditioning  all  empirical  sensation. 

8  A  203  =  B  248. 

4  A  94;  compare  Chapters  XVII  §  9  and  XI  §  4. 

5  A  123.  Note  that  the  word  'productive*  is  here  restricted  to 
imagination  manifested  in  an  a  priori  synthesis,  that  is,  in  a  synthesis 
independent  of  experience ;  compare  Chapter  XXV  §  7. 


XXVI  §  7]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  485 

Productive  imagination  might,  however,  have  a  special  use  in 
the  pure  synthesis  of  mathematics,  and  we  must  distinguish 
the  transcendental  synthesis  from  these  pure  syntheses.1  The 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  transcendental,  so  far  as  it  aims, 
not  at  the  construction  of  a  particular  figure  in  accordance  with 
a  particular  concept,  but  at  that  necessary  synthetic  unity  in  all 
flie  manifold  of  appearances  without  which  they  could  not  be 
appearances  of  objects.2 

However  paradoxical  it  may  seem,  Kant  believes  that  the 
transcendental  synthesis3  of  imagination  is  the  source  of  the 
affinity  of  appearances,  and  therefore  of  the  association  and 
reproduction  of  appearances  in  accordance  with  laws,4  and 
therefore  of  the  possibility  of  experience  itself.  Without  such 
a  transcendental  synthesis  no  concepts  of  objects  would  come 
together  into  one  experience.5 

1  The  transcendental  synthesis  is  of  course  present  in  these  pure 
syntheses,  as  it  is  in  every  empirical  synthesis.  Compare  Chapter 
XXV  §  14. 

a  A  123.  Compare  A  118  and  Chapter  XXV  §  9.  Kant  seems  to 
speak  here  as  if  the  imagination  itself  (so  far  as  it  is  a  power  of  a 
priori  synthesis  directed  to  necessary  unity)  were  the  transcendental 
function  of  imagination;  compare  A  78  =  B  103.  This  seems  to  me 
due  to  carelessness  in  language;  but  perhaps  the  word  ldiesey  (this) 
can  be  taken  as  referring  loosely,  not  to  imagination,  but  to  the  a 
priori  synthesis  itself,  which  can  properly  be  described  as  a  tran- 
cendental  function  of  imagination. 

8  Kant  says  'function*,  but  I  do  not  see  that  anything  is  added  by 
this  terminology,  unless  perhaps  it  is  intended  to  suggest  that  the 
transcendental  synthesis  is  formal  and  is  related  to  the  forms  or 
functions  of  judgement;  see  Chapter  XXIII  §§  6-7. 

4  Kant  seems  sharply  to  distinguish  Reproduction  in  accordance 
with  laws'  both  from  affinity  and  from  association.  Perhaps  'association* 
is  here  meant  strictly  for  the  subjective  ground,  the  tendency  in  our 
minds,  on  which  reproduction  rests  (A  121).  This  is  not,  however, 
very  satisfactory,  since  affinity  is  the  ground,  not  of  our  subjective 
tendency,  but  of  its  successful  exercise.  'Reproduction  according  to 
laws*  looks  a  little  like  the  'necessary  reproduction*  which  is  so  puzzling 
in  A  105-6  (see  Chapter  XX  §  7).  Perhaps  'laws*  is  here  equivalent 
only  to  'empirical  rules*,  but  compare  'universal  rules  of  a  thorough- 
going connexion  in  reproduction*  in  A  122. 

*  All  particular  concepts  (including  all  empirical  concepts)  depend 
upon  the  universal  transcendental  synthesis  which  is  involved  in  the 


486       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVI  §  8 

§  8.  Transcendental  Imagination  and  Apperception 

The  proof  of  transcendental  affinity  rests  on  the  contention 
that  transcendental  affinity  is  necessary  for,  and  is  implied  in, 
the  unity  of  apperception,  and  that  the  subjective  activity  by 
which  transcendental  affinity  is  realised  is  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination.  The  connexion  between  the  unity  of 
apperception  and  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
obviously  requires  further  explanation,  and  this  Kant  no^yv  offers 
us,  although  not  in  a  very  adequate  way.  At  the  same  time  he 
stresses  again  the  fundamental  importance  of  the  unity  of 
apperception,  and  the  parallel  between  it  and  time.1  In  our 
concern  with  imagination  we  must  not  forget  that  the 
unity  of  apperception  is  the  ultimate  ground  of  all  our 
knowledge. 

The  unity  of  apperception,  the  constant  and  unchanging 
'I'2  is  the  correlate  of  all  our  ideas,  so  far  as  it  is  possible3 
for  us  to  become  aware  of  them,  that  is,  to  be  aware  of  them 
as  ideas  of  something.4  All  empirical  consciousness  belongs  to 
one  all-comprehensive  pure  apperception,  as  all  sensuous 

particular  synthesis  corresponding  to  the  particular  concept.  Hence 
Kant  may  be  referring  to  particular  concepts  as  well  as  to  categories, 
but  he  may  have  in  mind  only  the  categories. 

1  A  123-4.  This  makes  what  looks  like  a  momentary  break  in  the 
argument,  and  enables  Vaihinger  to  maintain  that  we  have  here  the 
beginning  of  one  of  the  substrata  into  which  he  arbitrarily  divides 
this  argument.  In  view  of  my  conclusions  in  regard  to  his  main  strata, 
I  do  not  think  that  these  alleged  substrata  require  any  further  dis- 
cussion. The  suggestion  of  Adickes — that  this  paragraph  connects 
more  easily  with  the  first  paragraph  of  A  123  than  with  the  intervening 
paragraph  on  imagination,  and  consequently  that  the  paragraph  on 
imagination  is  a  later  insertion — has  more  plausibility.  Even  if  this 
is  true,  the  paragraph  on  imagination  is  necessary  to  the  argument. 

2  This  does  not  imply  that  the  soul  is  a  permanent  substance. 

3  This  may  be  a  reference  to  the  fact  that  ideas  exist  only  in  relation 
to  a  possible  consciousness.  See  A  120  and  §  2  above. 

4  I  introduce  the  last  clause  from  A  116,  where  Kant  adds  the 
necessary  parenthesis  to  the  statement  that  the  unity  of  apperception 
is  the  condition  of  the  possibility  of  all  ideas  (because  they  are  ideas 
of  something  only  through  the  fact  that  they  belong  with  all  others 
to  one  consciousness). 


XXVI  §  8]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  487 

intuition  (considered  as  an  idea)  belongs  to  the  pure 
intuition1  of  time.2  This  has  already  been  stressed  in  many 
places.3 

We  have  seen  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
works  in  conformity  with  the  unity  of  apperception  and  so 
produces  necessary  synthetic  unity  in  the  manifold  in  accordance 
with  the  categories.  We  have  now  to  add  that  pure  apperception 
must  bring  the  transcendental  synthesis  to  concepts4  and  so 
make  Explicit  the  principles  by  which  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  is  guided  and  controlled.5  In  other 
words  it  must  make  intellectual  what  in  itself  is  sensuous6; 
for  the  synthesis  of  imagination  is  always  sensuous,  even 
when  it  is  a  pure  synthesis  as  in  the  construction  of  a 
mathematical  figure.7 

This  doctrine  is  now  familiar  to  us,  both  as  regards  the 
categories  and  as  regards  particular  concepts.8  Imagination  by 
itself  could  give  us  only  pictures  or  images,  but  because  one 
and  the  same  understanding  is  able  to  conceive  the  various 
principles  upon  which  imagination  synthetises  the  given 
manifold,  the  concepts  of  the  understanding  are  able  to  give 

1  Kant  calls  it  a  pure  inner  intuition ;  usually  it  is  the  form  of  inner 
intuition. 

2  Here,   as  so  often,    Kant  makes   time  parallel  to  the  unity  of 
apperception,  without  stating  (i)  that  only  through  the    unity  of 
apperception  is  time  one,  and  (2)  that  only  through  time,  and  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  time,  is  the  unity  of  apperception  the 
ultimate  principle  of  the  unity  of  the  manifold  in    consciousness.

4  Compare  A  78  =  B  104. 

5  It  may  be  objected  that  this  is  the  task  of  Transcendental  Logic ; 
but  Transcendental  Logic  is  for  Kant  carrying  out  more  systematically 
the  work  of  ordinary  thought.  Whenever,  for  example,  we  use  the  cate- 
gory of  cause  and  effect,  we  are  making  explicit  a  principle  by  which, 
even  if  we  are  unaware  of  it,  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
is  controlled.  Compare  Chapter  XIII  §  5.

7  Imagination  is  concerned  with  synthetising  intuitions,  not  with 
conceiving  the  principle  by  which  it  is  itself  guided.

us  knowledge  of  objects.1  This  doctrine  may  be  compared 
with  what  Kant  previously  called  the  synthesis  of  recognition. 

For  an  explanation  of  how  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
space  and  time  is  controlled  by  the  categories  we  must  await 
the  chapter  on  Schematism.  Kant  at  present  is  dealing  only 
with  the  most  general  character  of  the  relation  between  the 
unity  of  apperception  and  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination.  Imagination  is  the  connecting  link  between 
understanding  and  sensibility,  and  by  its  transcendental 
synthesis  it  connects  the  manifold  of  intuition  with  the  unity 
of  apperception ;  for  it  imposes  upon  the  manifold  that  neces- 
sary synthetic  unity  without  which  the  unity  of  apperception 
would  be  impossible.  Sensibility  by  itself  could  give  us  only 
appearances,  but  never  objects  of  empirical  knowledge,  and 
therefore  it  could  never  give  us  experience? 

§  9.  The  Categories 

In  all  this  exposition  'from  below  up'3  Kant  has  deliberately 
kept  the  categories  in  the  background,  just  as  he  did  in  the 
provisional  exposition.  He  now  gives  a  summary  review  of 
the  argument,  with  a  manifest  allusion  to  the  account  of  the 
threefold  synthesis,  and  suddenly  presents  us  with  the 
categories.4 

1  Here,  as  so  often,  it  is  not  absolutely  certain  whether  Kant  is 
talking  only  of  the  categories  or  of  all  concepts  (including  the  cate- 
gories). The  fact  that  they  *  belong  to  the  understanding*  suggests 
the  categories  (although  all  concepts  belong  in  a  sense  to  the  under- 
standing) ;  and  I  think  this  is  on  the  whole  supported  by  the  general 
context.  The  previous  mention  of  concepts,  at  the  end  of  A  123,  is 
also  ambiguous,  and  the  same  ambiguity  is  found  in  A  125.  It  is 
unfortunate  that  Kant  does  not  use  a  special  word,  such  as  'notion*, 
when  he  means  categories  as  opposed  to  particular  concepts.  See 
A  320  =  B  377. 

2  A  124.  This  is  an  admirably  clear  statement  of  the  essentially 
Critical  doctrine  which  is  stated  more  ambiguously  in  A  89  =  B  122, 
and  in  A  90  =  B  123.  See  Chapter  XVI  §  8.  8  A  119. 

4  In  the  first  edition  the  categories  always  appear  in  the  Deduction 
as  if  they  were  intended  to  be  a  dramatic  surprise,  following  necessarily, 
but  unexpectedly,  from  what  has  gone  before.  (See  Am,  A  119, 
and  the  present  passage.)  Kant  sometimes  treats  the  unity  of  apper- 


XXVI  §  g]        THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  489 

Experience  consists  in  apprehension,  association  or  repro- 
duction,1 and  recognition,  of  appearances.  These  are  empirical, 
although  apprehension  is  conditioned  by  time,  reproduction 
is  conditioned  by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination, 
and  recognition,  or  empirical  apperception,  is  conditioned  by 
pure  apperception.2  The  last  and  the  highest  of  these,  empirical 
recognition,  contains  concepts,  which  make  possible  the  formal 
unity  of  experience,  and  so  enable  us  to  have  empirical 
experience  of  objects  and  to  attain  truth.3 

What  are  these  concepts  ?  The  fact  that  they  make  possible 
the  formal  unity  of  experience  suggests  that  they  are  categories, 
b*ut  all  concepts  are  in  a  sense  the  source  of  unity.4 

One  could  have  wished  Kant  to  be  more  precise,  but  the 
interpretation  does  not  greatly  matter,  since  we  never  employ 
concepts  in  empirical  recognition  (or  in  judgement  of  intuitions) 
without  also  employing  categories.  These  concepts,  which  are 
grounds5  for  the  recognition  of  the  manifold,  so  far  as  they 
concern  only  the  form  of  an  experience  in  general ,  are  the 
categories* 

Here  again  one  would  have  liked  some  reference  to  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction  and  the  forms  of  judgement,  but  in 
the  light  of  all  that  has  been  said  there  is  no  difficulty  in  under- 
standing Kant's  meaning.7  The  categories  are  concepts  of  the 

ception  in  the  same  way  (e.g.  in  B  132,  the  beginning  of  §  13).  This 
method  produces  a  curious  abruptness,  which  some  have  mistaken 
for  inconsequence. 

1  Association  and  reproduction  seem  here  to  be  equated.  Contrast 
§  7  above,  p.  485  n.  4.  2  See  A  115-16. 

3  The  objective  validity  of  empirical  knowledge  is  equated  with 
truth,  since  to  have  valid  knowledge  of  objects  is  to  have  truth. 

4  Compare  A  78-9  =  B  104  and  A  105-6. 

5  This  may  mean  only  that  all  recognition  depends  upon  concepts. 
8  A  125.  The  words  'so  far*  are  either  restrictive,  showing  that  only 

some  of  the  concepts  mentioned  are  categories — this  is  perhaps  the 
most  natural  interpretation — or  else  they  mean  that  the  concepts 
referred  to,  because  they  make  possible  the  formal  unity  of  experience, 
are  categories. 

7  Vaihinger's  complaint  of  obscurity  (Die  Trawcendentale  Deduktion, 
pp.  59-60  =  37-8)  is  due  to  the  fact  that  he  has  not  understood 
what  has  been  said  before,  as  is  sufficiently  obvious  from  his  theory.

490      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXVI  §  9 

necessary  synthetic  unity  which  is  necessary  for  every  experi- 
ence and  for  every  object.1  They  are  a  priori  conditions  of 
the  thought  involved  in  experience,  and  they  make  experience 
possible,  so  far  as  the  form  of  thought  is  concerned.2  The  unity 
of  experience  and  the  intellectual  form  of  experience  are  the 
same  thing.3 

'All  formal  unity  in  the  synthesis  of  imagination  is  therefore 
grounded  upon  the  categories.'  The  synthesis  of  imagination 
to  which  Kant  here  refers  is  presumably  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination;  but  if  he  means  every  synthesis  of 
imagination  the  result  is  the  same,  for  the  transcendental 
synthesis  is  present  in,  and  is  the  condition  of,  every  synthesis. 
The  transcendental  synthesis  is  a  synthesis  in  accordance  with 
the  categories,  and  the  formal  unity  in  the  synthesis  is  imposed 
upon  all  appearances,  and  is  the  condition  of  their  agreement 
with  the  unity  of  apperception.  It  is  consequently  the  condition 
of  appearances  being  appearances  of  objects.4 

The  conclusion  of  the  whole  matter  is  this.  Just  as  the 
spatial  and  temporal  character5  of  appearances  is  determined 

1  A  79  =  B  105.  2  A  93  =  B  126. 

3  Compare  A  129-30.  Needless  to  say,  the  categories  are  present 
in  empirical  recognition  because  the  unity  of  apperception  is  present 
in  every  judgement.  Why  Kemp  Smith  (Commentary ',  p.  225)  should 
question  in  this  passage  a  doctrine  which  is  at  the  root  of  the  whole 
Critical  Philosophy  is  beyond  rny  comprehension.   It  is  the  more 
surprising  in  view  of  his  almost  excessive  insistence  that  the  categories 
articulate  every  judgement  as  a  whole.  See  Chapter  XV  §  3. 

4  The  text  is  so  corrupt  in  the  last  sentence  of  the  paragraph  in 
A  125  that  its  exact  meaning  can  hardly  be  determined.  Even  with 
Adickes*  emendation  the  empirical  use  of  imagination  is  said  to  be 
present  in  recognition,  which  seems  hardly  a  possible  statement  for 
Kant  to  make — at  any  rate  if  it  implies,  as  it  appears  to  do,  a  use 
distinct  from  reproduction,  association,  and  apprehension.  The  word 
'element'  may  refer  to  categories,  as  Kemp  Smith  suggests,  for  it  is 
so  used  in  A  96 ;  but  one  would  naturally  expect  the  sense  to  be  the 
same  as  in  the  immediately  preceding  sentence,  where  it  refers  to 
apprehension,  association,  reproduction,  and  recognition. 

6  That  is,  the  general  character,  not  the  particular  character,  for  the 
latter  is  determined  by  things-in-themselves.  We  know  a  priori  that 
everything  must  be  spatial  or  temporal,  but  we  do  not  know  a  priori 
what  shape  it  will  have,  or  how  long  it  will  last. 


XXVI  §9]       THE  REGRESSIVE  EXPOSITION  491 

by  human  sensibility,  so  the  unity  or  uniformity,  the  order 
and  regularity,  which  we  find  in  appearances  and  to  which 
we  give  the  name  of  'nature',1  is  imposed  by  the  character 
of  human  thought.  If  it  were  not  so  imposed  we  could  never 
say  that  there  was  necessary  unity  or  uniformity  in  the  world 
of  appearances.  Because  the  unity  of  nature  is  necessary  and 
universal,  it  must  have  its  ground,  not  in  things,  but  in  powers 
of  the  mind  which  are  the  original  source  of  a  priori  knowledge. 
The  unity  of  nature  is  due  to  the  subjective  conditions  or 
forms  of  human  thinking;  and  these  conditions  are  valid  of 
objects,  because  they  are  the  conditions  of  the  possibility  of 
experiencing  or  knowing  any  object  whatsoever. 

1  Natura  formaliter  spectata.  Compare  A  419  n.  =  B  446  n.  Here 
also  it  is  only  the  general  unity  or  uniformity  (not  particular  unities 
or  uniformities)  which  is  imposed  by  thought.  We  know  a  priori 
that  every  event  must  have  a  cause,  but  we  do  not  know  a  priori 
what  the  cause  must  be. 


CHAPTER    XXVII 
UNDERSTANDING   AND    NATURE 

§  i.   Understanding  as  a  Power  of  Rules 

We  have  now  reached  the  conclusion  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction,  but  Kant  adds  some  points  of  explanation.  The  first 
of  these  concerns  the  nature  of  understanding. 

Understanding  has  been  described  as  a  spontaneity  of 
knowledge,1  as  a  power  of  thought,2  and  as  a  power  of  concepts3 
or  of  judgements.4  It  is  now  described  as  a  power  of  rules,5 
and  that  in  two  senses:  firstly  because  it  seeks  to  discover 
the  empirical  rules  or  laws  of  nature,  and  secondly  because 
it  imposes  upon  nature  a  certain  number  of  necessary  and 
universal  laws. 

It  will  be  remembered  that  the  unity  of  apperception  in 
relation  to  the  synthesis  of  imagination  was  said  to  be  under- 
standing.6 The  unity  of  apperception  is  now  said  to  be  the 
rule,  and  the  power  or  faculty  of  these  rules  is  the  under- 
standing.7 

I  do  not  see  how  these  descriptions  can   be  made  fully 

1  Compare  A  51  =  B  75. 

2  Compare  A  15  =  B  29,  A  51  =  B  75,  and  A  97.  In  A  97  under- 
standing is  also  said  to  be  a  power  of  knowledge. 

3  Compare  A  68  =  B  93,  and  also  A  159-60  =  B  199. 

4  Compare  A  69  =  B  94.  6  A  126. 

6  See  A  119  and  Chapter  XXV  §  n.  Compare  B  134  n.  where  the 
synthetic  unity  of  apperception  as  a  faculty  may  be  identified  with 
understanding,  though  there  the  statement  is  ambiguous. 

7  A  127.  'The  unity  of  apperception  in  relation  to  the  manifold  of 
ideas  (that  is,  as  determining  the  manifold  by  one  idea)  is  the  rule.' 
The  meaning  of  this  is  obscure,  and  Kemp  Smith  translates  it  rather 
differently.  'One  idea*  I  take  to  be  a  concept;  the  German  is  'aus 
einer  einzigen',  and  '  Vorstellung'  must  be  understood.  I  do  not  under- 
stand why  Adickes  takes  the  'one  idea'  to  be  the  unity  of  apperception. 
If  Kant  had  said  'contains  the  rule'  rather  than  'is  the  rule' — and  he 
often  uses  'is*  and  'contains'  as  equivalent — the  statement  would  have 
been  easier  to  understand. 


XXVII  §  2]     UNDERSTANDING  AND  NATURE  493 

consistent  with  one  another.1  Kant  seems  to  take  the  unity 
of  apperception,  now  as  a  power  or  faculty,  and  now  as  the 
formal  unity  (or  even  the  formal  act)  present  in  all  acts  of 
judgement.2  As  a  power  or  faculty  it  appears  to  be  identical 
with  understanding. 

The  really  important  point  is  the  difference  between  empirical 
2nd  necessary  laws,  and  it  is  unfortunate  that  Kant  does  not 
consistently  use  the  words  'rule*  and  'law'  to  indicate  this 
difference. 

§  2.  Rules  and  Laws 

The  different  kinds  of  law  (if  'law'  may  be  used  as  a  general 
term  covering  'laws'  and  'rules')  ought  to  correspond,  approxi- 
mately if  not  precisely,  to  the  different  kinds  of  concept. 

Corresponding  to  the  categories  there  ought  to  be  original 
(or  non-derivative)  laws  which  are  strictly  universal  and 
necessary.  These  laws  are  the  Principles  of  the  Understanding, 
which  may  be  called  the  'Principles'  for  short.  They  apply  to 
objects  in  general. 

Corresponding  to  the  'predicates'3  there  ought  to  be 
derivative  laws  which  are  universal  and  necessary,  at  least 
in  a  sense.  The  predicables  however  seem,  unlike  the  categories, 
to  apply,  not  to  objects  in  general,  but  to  objects  of  outer 
sense.  If  so,4  the  corresponding  laws,  although  necessary,  are 

1  Kant  complicates  his  exposition  still  further  by  saying  (i)  that 
understanding  is  itself  the  source  of  the  laws  of  nature  (A  127),  and 
(2)  that  pure  understanding  is  in  the  categories  the  law  of  the  synthetic 
unity  of  all  appearances  (A  128);   but  the  second  statement  is  pre- 
sumably meant  to  convey  the  same  meaning  as  the  first. 

2  Compare  Chapter  XXI  §§  i  and  4  for  similar  ambiguities  in  regard 
to  apperception.  I  have  already  noted — Chapter  XXI  §  5 — that  Kant 
seems  at  times  to  equate  the  unity  of  apperception  with  the  act  of 
apperception :  it  is  even  more  puzzling  when  he  equates  the  unity  of 
apperception  with  the  power  of  apperception  or  understanding. 

8  See  A  82  =  B  108.  These  are  for  Kant  pure  but  derivative 
concepts. 

4  The  whole  question  of  the  application  even  of  the  categories  to 
objects  of  inner  sense  is  a  difficult  one,  in  regard  to  which  caution 
is  necessary. 


494     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVII  §  2 

not  completely  universal.  They  apply  to  some  objects, 
and  not  to  others,  and  may  be  called  particular  necessary 
laws.1 

There  ought  also  to  be  laws  corresponding  to  the  pure 
concepts  of  mathematics,  which  are  themselves  particular,  and 
not  universal,  concepts.  If  so,  there  ought  to  be  a  second  set 
of  particular  necessary  laws  of  a  more  limited  character  tharf 
the  previous  ones. 

It  is  enough  for  the  present  purposes  to  say  only  tha£  there 
are  particular  necessary  laws,  without  considering  any  dif- 
ferences that  there  may  be  among  them.2 

There  are  also  particular  empirical  laws  corresponding  to 
empirical  concepts.  They  are  to  be  found  most  conspicuously 
in  the  natural  sciences. 

Hence  there  are  at  least  three  different  kinds  of  law, 
(i)  Principles,  (2)  particular  necessary  laws,  and  (3)  particular 
empirical  laws.  The  last  may  be  called  simply  'empirical  laws/ 
for  we  could  never  know  that  an  empirical  law  was  strictly 
universal. 

We  require  three  words  for  the  three  kinds  of  law,3  but 
Kant  uses  only  two.  The  word  'law'  seems  to  cover  both 
'Principles'  and  'particular  necessary  laws',  while  'rule'  is  used 
for  'empirical  laws'.  That  is  to  say,  the  essential  characteristic 
of  law  is  its  necessity,  although  a  law  which  is  also  completely 
universal  is  a  law  in  the  fullest  sense,  and  the  Principles  are 
sometimes  described  simply  as  'laws'  and  opposed  to  'particular 
laws'4. 

1  These   are   set   forth   in   the   Metaphysische   Anfangsgrunde   der 
Naturwissenschaft,  and  belong,  not  to  Transcendental  Philosophy, 
but  to  the  Metaphysic  of  Nature.  See  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  470). 

2  I  am  not  sure  that  the  difference  suggested  could  be  maintained, 
since  (i)  pure  mathematics  is  not  concerned  with  objects  in  the 
strict  sense  (see  B  147),  and  (2)  the  particular  necessary  laws  of  science 
depend  upon  mathematics.  See  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  470). 

8  E.g.  Principles,  laws,  and  rules. 

4  B  165.  The  particular  laws  are  not  there  divided  into  necessary 
laws  and  empirical  rules. 


XXVII  §  3]  UNDERSTANDING  AND  NATURE  495 

§  3.  Kanfs  Own  Definitions 

The  definitions  of  'rule*  and  'law'  given  by  Kant  himself 
are  not  altogether  clear.  'Rules  so  far  as  they  exhibit  existence 
as  necessary1  (and  are  therefore  necessarily  involved2  in  know- 
ledge of  the  object)  are  called  laws'.3 

.  This  is  unfortunately  ambiguous,  since  if  by  'object'  Kant 
means  'object  in  general',  the  'laws'  are  the  Principles.  He  may, 
however,  mean  merely  that  where  we  have  necessity,  there  we 
have  law. 

His  other  definition  is  equally  difficult.4  'The  idea  of  a 
universal5  condition  in  accordance  with  which  a  certain6 
manifold  (therefore  in  the  same  kind  of  way7)  can  be  posited 
is  called  a  "rule",  and  if  it  must  be  so  posited,  is  called  a  "law".'8 

Whatever  the  difficulties  of  this  may  be,  a  law  is  clearly 
marked  by  necessity,  while  a  rule  is  not,  and  the  reference  to 
'a  certain  manifold'  suggests  that  particular  necessary  laws,  and 
not  merely  principles,  are  to  be  included  under  the  definition 
of  law. 

Unfortunately  Kant,  even  in  the  passage  which  we  are 
considering,  does  not  use  his  distinction  between  rule  and  law 
consistently,  and,  as  we  have  already  seen,9  he  talks  freely  of 

1  This  is  taken  from  a  correction  by  Kant  (Nachtrdge  LI  I)  quoted 
by  Raymund  Schmidt.  The  text  says,  'Rules  so  far  as  they  are  objective', 
but  this  is  obviously  a  mistake. 

2  'anhangen?   Kemp    Smith   translates   'and   therefore   necessarily 
depend  upon  knowledge  of  the  object*.  I  do  not  think  the  German 
can  mean  this,  and  it  makes  nonsense  of  the  distinction.  At  least 
some  laws,  namely  the  Principles,  do  not  depend  on  knowledge  of 
the  object,  while  all  rules  (as  opposed  to  laws)  most  certainly  do. 

8  A  126. 

4  A  113.  There  is  a  play  in  this  on  the  words  'gesetzt'  (posited) 
and  'Gesetz*  (law). 

5  'Universal'    here    covers    'general'    (or   'particular')    as   well   as 
'strictly  universal';  that  is  to  say,  it  covers  'all  of  a  kind*  as  well  as 
'absolutely  all'.  6  'gewisses.' 

7  ('mithin  auf  einerlei  Art9).  The  precise  meaning  of  this  I  do  not 
see,  and  therefore  translate  literally.  Perhaps  Kant  means  that  where 
we  have  similar  manifolds  given  we  can  posit  them  under  the  same

'a  priori  rules*.  He  also  talks  freely  of  'empirical  laws'.1 
Nevertheless  an  understanding  of  these  distinctions  is  essential, 
if  we  are  to  follow  his  argument. 

§4.  The  Understanding  as  Law-giver 

Kant  believes  in  a  hierarchy  of  rules  and  laws,  but  alj 
empirical  rules  and  all  particular  laws  are  only  particular 
determinations  of  the  universal  laws,  or  Principles,  which 
arise  a  priori  in  the  understanding  itself.  These  Principles 
are  not  borrowed  from  experience  like  empirical  rules.  They 
are  imposed  upon  appearances  by  the  understanding,  and 
thereby  make  experience  itself  possible.  Understanding  is  thus 
the  law-giver  for  the  world  of  nature,  and  it  can  be  so,  only 
because  the  world  of  nature  is  an  appearance  to  human  minds.2 

The  understanding  imposes  upon  nature  only  the  ultimate 
and  universal  laws,  as  Kant  is  careful  to  explain.  The  detailed 
empirical  laws  of  nature  can  no  more  be  derived  a  priori  from 
pure  understanding  than  the  infinite  variety  of  empirical 
intuitions  can  be  derived  a  priori  from  the  forms  of  space  and 
time.  Nevertheless  just  as  all  intuitions  must  be  spatial  and 
temporal,  whatever  be  their  empirical  form,  so  all  appearances 
of  objects  must  be  governed  by  the  universal  law  of  cause  and 
effect  (and  by  all  the  other  Principles),  whatever  be  the  detailed 
differences  which  we  can  learn  from  experience,  and  from 
experience  alone.3 

Kant  is  no  idealist,  if  an  idealist  is  taken  to  be  one  who 
believes  that  pure  thought  can  create  reality.4  Empirical 
reality  must  always  be  given  to  finite  minds  by  something 
other  than  themselves.  But  finite  minds  do  not  merely  receive 
the  given  passively  from  without;  they  also  determine  the 
form  of  the  given  in  certain  ultimate  and  universal  ways. 
They  can  receive  it,  and  must  receive  it,  only  under  the

XXVII  §  s]    UNDERSTANDING  AND  NATURE  497 

universal  forms  of  time  and  space,  which  depend  on  the  nature 
of  human  sensibility.  In  addition,  the  mind  as  active  imposes 
upon  the  manifold  given  in  time  and  space  its  own  necessary 
and  universal  laws,  so  that  nature  as  we  know  it  must  have 
unity  and  uniformity.  That  unity  and  uniformity  is  known 
2  priori,  and  is  not  a  generalisation  from  experience.  The 
particular  ways  in  which  that  uniformity  is  realised  can  be 
known  only  by  the  patient  investigations  of  science,  which 
depends  partly  upon  pure  mathematics,  but  always  to  a  greater 
3r  less  degree  upon  empirical  observation,  that  is,  upon 
experience. 

§  5.  The  Final  Summary 

The  final  summary1  repeats  emphatically  Kant's  central 
doctrine  that  if  the  objects  of  our  knowledge  were  things-in- 
themselves,  a  priori  knowledge  of  them  would  be  impossible. 
If  all  our  concepts  were  derived  by  abstraction  from  things-in- 
themselves,  then,  granting  that  things-in-themselves  might  be 
known,  all  our  concepts  would  be  empirical.2  If,  on  the  other 
hand,  some  concepts  were  derived  from  our  minds,  there 
would  be  no  ground  for  supposing  that  things-in-themselves 
must  correspond  to  these  concepts.  In  neither  case  could  we 
possess  a  priori  concepts  giving  us  knowledge  of  reality.  Only 
if  our  knowledge  is  concerned  with  appearances  alone,  is  it 
possible,  and  indeed  necessary,  that  we  should  possess  such 
a  priori  concepts ;  for  then  the  necessary  connexion  and  unity 
of  appearances  which  constitutes  the  essential  nature  of  the 
object  must  be  imposed  by  the  mind  itself,  and  can  be  known 
independently  of  the  varying  matter  which  is  given  to  sense. 

The  details  added  in  regard  to  the  unity  of  apperception 
and  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  are  merely 
a  summary  of  the  previous  argument  and  offer  no  new  diffi- 
culties ;  but  Kant  seems  to  stress  the  view  that  the  intellectual 
form  of  all  our  knowledge  of  objects — a  form  which  is  found 
in  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories — constitutes

2  This  is  the  contention  from  which  Kant  started  in  A  92  =  B  124-5. 


498     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVII  §  6 

a  formal  a  priori  knowledge  of  all  objects,  not  of  course  so  far 
as  they  are  given  to  sense,  but  so  far  as  they  are  thought,  as 
they  must  be  if  they  are  to  be  objects  at  all. 

§  6.  The  Patchwork  Theory 

The  detailed  analysis  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  as 
set  forth  in  the  first  edition,  is  now  complete.  I  do  not  claim 
to  have  established  the  soundness  of  its  conclusions,  and  still 
less  to  have  shown  that  it  is  well  arranged  or  well  expressed. 
I  do  claim  to  have  shown  that  so  far  from  being  a  collection 
of  unrelated  jottings,1  or  a  mishmash  of  contradictory  exposi- 
tions,2 it  is  an  argument,  a  coherent  argument,  and  an  argument 
on  the  grand  scale.  The  provisional  exposition  may  have  been 
composed  at  a  slightly  earlier  date  than  the  authoritative 
exposition;  but  it  contains  substantially  the  same  doctrine, 
and  is,  as  Kant  maintains,  necessary  for  the  full  understanding 
of  the  authoritative  exposition.  If  we  can  penetrate  beyond 
the  grammar  of  Kant's  thought  to  the  reality  which  he  is 
attempting  to  describe,  we  shall  see  that  the  changes  made 
in  the  authoritative  exposition,  when  they  are  not  confined 
to  matters  of  terminology,  are  such  changes  as  we  should 
expect  to  arise  when  the  doctrine  of  the  provisional  exposition 
has  been  thought  out  with  greater  clarity.

exaggerate  the  chaos  to  which  Vaihinger  has  reduced  the  Transcen- 
dental Deduction. 


CHAPTER    XXVIII 
THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION 

§  i .  The  Deduction  in  the  Second  Edition 

• 
In  the  second  edition   Kant  substituted  an  entirely  new 

version  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  retaining  however 
the  original  introduction.1  The  main  purpose  of  the  change 
was  not  to  add  anything  to  what  we  have  already  learned,  but 
to  clear  away  obscurities  and  difficulties  which,  even  in  Kant's 
time,  had  given  rise  to  misunderstanding.2 

That  there  are  many  such  obscurities  and  difficulties  cannot 
be  denied.  Among  these  may  be  mentioned  Kant's  failure 
to  explain  clearly  what  is  meant  by  a  category,  what  is  the 
distinction  between  apperception  and  inner  sense,  and  what 
is  the  relation  between  apperception  and  imagination.  These 
points  are  fundamental,  and  are  to  be  distinguished  from 
difficulties  due  to  carelessness  in  terminology  and  expression. 

A  still  greater  defect  of  the  earlier  version  is  that  it  does  not 
make  explicit  the  connexion  of  the  categories  with  the  forms 
of  judgement,  and  the  necessity  for  judgement  if  we  are  to 
have  knowledge  of  objects.  The  first  point  Kant  had  made 
clear  in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction,  while  the  second  is 
involved  in  the  connexion  between  the  concept  and  the  object3 
— to  call  understanding  a  power  of  concepts  or  a  power  of 
judgement  is  the  same  thing,  when  properly  understood.4 
Nevertheless  these  contentions  ought  to  have  been  emphasised 
in  the  Transcendental  Deduction  itself. 

Still  more  detrimental  to  the  understanding  of  Kant's 
argument  is  his  failure,  in  the  first  edition,  to  stress  sufficiently 
the  importance  of  time  as  the  connecting  link  between  ap- 
perception and  the  manifold  of  sense.  He  does  indeed  assert, 
at  the  very  outset,  that  his  whole  argument  rests  upon  the  fact 

1  Section  i,  §§  13-14.  The  last  paragraph  of  this  section  was  removed 
and  three  new  paragraphs  put  in  its  place.

Soo    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §  i 

that  all  our  cognitions  are  subject  to  time  as  the  form  of  inner 
sense.1  This  is  clear  enough  in  the  earlier  parts  of  his  pro- 
visional exposition  ;2  but  as  he  proceeds  time  is  so  little  empha- 
sised that  it  might  seem  to  be  a  mere  parallel8  to  the  unity 
of  apperception,  rather  than  the  medium  through  which  the 
categories  must  apply  to  the  sensible  world. 

Kant  has  made  it  clear  from  the  first  that  apart  from  pure 
intuition  there  could  be  no  Transcendental  Logic;4  that  a 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination,  as  pure,  must  be 
a  synthesis  of  time  and  space  ;6  and  that  only  by  a  pure  tran- 
scendental synthesis  can  the  categories  apply  to  objects.6  All 
this  is  confirmed  beyond  any  possibility  of  doubt  by  the 
subsequent  chapters  on  the  Schematism  and  the  Principles. 
Nevertheless  he  would  have  made  things  much  easier,  if  he 
had  explained  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction  itself  how  the 
categories  must  be  schematised  in  reference  to  time,  and  how 
— what  is  another  aspect  of  the  same  fact — the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination  must  work  through  the  medium  of  time. 

All  these  points  Kant  attempts  to  make  clearer  in  the  second 
edition.  The  new  account  gathers  the  argument  together, 
looking  back  towards  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  and  forward 
towards  the  chapter  on  Schematism.  In  my  opinion  it  is — even 
with  all  its  defects — the  firmest  and  most  intelligible  account 
which  Kant  has  given,  and  I  find  it  difficult  to  understand 
how  competent  critics  have  thought  otherwise.7 1  believe  Kant 
is  right  in  saying  that  it  does  not  add  anything  which  was  not 
implicit  in  the  first  edition,  and  the  suggestion  that  he  was 
retracting  the  views  there  expressed  seems  to  me  groundless. 
The  difference  between  the  two  editions  is  mainly  one  of

3  A  no,  A  123-4.  Compare  B  136,  B  144.  Time  stands  to  intuitions

7  Compare,  e.g.,  Prichard,  Kant's  Theory  of  Knowledge,  p.  161.  I  do 
not  of  course  deny  that  the  first  version  goes  into  more  detail  on 
many  points,  and  so  helps  greatly  towards  the  understanding  of  the 
second  version. 


XXVIII  §  2]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  501 

emphasis,  though  the  new  account  shows  an  increased  tendency 
to  treat  space  as  almost  on  an  equality  with  time,  and  is  more 
inclined  to  describe  imagination  as  understanding  working 
at  a  lower  level. 

§  2.  The  Objective  and  Subjective  Deductions 

In  spite  of  the  fact  that  in  the  first  edition  Kant  had  not 
grasped  the  shortest  method  of  proof,1  the  proof  in  the  second 
edition  is  not  noticeably  shorter. 

The  argument  falls  into  two  separate  parts,  the  first  of 
which  deals  with  the  pure  categories,  and  the  second  with  the 
categories  as  schematised.  In  other  words,  the  first  part  shows 
that  the  categories  are  principles  of  synthesis  imposed  by  the 
nature  of  discursive  thought  itself,  and  are  necessary  for  any 
intelligent  being  who  can  know  only  objects  given  in  in- 
tuition to  some  kind  of  sensibility ;  the  second  part  shows  how 
the  categories,  as  principles  governing  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination,  are  necessary  for  intelligent  beings 
possessed  of  human  sensibility  y  that  is,  possessed  of  a  sensi- 
bility which  involves  the  form  of  time. 

More  simply,  the  first  part  establishes  the  objective  validity 
of  the  pure  categories,  while  the  second  explains  the  sub- 
jective machinery  which  makes  understanding  possible  as  a 
faculty  of  human  knowledge. 

It  is  at  least  a  plausible  hypothesis  that  the  distinction 
between  the  two  halves  of  the  Deduction  in  the  new  version 
is  a  distinction  between  the  objective  and  subjective  sides 
of  the  Deduction.2  If  so,  on  this  point  also  Kant  has  now 
disentangled  for  us  what  has  hitherto  been  confused.  For  this 
reason  I  have  called  the  present  chapter  'The  Objective  Deduc- 
tion' and  the  following  chapter  'The  Subjective  Deduction'.3 

The   difference   between  the   two   halves   is   explained   in 

1  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  476  n.). 

2  See  A  XVI-XVII  and  Chapter  XI  §  n. 

8  I  do  not  claim  that  in  the  first  edition  Kant  distinguished  the 
Objective  and  Subjective  Deductions  precisely  in  this  way,  as  it  is 
possible  that  he  did  not  at  first  think  out  the  distinction  clearly. 


So*    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVIII  §  3 

§  21  of  the  Deduction,1  and  it  is  convenient  to  regard  the 
second  half  as  beginning  at  §  22 .2 

§  3.  Summary  of  the  Objective  Deduction 

The  whole  argument  in  the  second  edition  is  divided  into 
a  number  of  subsections.3  It  is  not  easy,  even  with  the 'help 
of  Kant's  own  headings,4  to  be  sure  what  is  the  main  point 
of  each  subsection,  but  the  skeleton  of  the  Objective  Deduction 
is  roughly  as  follows. 

Synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  is  necessary  for 
knowledge  of  objects,  and  is  due  to  understanding  (§15). 

The  unity  of  apperception  is  necessary  for  synthesis  of  the 
manifold  of  intuition,  and  is  itself  impossible  apart  from  such 
a  synthesis  (§  16). 

Knowledge  of  objects  therefore  depends  on  the  unity  of 
apperception  (§17). 

The  unity  of  apperception  is  an  objective  unity,  that  is, 
it  involves  the  unity  of  the  object  known.  It  must  be  dis- 
tinguished from  a  merely  subjective  unity,  that  is,  from  the 
unity  which  ideas  have  because  they  happen  to  be  associated 
in  our  minds  (§  18). 

The  synthesis  of  the  manifold  under  the  unity  of  appercep- 
tion takes  place  by  means  of  judgements  (§19). 

Hence  the  given  manifold,  if  it  is  to  be  synthetised  under 
the  unity  of  apperception,  and  so  to  be  an  object  of  knowledge, 
must  be  determined  in  relation  to  the  form  of  judgement. 
It  must  therefore  conform  to  a  category,  and  indeed  to  all  the 
categories,5  since  the  categories  are  the  forms  of  judgement 

1  Such  references  in  the  next  two  chapters  apply  to  subsections 
of  the  Deduction  in  the  second  edition,  and  not  (unless  expressly 
stated)  to  the  subsections  of  these  chapters. 

2  §§  22-3  might  be  regarded  as  an  appendix  to  the  first  half. 

3§§  I5~2>7-  In  the  present  chapter  I  have  tried  to  make  my  own 
divisions  follow  those  of  Kant  even  at  the  expense  of  making  them 
unduly  long. 

4  These  are  sometimes  illuminating,  and  should  not  be  ignored. 

5  The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  general  form  of  judgement  articu- 
lates itself  into  different  forms,  and  an  object  which  is  determined 


XXVIII  §  4]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  503 

so  far  as  these  forms  determine  the  manifold  of  intuition 

(§20). 

§  20  is  the  essence  of  the  Objective  Deduction. 

The  whole  argument  is  an  analysis  of  the  formal  element 
contributed  by  thought  to  our  knowledge  of  objects  and  so 
to  objects  as  known.  We  must  not  forget  that  Kant  is  dealing 
•in  abstraction  with  one  element  in  knowledge  or  experience, 
just  as  he  is  in  the  Aesthetic.  If  we  fail  to  remember  this,  we 
shall,  in  the  one  case  as  in  the  other,  be  unable  to  understand 
his  doctrine. 

§  4.  Combination  or  Synthesis 

All  synthesis  (here  identified  with  combination1)  is  said 
to  be  the  work  of  understanding.  It  is  an  act  of  the  mind,  and 
cannot  be  ascribed  to  sense,  which  is  passive.  The  manifold 
of  ideas  can  be  given  in  a  sensuous  intuition,  but  it  can  never 
be  united  by  sense.2  It  must  indeed  be  given  under  certain 
forms  (space  and  time),  which  are  due  to  the  nature  of  our 
sensibility  and  are  not  the  products  of  our  thought.  Neverthe- 
less space  and  time,  considered  as  existing  for  sense  alone, 
have  no  unity  or  combination  in  themselves,3  and  cannot 
be  the  source  of  unity  or  combination  in  the  empirical  manifold. 

In  this  passage4  Kant  apparently  considers  understanding 
to  be  the  source  of  all  the  mind's  activity  or  spontaneity,  and 
the  only  antithesis  mentioned  is  that  between  passive  sense 
and  active  understanding.6  This  suggests  that  he  regards 
imagination  as  understanding  working  at  a  lower  level;6  yet 
although  he  speaks  of  combination  in  general,  he  is,  I  believe, 

by  the  general  form  of  judgement  must  be  determinable  by  all  forms 
of  judgement.

2  Compare  A  99,  where  Kant  says  it  can  never  be  'represented  as

by  sense  into  an  object  (or  concrete  thing).

504    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVIII  §  4 

thinking  only  of  that  kind  of  combination  which  is  necessary 
for  an  object.1  An  objective  combination  (or  objective  unity) 
requires  thought  (as  well  as  imagination)  and  is  to  be  dis- 
tinguished from  the  subjective  combination  of  ideas  in  our 
mind  through  mere  imagination.2 

Synthesis  may  be  of  various  kinds.  It  may  be  a  synthesis 
of  intuitions  either  empirical  or  pure,3  or  it  may  be  a  synthesis- 
of  concepts.4  These  syntheses  are  not  to  be  regarded  as  mutually 
exclusive;  for  all  of  them  may  be  involved  in  the  same  act 
of  judgement.  Furthermore  we  may  or  may  not  be  conscious 
of  the  act  of  synthesis.5  In  all  cases  the  synthesis  is  said  to  be 
an  act  of  understanding,  and  this  seems  to  imply  that  it  is  an 
act  of  judgement.6 

Difficulties  may  be  felt  in  thus  ascribing  to  judgement, 
or  even  to  understanding,  the  synthesis  of  intuitions.  In  the 
Metaphysical  Deduction  Kant  described  the  function  of 
judgement  (or  of  understanding)  as  giving  unity  to  the  imagina- 
tive synthesis  of  different  ideas  (or  sensa)  in  an  intuition;7 
and  if  we  distinguish  between  understanding  and  imagination, 

1  B  130:  'We  cannot  represent  anything  as  combined  in  the  object , 
unless  we  have  ourselves  already  combined  it,  and  of  all  ideas  combina- 
tion is  the  only  one  which  cannot  be  given  through  objects.'  In  B  129 
he  speaks  of  the  combination  of  a  manifold  in  general.  This  may  imply 
that  he  is  thinking  of  that  (objective)  combination  which  is  always 
the  same,  whatever  particular  manifold  be  given :  if  he  means  objective 
combination,  he  is  surely  right  in  saying  it  cannot  come  through 
sense. 

2  Compare   B  141.   The    detailed    discussion  of   imagination    is 
reserved  for  the  Subjective  Deduction;  see  §  24. 

8  Kant  says  *  sensuous  or  non-sensuous',  but  this  seems  to  be  a 
slip  for  'empirical  or  non-empirical' . 

4  For  example,  a  synthesis  of  the  subject-concept  and  the  predicate- 
concept,  using    these  terms  in  their  widest   sense.   Even  a  hypo- 
thetical or  disjunctive  judgement  is  a  synthesis  of  concepts  inasmuch 
as  it  is  a  synthesis  of  judgements  which  in  turn  are  syntheses  of 
concepts. 

5  Compare  A  103,  A  117  n.,  and  Chapters  XIX  §  8  and  XXV  §  6. 
8  Compare  §  19  and  also  A  69  =  B  94:  'All  acts  of  understanding 

can  be  reduced  to  judgement.' 

7  See  A  79  =  B  104-5.  The  phrase  'mere  synthesis'  implies  that 
the  synthesis  is  imaginative;  see  Chapter  XIV  §  3. 


XXVIII  §  4]     THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  505 

we  must  say  that  understanding  imposes  synthetic  unity 
on  the  given  manifold  only  through  the  activity  of  imagination. 
At  present  Kant  seems  anxious  not  to  make  this  distinction:1 
he  is  concerned  only  with  the  synthesis  (or  unity)  of  intuitions 
so  far  as  it  is  demanded,  and  (as  he  believes)  imposed,  by 
thought  itself.  It  is  enough  to  say  that  if  we  consider  judgement 
'concretely,  it  involves  synthesis  of  a  given  manifold  of  in- 
tuition,2 and  not  merely  a  synthesis  of  concepts.3  Indeed  it  is 
on  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  that  Kant  seems 
to  lay  the  greater  stress,  the  synthesis  through  which  alone 
we  can  have  knowledge  of  an  object. 

This  act  of  synthesis  must  be  one  act,  if  it  is  to  unite  a  given 
manifold ;  and  it  must  be  the  same  act,  no  matter  what  be  the 
differences  in  the  manifold  united.4  Analysis,  which  is  supposed 
to  be  its  opposite,  always  presupposes  it;  for  we  cannot  analyse 
anything,  unless  we  are  holding  it  together  before  the  mind.5 
It  is  only  because  understanding  has  combined  the  manifold, 

1  He  seems  to  avoid  reference  to  the  subjective  machinery  of 
cognition  at  this  stage  of  the  argument.  No  doubt  understanding 
and  sensibility  as  well  as  imagination  may  be  regarded  as  belonging 
to  that  subjective  machinery;  but  their  connexion  with  the  concepts 
and  intuitions  necessary  to  knowledge  is  commonly  accepted,  whereas 
the  part  played  by  imagination  is  a  doctrine  peculiar  to  Kant  himself. 
Furthermore  imagination  is  bound  up  with  time,  since  it  is  a  power 
of  representing  an  object  which  is  not  present  to  intuition  (see  B  151) ; 
and  here  we  are  considering  synthesis  without  special  reference  to 
time.  Perhaps  he  has  also  in  mind  the  view  which  he  makes  explicit 
later — see  B  162  n. — that  imagination  is  understanding  working  at 
a  lower  level. 

2  This  is  the  central  doctrine  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  and 
need  not  be  further  elaborated  here.  It  applies  to  conception  as  well 
as  judgement,  if  we  distinguish  conception  from  judgement. 

3  I  think  Kant  means  to  assert  that  there  is  a  synthesis  of  concepts 
in  all  judgements,  including  analytic  judgements;  see  B  131  n.  In 
the  logical  functions  of  judgement  combination  and  therefore  unity 
of  given  concepts  is  said  to  be  thought ;  see  B  1 3 1 .  The  context  leaves 
little  doubt  that  this  unity  is  a  synthetic  unity. 

4  B  130:  'It  is  originally  one,  and  is  the  same  (gleichgeltend)  for  all 
combination.*  Kant  is  thinking  of  the  act  of  synthesis  so  far  as  it  is 
involved  in  judgement  as  such;  compare  his  doctrine  of  the  unity 
of  apperception  in  A  107  ff. 

5  Compare  A  77  =  B  103  and  B  133  n. 


So6    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVIII  §  4 

that  we  can  suppose  the  manifold  to  be  given1  as  a  whole 
which  requires  analysis.2 

Synthesis,  as  always  for  Kant,  involves  not  only  unity  of  the 
act  of  synthesis,  but  also  unity  of  the  manifold  synthetised. 
He  speaks  as  if  he  were  engaged  in  an  analysis  of  the  concept 
of  'combination';  and  finds  that  this  concept  carries  with  it, 
not  only  a  concept  of  the  manifold3  and  a  concept  of  its 
synthesis,4  but  also  a  concept  of  the  unity  of  the  manifold. 
'Combination  is  representation  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the 
manifold.' 

Here  again  Kant  does  not  distinguish  the  different  factors 
at  work — (i)  the  synthesis  of  imagination  and  (2)  the  bringing 
of  the  synthesis  to  concepts.5  The  exact  interpretation  of  his 
view  is  difficult;  for  'representation'  is  ambiguous.6  On  the 
whole  I  take  him  to  mean  merely  that  combination  involves 
conception  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold.7 

1  Note  that  'given'  is  a  relative  term.  We  can  regard  all  our  past 
knowledge  as  given  for  subsequent  analysis,  and  we  can  regard  the 
whole  world  as  given  to  us,  if  we  ignore  the  fact  that  it  must  be  taken 
or  thought  as  well  as  given.  See  §  n  of  this  chapter. 

2  I  am  supposing  that  Kant  has  in  view  primarily  the  synthesis 
and  analysis  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  (as  united  into  an  object 
or  objects) ;  but  it  is  equally  true  that  the  analysis  of  a  concept  pre- 
supposes a  synthesis  of  the  elements  which  that  concept  contains. 
The  synthesis  may  of  course  give  us  a  cognition  which  is  *  rough  and 
confused'  and  in  need  of  analysis;  see  A  77  =  B  103. 

3  This  suggests  that  in  all  combination — even  in  combination  of 
concepts — the  manifold  of  intuition  must  be  combined. 

4  This  second  concept  seems  to  be  superfluous.  I  cannot  see  that 
Kant  is  making  any  distinction  between  'synthesis'  and  'combination*  : 
they  are  both  described  as  'acts'  in  B  130. 

5  Compare  A  77-8  =  B  103.  By  bringing  the  synthesis  to  concepts 
we  conceive  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  and  so  attain  to 
knowledge  of  an  object. 

6  It  may  in  itself  be  used  either  for  intuition  or  for  conception 
or  for  the  union  of  intuition  and  conception  in  knowledge. 

7  The  fact  that  Kant  uses  the  word  'is'  in  place  of  'involves'  is 
not,  I  think,  fatal  to  this  interpretation;  for  he  uses  the  word  'is* 
very  loosely.  He  can  hardly  intend  to  identify  combination  with  concep- 
tion of  synthetic  unity  to  the  exclusion  of  the  imaginative  synthesis 
of  intuitions.  I  doubt  also  whether  he  could  intend  in  this  sentence 
to  identify  combination  with  the  whole  work  of  understanding  and 


XXVIII  §  4]     THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  507 

The  objection  may  be  raised  that  combination  or  synthesis 
is  independent  of  conception,  and  that  conception,  whether 
it  be  regarded  as  conception  of  the  principle  governing  the 
synthesis  or  as  conception  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  mani- 
fold, is  itself  distinct  from  synthesis.  We  must  however  remem- 
ber that  for  Kant  the  understanding  in  conceiving  or  judging 
Hoes  not  merely  recognise  the  principle  governing  the  synthesis 
and  the  unity  of  the  manifold  thereby  produced:  it  imposes 
the  ultimate  principles  governing  the  synthesis,  and  so  imposes 
certain  kinds  of  synthetic  unity  on  the  manifold  synthetised.1 
Kant  may  have  this  point  in  mind  when  he  says  that  represen- 
tation— which  I  take  to  be  conception — of  this  synthetic  unity 
cannot  therefore  arise  out  of  combination.2  On  the  contrary, 
by  being  added  to  the  representation3  of  the  manifold  it  makes 
the  concept  of  combination  possible.4 

Much  of  this  is  obscure,  but  Kant's  central  doctrine  is  clear 
enough:  the  act  of  understanding — and  therefore  presumably 
judgement — is  an  act  of  synthesis  which  involves,  or  pre- 
supposes, conception  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  a  manifold  given 
to  sense.5  To  this  it  may  be  objected  that  on  his  own  showing 

imagination  as  manifested  in  knowledge — if  he  did,  it  would  be 
more  natural  to  say  that  combination  is  representation  of  objects. 
On  my  view  he  is  merely  restating  what  he  has  said  in  the  previous 
sentence ;  and  both  the  preceding  and  the  succeeding  sentences  seem 
to  imply  that  combination  is  not  to  be  identified  with  conception 
of  synthetic  unity,  which  is  only  one  of  the  elements  in  it. 

1  Compare  Chapter  XIV  §  3. 

2  B  131.  I  confess  that  the  reason  for  using  'therefore*  is  not  clear 
to  me.  So  far  as  I  can  see,  Kant  means  that  the  representation  (or 
conception)  of  synthetic  unity  cannot  arise  out  of  combination,  because 
it  is  present  in,  and  presupposed  by,  combination. 

3  I  suppose  'representation'  here  must  mean  'intuition*.  'Addition* 
is  not  a  very  satisfactory  term  to  express  the  relation  between  the 
concept  of  synthetic  unity  and  the  intuitions  which  are  united  under  it. 

4  Perhaps  he  means  that  only  because  we  conceive  the  manifold 
to  be  united  in  an  object  can  we  acquire  the  concept  of  'combination* 
by  analysis ;  but  the  statement  is  obscure. 

5  This  manifold  is  described  in  B  129  as  a  'manifold  in  general*. 
The  phrase  warns  us  that  the  manifold  in  question  is  not  necessarily 
to  be  regarded  as  given  to  human  senses  under  the  forms  of  time  and 
space;  see  Chapter  XXIX  §  2. 


5o8    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §  4 

some  judgements  are  analytic.  Kant  replies  that  the  distinction 
between  analytic  and  synthetic  judgements  is  here  irrelevant.1 
It  is  true  that  in  judgements  the  concepts2  employed  may  be 
identical  in  the  sense  that  one  can  be  thought  analytically 
through  the  other.  Nevertheless  we  must  distinguish  con- 
sciousness of  the  one  from  consciousness  of  the  other;  and  the 
relevant  point  here  is  that  there  must  be  a  synthesis  of  such 
(possible)  consciousness. 

I  believe  Kant  to  hold  that  even  in  analytic  judgements 
there  is  a  synthesis  of  concepts.3  His  main  point  here,  however, 
is  that  consciousness  of  the  one  concept  differs  from  conscious- 
ness of  the  other,  so  far  as  the  manifold  referred  to  by  these 
concepts  enters  into  the  question.  In  the  judgement  'All  bodies 
are  divisible'  we  may  say  that  the  concept  of  'divisibility*  is 
already  thought  in  the  concept  of  'body'.  Nevertheless  the  two 
concepts  do  not  refer  to  the  same  manifold,  since  the  concept 
of  divisibility  is  'wider'  or  'higher'  than  the  concept  of  'body';4 
and  if  our  consciousness  of  a  concept  involves  consciousness 
of  the  manifold  to  which  it  refers,  the  consciousness  of  the  one 
concept  must  be  different  from  that  of  the  other.5  Kant  seems 
to  have  in  mind  that  even  in  analytic  judgements  the  manifold 


1E  131  n. 

2  Kant  says  'ideas* ;  and  it  may  be  suggested  that  as  this  is  a  note 
to  the  statement  that  combination  is  representation  of  the  synthetic 
unity  of  the  manifold,  Kant  must  have  in  mind  analysis  of  intuitions, 
not  of  concepts.  If  this  were  true,  the  note  would  have  nothing  to  do 
with  analytic  judgements.  If,  however,  Kant  were  referring  to  intui- 
tions, he  could  hardly,  I  think,  say  that  one  is  thought  through  the 
other,  and  it  must   be  remembered  that  for  Kant  synthesis  of  the 
manifold  involves   concepts  and  concepts  involve  synthesis  of  the 
manifold. 

3  In  the  logical  functions  (or  forms)  of  judgement  combination  and 
therefore  unity  of  concepts  is  already  thought;  see  B  131.  As  I  pointed 
out  above,  this  unity  is  a  synthetic  unity. 

4  See  A  68-9  =  B  93-4. 

5  When  Kant  says  we  must  distinguish  consciousness  of  the  one 
concept  from  consciousness  of  the  other,  so  far  as  the  manifold  enters 
into  consideration,  he  may  have  in  mind  the  further  point  that  so  far 
as  the  form  of  thought  is  concerned  one  and  the  same  transcendental 
consciousness  must  be  present  throughout. 


XXVIII  §4]        THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  509 

must  be  synthetised  in  accordance  with  concepts  and  with 
their  union  in  the  judgement.1 

Every  judgement  is  a  synthesis,  not  only  of  concepts  (for 
example,  the  subject-  and  predicate-concepts),  but  also  of  the 
manifold  which  is  thought  under  these  concepts.  In  every 
judgement  we  think  that  the  manifold  is  united  or  combined  in 
accordance  with  the  concepts  used.2  The  unity  of  the  manifold 
is  therefore  thought  in  every  judgement  so  far  as  it  gives  us 
knowledge  of  objects. 

That  unity  of  the  manifold  which  is  involved  in  all  our 
thinking  (and  so  in  all  objective  combination)  is  not  a  blank 
numerical  unity  such  as  is  thought  in  the  category  of  unity.3 
It  is  a  synthetic  unity,  a  unity  of  different  elements.  We  may 
compare  it  with  the  qualitative  unity  which  is  to  be  found 
in  a  play  or  a  speech  or  a  story.4  It  is  involved  in  every  form 
of  judgement,5  and  not  merely  in  what  is  called  the  'quantity' 
of  judgement ;  for  in  every  form  of  judgement  we  think  the 
unity  of  different  concepts  and  consequently  of  the  manifold 
conceived  under  these  concepts.  The  manifold  has  to  be 

1  This  explains,  I  think,  why  the  note  is  appended  to  the  description 
of  combination  as  representation  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold. 
It  explains  also  the  reference  to  possible  consciousness.  In  an  analytic 
judgement  the  consciousness  of  each  concept  is  actual,  not  merely 
possible.  The  consciousness  of  the  manifold  to  which  the  concepts 
refer  is  alone  properly  described  as  possible;  and  the  characteristic 
of  analytic  judgements  is  that  in  them  we  make  no  appeal  to  actual 
intuition. 

2  This  is  true  when  we  say  'All  bodies  are  extended*,  as  well  as 
when  we  say  *  All  bodies  are  heavy*.  Kant  has  in  mind,  not  the  analytic 
unity  of  different  bodies  in  virtue  of  their  common  characteristics, 
such  as  extension  and  heaviness,  but  the  synthetic  unity  whereby 
extension  and  heaviness  are  combined  in  each  body,  for  example, 
as  accidents  of  a  substance. 

8  The  category  of  unity  is  the  concept  of  a  unit  homogeneous  with 
other  units.  In  counting  we  ignore  the  internal  differences  of  what 
we  count. 

4  See  B  114.  Note  that  in  B  131  Kant  seems  to  describe  this  unity 
indifferently  as  a  unity  of  the  manifold  and  a  unity  of  concepts. 

6  It  is  to  be  observed  that  'combination'  or  'unity  of  concepts'  is 
thought  in  the  logical  forms  of  judgement.  Yet  Kant  is  said  not  to 
have  recognised  the  presence  of  synthesis  in  every  judgement,  and 
to  have  confined  the  forms  of  judgement  to  analytic  judgements. 


5io     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §  5 

united  in  accordance  with  all  the  categories,  and  its  synthetic 
unity  is  to  be  sought,  not  merely  in  one  category  or  in  one  form 
of  judgement,  but  in  the  ultimate  ground  of  all  judgement 
and  all  thought.1 

§  5.  The  Synthetic  Unity  of  Apperception 

i 

The  ultimate  ground  of  all  judgement  and  all  thought', 
whether  that  thought  is  analytic  or  synthetic,  is  pure  or  original 
apperception.  This  is  described  as  an  act  of  spontaneity  and 
is  identified  with  the  idea  'I  think'  which  must  be  able2  to 
accompany  all  my  ideas  ;3  but  it  is  also  described  as  that  self- 
consciousness  which  produces  the  idea  'I  think'.4 

The  reason  why  the  idea  *I  think'  must  be  able  to  accompany 
all  my  ideas  is  that  otherwise  they  would  not  be  ideas  of  any- 
thing, or  in  other  words  they  would  not  be  ideas  of  any  object.5 

1  Note  that  the  ground  of  synthetic  unity  is  also  the  ground  of  the 
possibility  of  understanding  even  in  its  logical  use.  The  logical  use 
seems  here  to  be  connected  with  the  unity  of  different  concepts  in 
judgement;  but  it  must  cover  the  whole  use  described  in  Formal 
Logic  and  manifested  in  all  judgement  so  far  as  judgement  unites 
a   plurality  of  different  individual  objects   under  general   concepts 
obtained  by  abstraction  and  analysis ;  see  A  67  =  B  92  ff.  and  Chapters 
XII  §  5  and  XIV  especially  §§  2  and  8.  If  there  were  no  synthesis  of 
the  manifold,  there  could  be  no  objects  and  no  objective  world;  and 
consequently  we  could  never  acquire  concepts  of  these  objects  by 
analysis  nor  unite  these  different  concepts  in  judgement  on  the  basis 
of  such  analysis. 

2  The  reason  why  Kant  says  'must  be  able  to  accompany*  rather 
than  'must  accompany'  is,  I  presume,  that  the  'I  think'  need  not  be 
made  explicit  in  consciousness;  see  A  117  n.  and  also  B  134.  He 
may  also  have  in  mind  the  fact  that  ideas  may  have  some  sort  of 
existence,  if  they  are  related  to  a  possible  consciousness;  see  A  120. 

3  B  131-2.  This  confirms  the  view  that  the  synthesis  which  Kant 
has  hitherto  described  is  the  synthesis  involved  in  judging  an  object, 
and  not  merely  an  imaginative  synthesis.  We  might  call  it  the  synthesis 
of  recognition.  For  some  reason  Kant  seems  anxious  to  keep  judge- 
ment (and  its  connexion  with  objects)  in  the  background,  till  he  comes 
to  §  19,  but  it  is  clearly  present  in  his  thought  throughout. 

4  Here  apperception  might  be  taken  as  a  power  rather  than  an 
act ;  compare  Chapter  XXI  §  4. 

6  B  132;  compare  A  116.  Kant  says  'Otherwise  there  would  be  an 
idea  in  me  of  something  which  could  not  be  thought* ;  and  he  adds 


XXVIII  §5]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  511 

At  the  present  8tage,  however,  Kant  is  apparently  avoiding 
reference  to  objects,1  and  a  little  later  he  urges  the  necessity 
of  pure  apperception  on  the  ground  that  without  it  my  ideas 
would  not  be  my  ideas.2  But  this  seems  merely  to  assert  the 
same  point  in  another  way ;  for  the  only  reason  why  my  ideas 
must  be  my  ideas  (or  ideas  belonging  to  one  and  the  same 
self-cbnsciousness)  is  that,  unless  they  were,  they  could  not 
possess  unity  and  so  be  ideas  of  objects  in  one  objective  world.3 

It  is  this  fact  which  enables  us  to  say  that  although  in- 
tuitions are  ideas  which  can  be  given  prior  to  all  thought,4 
they  have  nevertheless  a  necessary  relation  to  pure  appercep- 
tion.5 

Here,  as  always  in  Kant,  pure  apperception  involves  self- 
consciousness,  at  least  potentially:  it  is  consciousness  of  the 
act  of  thinking,  and  to  think  is  to  be  potentially  conscious 
of  thinking.  As  pure  it  is  consciousness  of  the  act  of  thinking6 
in  abstraction  from  the  matter  of  thought,  and  so  is  distin- 
guished from  empirical  apperception.  It  is  also  'original'  and 

that  such  an  idea  would  be  impossible,  or  at  least  would  be  nothing 
for  me.  The  meaning  of  this  is  not  too  clear,  but  in  the  light  of  B  137 
I  think  Kant  is  reasserting  the  doctrine  of  the  first  edition.  See 
also  B  144  n.  Kant's  whole  proof  rests  on  our  conception  of  that 
unity  of  intuition  whereby  an  object  is  constituted — a  unity  which 
involves  both  synthesis  of  a  given  manifold  and  relation  to  the  unity 
of  apperception. 

1  Though  'object'  is  mentioned  incidentally  in  B  130. 

2  B  132-3.  Note  that  Kant  has  in  mind  the  manifold  ideas  given 
in  one  definite  intuition  (in  einer  gewissen  Anschauung) — presumably 
the  intuition  of  an  object.  Note  also  that  as  my  ideas  they  must 
conform  to  the  condition  under  which  alone  they  can  stand  together 
in  one  universal  self-consciousness.  We  should  have  been  grateful 
if  Kant  had  stated  clearly  whether  this  universal  self-consciousness 
is  to  be  regarded  as  present  in  the  intuitions  of  other  men  as  well 
as  in  my  other  intuitions;  and  whether  it  extends  beyond  the  actual 
intuitions  of  human  beings  to  possible  intuitions.  Compare  Chapter 
XXIV  §  4. 

3  Kant  explicitly  disclaims  the  view  that  I  am  necessarily  conscious 
of  them  as  my  ideas ;  compare  A  103-4  and  A  1 17  n. 

4  This  may  mean  only  'independently  of  thought'.  It  is  the  doctrine 
which  is  alleged  to  be  un- Critical  in  A  89  =  B  122. 

6  Or  to  understanding;  compare  A  119. 
6  Presumably  as  regards  its  form. 


512    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §5 

not  derivative:  that  is  to  say,  it  produces — or  is — the  idea 
*I  think',  which  is  one  and  the  same  in  all  consciousness,  and 
must  be  able  to  accompany  all  my  ideas,  but  is  not  derived1 
from  any  of  them. 

The  unity  of  apperception  is  transcendental  as  the  ultimate 
condition  of  knowledge,  and  as  the  source  of  further  a  priori 
knowledge.2 

So  far  we  have  seen  that  if  ideas  are  to  be  ideas  of  an  object, 
they  must  be  united  in  one  potentially  self-conscious  thinking, 
or  in  other  words  must  be  related  to  the  unity  of  apperception. 
We  have  now  to  look  at  this  from  the  other  side.  The  unity 
of  apperception  is  itself  impossible  apart  from  synthesis  of  the 
given  manifold,  and  consciousness  of  this  synthesis.3  As  always 
in  Kant,  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  unity  of  the  manifold 
mutually  condition  one  another,  if  indeed  they  are  not  to  be 
regarded  as  identical  with  one  another.4 

In  supporting  this  contention  Kant  is  able  to  explain  more 
clearly  what  he  means  by  self-consciousness,  and  why  he 
identifies  the  unity  of  apperception,  not  with  mere  self-identity, 
but  with  consciousness  of  self-identity. 

It  is  obvious  that  an  idea,  at  any  rate  if  it  is  to  be  a  'clear' 
idea,  must  be  accompanied  by  consciousness.  But  Kant  is  not 
talking  about  empirical  consciousness  of  this  kind.  He  is  not 
saying  merely  that  there  must  be  awareness  of  this  followed 
by  awareness  of  that.5  To  say  this  is  to  break  up  our  experience,

sion of  momentary  awarenesses,  or  momentary  selves,  as

for  'abgeleitet*  (derived),  which  is  the  correct  an thi thesis  to  'urspriing- 
lich'   (original).    If  an  idea  A  must  be  able  to  accompany  ideas 
B,C,D,  .  .  .,  then  surely  idea  A  can  be  accompanied  by  ideas  B,C, 
D,  .  .  .  Kemp  Smith  retains  the  original  text. 

2  Kant  mentions  here  only  the  latter  point.  Compare  A  106-7  and 
A  1 1 6.  Note  also  that  the  phrase  'unity  of  apperception'  seems  intended 
to  imply  that  the  idea  *I  think*  must  be  one  and  the  same  in  all 
consciousness.  No  other  explanation  of  the  phrase  is  given.

unconscious.      *  Compare  A  105,  A  109,  B  137,  and  Chapter  XX  §  3.

diversified  and  transient  as  the  ideas  of  which  they  are  aware. 
Such  a  view  destroys  the  very  possibility  of  knowledge. 

The  unity  of  apperception,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  con- 
dition of  the  possibility  of  knowledge.  It  is  not  to  be  found 
in  the  fact  that  every  idea  is  accompanied  by  consciousness. 
It  is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that  I  add  one  idea  to  another, 
or  conjoin  one  idea  with  another,  and  am  conscious  of  this 
act  of  synthesis.1  It  is  only  because  I  can  combine  the  manifold 
of  ideas  in  one  consciousness  that  I  can  represent  to  myself 
the  identity  of  consciousness  in  these  ideas.2 
,  Kant  puts  this  point  more  technically  by  saying  that  the 
analytic  unity  of  apperception  presupposes  the  synthetic. 

The  analytic  unity  of  apperception  appears  to  be  the  unity 
of  thought  which  is  manifested  in  uniting  different  ideas  (or 
objects)  under  a  common  concept  by  means  of  analysis.3  The 
synthetic  unity  of  apperception  is  the  unity  of  thought  which 
is  manifested  in  uniting  different  intuitions  into  one  object 
by  means  of  synthesis.4  The  analytic  unity  always  presupposes 
the  synthetic,  because  we  can  analyse  only  what  is  held  together 
before  the  mind.5  In  the  case  Kant  is  considering  the  analytic 

1  If  I  am  right — see  Chapter  XXI  §§  3-4 — consciousness  of  the 
act  of  synthesis  so  far  as  this  act  is  determined  by  the  nature  of  the 
given  matter  must  be  empirical  apperception.  Transcendental  apper- 
ception is  consciousness  of  the  universal  nature,  or  form,  present  in 
all  such  acts  of  synthesis,  and  this  Kant  seems  to  regard  as  conscious- 
ness of  one  pure  formal  act  of  synthesis  which  is  the  same  in  all 
synthesis — or  in  his  language  is  *  originally  one,  and  is  equivalent 
(gleichgeltend)  for  all  combination*;  see  B  130.  2  B  133. 

3  I  do  not  think  the  analytic  unity  of  apperception  has  anything 
to  do  with  the  analytic  judgement  *I  am  I*,  as  Caird  seems  to  imply; 
see  The  Critical  Philosophy  of  Kant,  Vol.  I,  pp.  399  ff.  It  is  primarily 
connected — according  to  the  note  on  B   133 — with  the  making  or 
thinking  of  concepts  by  analysis  of  given  intuitions  of  objects.  Perhaps 
Kant  may  have  regarded  it  as  present  also  in  analytic  judgements, 
which  are  made  by  analysis  of  concepts,  not  of  intuitions;  but  for 
this  I  have  seen  no  evidence. 

4  Both  analytic  and  synthetic  unity  are  present  in  every  judgement 
whereby  we  have  knowledge  of  objects;  see  A  79  =  B  104-5. 

6  The  synthetic  unity  does  not  presuppose  the  analytic  in  the 
same  way,  since  we  can  hold  the  manifold  together  in  an  'indistinct' 
or  'confused*  idea,  which  has  not  yet  received  the  analysis  it  requires.

5H     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §5 

unity  of  apperception  is  manifested  in  finding  the  common 
characteristic  of  being  'mine'  in  all  my  ideas,  or  in  finding  that 
all  these  ideas  belong  to  one  and  the  same  self.1  This  would 
be  impossible  unless  I  held  these  ideas  before  the  mind  in  one 
act  of  consciousness,  so  that  the  analytic  unity  of  apperception 
presupposes  the  synthetic.2 

It  should  be  emphasised  that  here,  as  in  the  first  edition, 
Kant  does  not  claim  that  synthesis  necessarily  takes  place 
in  the  full  light  of  consciousness.  I  may,  or  may  not,  be  aware 
of  the  act  of  synthesis.3  I  may,  or  may  not,  be  conscious  of  my 
ideas  as  mine.4  If  I  am  conscious  of  my  ideas  as  my  ideas,  this 
implies5  that  I  unite  (or  can  unite)  these  ideas  in  one  self- 
consciousness.  It  does  not,  however,  imply  consciousness 

1  This  is  what  Kant  calls  'representing  to  myself  the  identity  of 
consciousness  in  these  ideas'. 

2  To  take  a  more  modern  example — see   Broad,    The  Mind  and 
its  Place  in  Nature,  p.  606 — if  I  could  be  aware  by  analysis  that  the 
self  is  'a  numerically  identical  substantial  constituent  common  to  all 
our  successive  total  states',  this  would  depend  upon  the  fact  that  I 
could  hold  these  states  before  me  in  one  synthetic  act.  I  do  not  think 
that  this  truth  is  sufficiently  recognised  to-day. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  analytic  unity  of  apperception  is 
involved  (anhangi)  in  all  concepts  as  such.  In  thinking  of  'redness* 
for  example — to  take  the  simplest  of  concepts — I  recognise  by  an 
act  of  analysis  that  redness  is  a  characteristic  common  to  different 
intuitions  or  objects.  But  this  means  that  I  must  by  an  act  of  synthesis 
have  held  together  the  different  intuitions  found  in  this  red  apple 
(and  in  other  red  objects).  I  need  not  of  course,  once  I  have  acquired 
the  concept,  actually  see  a  red  apple,  if  I  am  to  think  of  redness: 
it  is  enough  that  I  combine  possible  representations.  Synthesis  is, 
however,  the  condition  of  that  analysis  which  is  involved  in  conception 
as  such,  and  so  in  judgement.  This  means  that  the  synthetic  unity 
of  apperception  is  the  ultimate  condition  of  all  knowledge,  including 
Logic  and  the  Transcendental  Philosophy. 

There  are  complications  in  this  doctrine  which  I  must  pass  over, 
and  some  of  Kant's  phrases  are  puzzling,  for  example  the  statement 
that  I  must  think  in  the  idea  'red'  the  analytic  unity  of  consciousness, 
which  makes  it  a  conceptus  communis ;  but  his  doctrine  is  clear  enough 
in  its  broad  lines,  and  I  suggest  that  it  is  also  true. 

3Bi3o.  *Bi32. 

5  Kant  says  that  these  two  thoughts  'mean'  the  same,  but  we  must 
not  suppose  that  they  are  the  same.  The  argument  implies  that  we 
can  have  one  without  the  other. 


XXVIII  §  5]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  515 

of  the  synthesis,  though  it  does  imply  the  possibility  of  the 
synthesis  (and  ultimately  the  possibility  of  consciousness  of 
the  synthesis). 

To  say  that  Kant  regarded  the  synthesis  involved  in  ap- 
perception as  either  necessarily  conscious  or  necessarily  un- 
conscious is  remote  from  the  truth.1 

Tfie  conclusion  of  the  whole  matter  is  that  the  synthetic 
unity  of  apperception  is  the  ground  of  the  necessary  synthetic 
unity 9 of  the  manifold,  and  vice  versa.  This  is  Kant's  way 
of  saying  that  neither  is  possible  apart  from  the  other;2  but 
it  is  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  which  is  ultimate 
or  'original',3  since  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  is  not  given 
in  or  through  the  objects.4  So  far  as  we  can  speak  of  it  as 
'given'5  at  all,  we  can  do  so  only  because  the  manifold  has 
been  synthetised  by  the  understanding.6 

Apperception,  as  a  power  or  faculty,  is  identical  with  under- 
standing.7 Understanding  is  a  power  of  a  priori  synthesis 
whereby  the  manifold  of  given  ideas  is  brought  under  the  unity 
of  apperception.8  This  is  to  say  that  understanding  is  a  power 

1  Compare  A  117  n. 

2  B  134.  Compare  A  105,  A  106-7. 

3  Unity  comes  from  apperception  alone,  though  this  unity  can  be 
manifested  only  in  the  synthesis  of  a  given  manifold. 

4  B  134.  Compare  B  130. 

5  I  see  no  need  to  change  the  reading  in  B  134,  where  it  is  said  to 
be  *  given'  a  priori.  Compare  B  143  and  §  n  of  this  chapter. 

6  B  130  at  the  end.  Given  ideas  may  be  either  concepts  or  intuitions, 
and  the  manifold  so  far  as  given  in  one  intuition  is  already  determined 
in  relation  to  a  form  of  judgement;  compare  B  143.  The  one  intuition 
must  be  an  object. 

7  B  134  n.  Kant  may  mean  that  the  unity  of  apperception  is  identical 
with  understanding,  since  A  119  supports  this  view.  I  have  avoided 
saying  so  above,  because  it  would  clash  so  obviously  with  the  sentence 
following. 

8  B  135.  Understanding  is  a  power  of  a  priori  synthesis,  since  in 
all  judgement  as  such  there  is  a  synthesis  which  is  one  and  the  same 
whatever  be  the  matter  combined;  compare  B   130.   All  empirical 
synthesis  (the  differences  between  which  depend  on  differences  in 
the  matter  given)  must  conform  to  the  a  priori  synthesis  without 
which  there  could  be  no  judgement  at  all.  Compare  Chapter  XXVII 


5i6    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §6 

of  judgement,1  and  it  implies  that  in  all  judgement  there  is 
an  a  priori  synthesis.2 

Kant  insists  further  that  the  manifold  to  be  synthetised  by 
human  understanding  must  be  given  to  sense.3  The  possibility 
of  an  understanding  for  which  this  is  not  so  need  not  be  con- 
sidered here.4 

§  6.  Apperception  and  Objects  of  Knowledge 

We  have  now  to  draw  the  obvious  conclusion  that  the 
synthetic  unity  of  apperception  (since  it  is  the  condition  of 
necessary  synthetic  unity  in  the  manifold  of  intuition)  is  the 
condition  of  knowledge  (or  experience)  of  objects.  If  so,  it 
must  be  the  condition  of  objects  themselves.5 

Kant  begins6  with  his  customary  introduction.  He  reasserts 
that  space  and  time  are  the  conditions  under  which  the  mani- 
fold is  given,  while  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  is  the 
condition  of  its  being  thought  or  known.7  Nothing  can  be 
thought  or  known  unless  it  is  capable  of  being  combined 
in  one  consciousness. 

Understanding  is  the  power  of  knowing,8  and  knowledge 
always  involves  a  determinate9  relation  of  our  ideas10  to  an 
object.  An  object  is  that  in  the  concept  of  which  the  manifold 

1  B  141.  Compare  A  126. 

2  All  this  supports  the  doctrine  considered  by  Vaihinger  and  Kemp 
Smith  so  impossible  in  A  104  fL,  and  also  the  doctrine  in  A  125. 

3  B  135.  4  See  Chapter  XXIX  §§  i  and  4. 
5  Compare  A  in  and  A  158  =  B  197.  6  B  136. 

7  That  is,  thought  or  known  as  an  object.  Compare  A  93  =  B  125-6. 

8  Kant  says  it  is  'the  power  of  cognitions'  (Erkenntnisse).  Unfortu- 
nately we  cannot  talk  of  'knowledges'  in  English,  and  even  to  talk 
of  'knowings'  is  difficult.  For  other  definitions  of  understanding 
see  A  126  and  Chapter  XXVII  §  i. 

9  The  word  'determinate'  is  difficult.  Compare  the  statement  in 
B  128-9.  To  determine  our  ideas  is  to  give  them  an  intellectual 
form,  and  so  to  bring  them  under  the  categories  and  make  them  ideas 
of  an  object.  See  also  A  266  =  B  322  ff.  Determination  may  take 
place  by  means  of  any  concept — see,  for  example,  the  concept  of 
'line'  in  B  137-8  and  compare  A  105 — but  the  categories  are  always 
presupposed.  10  Here  given  intuitions  or  appearances. 


XXVIII  §6]     THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  517 

of  a  given  intuition  is  united.1  Our  intuitions  must  be  united 
or  combined  or  synthetised,  if  they  are  to  be  intuitions  of  an 
object,  and  such  combination  or  synthesis  is  impossible  apart 
from  the  unity  of  apperception.  Hence  the  synthetic  unity 
of  apperception  is  the  condition  under  which  alone  ideas  can 
have; reference  to  an  object.  It  constitutes  the  objective  validity 
*of  ideas:  that  is  to  say,  through  it  alone  are  ideas  cognitions 
of  an  object. 

The  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  is  therefore  the  con- 
dition of  all  knowledge,  and  on  it  depends  the  possibility 
of  understanding  itself.2  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  principle 
of  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  is  the  supreme  principle 
of  all  employment  of  the  understanding.3 

Kant  emphasises  the  fact  that  his  argument  applies  to  all 
intuitions,  pure  as  well  as  empirical.  Every  intuition  must 
be  subject  to  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception  in  order 
to  be  an  object  for  me.4 

This  doctrine  is  familiar  to  us,  and  is  identical  with  the 
doctrine  of  the  first  edition. 

It  is  unfortunate  that  we  are  not  given  one  authoritative  and 
precise  formulation  for  the  ultimate  principle  of  the  synthetic 
unity  of  apperception.5  The  simplest  statement  is  that  'all  the 

1  B  137.  'United'  is  equivalent  to  'necessarily  united*.  Compare 
A  1 06,  'An  object  is  the  "something",  the  concept  of  which  expresses 
such  a  necessity  of  synthesis';  also  A  105,  'that  unity,  which  con- 
stitutes the  concept  of  an  object'.  This  is  confirmed  by  A  109.  In  the 
present  passage  Kant  does  not  use  the  term  *  transcendental  object', 
but  his  doctrine  has  not  changed. 

2B  137.  Here  the  unity  of  apperception  is  distinguished  from 
understanding,  not  identified  with  it  as  in  A  119  and  possibly  even 
in  B  134  n.  From  the  context  understanding  might  be  taken  as  the 
power  of  knowing — compare  A  97 — but  the  unity  of  apperception  is 
necessary  to  thought  as  such;  see  B  138. 

8  *A11  employment  of  the  understanding'  must  cover  thinking — as 
well  as  knowing;  compare  B  138  and  B  134  n.  For  this  distinction,  see 
B  146  and  compare  Chapter  II  §  4. 

4  B  138.  This  is  equivalent  to  'referring  or  relating  to  an  object' 
as  in  B  137  above. 

6  It  is  formulated  in  B  134-5,  in  B  136,  in  B  137,  and  again  in  B  138 
(in  the  last  passage  twice). 


5i8    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §  7 

manifold  of  intuition  stands  under  conditions1  of  the  original2 
synthetic  unity  of  apperception'.3 

As  so  formulated,  the  principle  does  not  look  like  an  analytic 
proposition,  but  Kant  asserts  twice  over  that  his  ultimate 
principle  is  an  analytic  proposition.4  To  bring  out  its  analytic 
character  he  formulates  it  as  follows:  'All  my  ideas  in  any 
given  intuition5  must  be  subject  to  that  condition  under  which 
alone  I  can  ascribe  them  as  my  ideas  to  one  and  the  same  self, 
and  under  which  therefore  I  can  grasp  or  comprehend  them, 
through  the  general  expression  "I  think",  as  synthetically 
combined  in  one  apperception'.6 

This  assertion  is  obviously  analytic,  so  far  as  it  affirms  that 
all  my  ideas  must  be  my  ideas.  It  nevertheless  makes  synthetic 
unity  the  condition  of  all  thought.7  The  implications  of  the 
principle  seem  to  go  far  beyond  any  merely  analytic  proposi- 
tion, and  to  presuppose  the  possibility  of  making  assertions 
about  human  knowledge  as  a  whole.8  The  proposition  can  be 
analytic  only  if  it  is  made  by  analysis  of  the  concept  of  human 
knowledge.9 

§  7.  The  Objective  Unity  of  Apperception 

Kant  has  been  arguing,  as  in  the  first  edition,  that  the 
transcendental  unity  of  apperception  is  the  ground  of  necessary 

1  The  plural,  as  usual,  must  refer  to  the  categories.  Compare  Am. 

2  The  German  is  'ursprunglich  synthetischeri*  (originally  synthetic). 
3Bi36.  4B  135,  B  138. 

6  Sometimes  for  Kant  intuitions  are  combined  into  ideas,  but  here 
ideas  seem  combined  into  one  intuition  (of  an  object).  6  B  138. 

7  B  138.  In  B  135  Kant  says  that  his  analytic  proposition  shows 
the  synthesis  of  the  manifold  to  be  necessary,  because  without  it 
identity  of  self-consciousness  could  not  be  thought. 

8  This  is  surely  implied  in  Kant's  statement  that  the  principle 
would  not  apply. to  an  understanding  possessed  of  intellectual  intuition. 
This  statement  is  in  both  cases  added  to  the  assertion  that  the  principle 
is  analytic.  See  B  135  and  B  138-9. 

9  For  'human  knowledge*  we  may  prefer  to  substitute   'human 
thought*  or  even  'human  understanding'.  In  B  135  the  proposition 
in  question  seems  to  be  a  definition  of  understanding  and  in  B  138 
to  be  a  definition  of  the  synthetic  unity  of  consciousness. 


XXVIII  §7]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  519 

synthetic  unity  in  the  given  manifold;  or  in  other  words  that 
through  the  unity  of  apperception  the  manifold  is  united  under 
the  concept  of  an  object.1 

One  difficulty  of  such  a  contention  is  this.  Even  if  we  admit 
that  an  object  is  nothing  more  than  a  particular  set  of  ideas 
conjoined  in  a  necessary  unity,  this  unity  cannot  be  due  to  the 
•unity  of  apperception ;  for  the  unity  of  apperception  is  surely 
present,  and  perhaps  must  be  present,  when  we  have  no  such 
necessary  unity,  and  consequently  when  we  have  no  object 
in  the  strict  sense.  Many  ideas  are  connected  in  our  mind,  and 
could  not  be  so  connected  unless  our  mind  were  one,  yet  we 
do  not  suppose  that  they  are  connected  in  the  object;  there 
is  no  objective  connexion  when  we  associate  black  cats  with 
good  luck,  or  when  we  suffer  from  toothache  while  listening 
to  an  orchestra. 

This  obvious  objection  Kant  attempts  to  meet  in  a  difficult 
passage,2  in  which  he  points  out  that  the  transcendental  unity 
of  apperception  is  an  objective  unity,  and  must  be  distinguished 
from  the  subjective  unity  of  consciousness,  described  also 
as  the  empirical  unity  of  apperception. 

The  subjective  unity  of  consciousness  is  not  to  be  found 
in  the  *I  think*  which  must  accompany  all  our  ideas  of  an 
object.  It  is  on  the  contrary  a  determination  of  inner  sense. 
Inner  sense  gives  me  a  series  of  intuitions,  and  the  order  in 
which  these  intuitions  come  to  me  depends  upon  circumstances 
or  upon  empirical  conditions.3  For  example,  ideas  may  be 
associated  in  my  mind  accidentally;  one  man  associates 
a  word  with  one  thing,  and  another  with  something  quite 
different.4  This  accidental  or  contingent5  connexion  of 

1  B  139.  Kant  says  'into  a  concept  of  the  object*.  2  B  139-40. 

8  It  is  not  clear  whether  Circumstances'  and  'empirical  conditions' 
are  meant  to  be  the  same  or  different.  Kant  mentions  only  'associa- 
tion* by  which  certain  ideas  happen  to  come  together  in  our  mind, 
but  I  believe  he  is  thinking  also  of  physical  stimuli  which  give  us 
now  one  intuition  and  now  another.  See  B  142  at  the  end. 

4  B  140.  Compare  A  101. 

5  The  'accidental'  or  'contingent'  (zufdllig)  does  not  exclude  neces- 
sity. The  contingent  is  that  which  is  necessary  under  a  condition. 
Everything  contingent  must  have  a  cause.  See  B  289-90. 


520    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVIII  §  7 

ideas  in  my  mind  is  what  Kant  calls  the  subjective  unity  of 
consciousness.1 

The  transcendental  unity  of  apperception,  on  the  other 
hand,  involves  more  than  a  mere  happening  to  combine  different 
ideas  in  imagination.2  It  involves  an  *I  think',  and  to  think 
is  to  think  an  objective  connexion  which  does  not  depend 
on  my  subjective  states.3  This  is  why  the  transcendental'unity 
of  apperception  is  said  to  be  objective,4  and  again  to  be  objec- 
tively valid.5 

The  transcendental  unity  of  apperception  is  'original', 
while  the  empirical  unity  of  apperception  is  'derivative';  the 
empirical  unity  is  derived  from  the  transcendental  under  given 
conditions  in  concrete. 

The  meaning  of  this  last  assertion  is  not  clearly  explained. 
I  believe  that  Kant's  doctrine  is  roughly  this:  through  the 
necessary  relation  of  time  (and  all  that  is  in  time)  to  the  trans- 
cendental unity  of  apperception,  the  order  in  which  our  ideas 
come  to  us — whether  because  of  external  stimuli  or  subjective 
association — is  determined  by  causal  law.  It  is  in  this  sense 
that  the  subjective  connexion  of  ideas  in  our  minds  is  derived 
from,  or  conditioned  by,  the  original  synthetic  unity  of  apper- 
ception.6 

1  The  fact  that  he  calls  it  also  'the  empirical  unity  of  apperception' 
supports  the  doctrine  that  empirical  apperception  is   consciousness 
of   what    I   suffer,   that  is,   of    my    mental    states,    whereas    pure 
apperception  is  consciousness  of  my  act  of  thinking.   See  Chapter 
XXI  §  2. 

2  I  use  'imagination*  to  cover  not  only  reproductive  imagination 
(which  Kant  clearly  has  in  view),  but  also  the  imagination  which  is 
present  in  'apprehension'  or  'sense-perception'.   If  we  hear  music 
and  feel  toothache  at  the  same  time,  this  is  a  subjective  and  accidental 
connexion,  as  is  also  the  fact  that  we  happen  to  see  the  front  of  a 
house  before  we  see  the  back,  although  these  coexist  in  the  object. 

8  6142.  4Bi3Q.  6Bi40. 

8  This  difficult  doctrine  is,  I  think,  present  also  in  the  Analogies, 
and  Kant  tries  to  work  it  out  in  detail  in  the  Opus  Postumum.  It  is 
connected  with  what  Adickes  calls  Kant's  doctrine  of  'double  affection'. 
In  any  case  it  should  be  clear  that  if  we  make  our  own  mental  history 
an  object  to  ourselves,  its  unity,  like  that  of  any  other  object,  must 
depend  on  the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception. 


XXVIII  §8]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  521 

It  should  be  added — though  Kant  is  not  too  clear  on  this 
side  of  his  doctrine1 — that  I  can  judge  my  own  subjective 
states.  When  I  do  so  I  make  them  an  object,  and  affirm  an 
objective  connexion.  The  fact  that  I  associate  a  word  with 
a  particular  thing  is  an  objective  event  in  time,  and  it  is  causally 
determined  by  other  events,  some  of  which  are  physical.  These 
'causal  connexions  are,  however,  all  dependent,  according  to 
Kant,  upon  the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception. 

The  essential  point  of  §  18  is  this:  that  the  transcendental 
unity  of  apperception  is  an  objective  unity,  inasmuch  as  it  is 
the  source  of  unity  in  objects.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  it  is 
the  necessary  unity  of  thinking,2  and  not  merely  a  unity  of 
what  we  may,  perhaps  not  illegitimately,  call  imagination.3 

§  8.  Apperception  and  the  Form  of  Judgement 

The  next  step  which  Kant  takes  is  obvious.  The  synthesis 
of  the  manifold  under  the  unity  of  apperception,  a  synthesis 
which  is  necessary  if  we  are  to  have  knowledge  of  objects, 
takes  place  by  means  of  judgement.  To  say  this  is  merely 
to  expand  the  statement  that  the  synthesis  of  which  we  speak 
is  due  to  the  understanding. 

The  subsection4  which  establishes  this  point  is  concerned 
with  the  logical  form  of  all5  judgements,  according  to  Kant's 
own  heading.  As  such,  it  belongs  to  Formal  Logic,  and  attempts 
to  connect  the  Transcendental  Deduction  with  what  has 
already  been  said  in  Section  i  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction.6 

1  His  doctrine  of  judgements  of  perception  in  the  Prolegomena 
§  1 8  (IV  298)  seems  to  be  incompatible  with  this  view. 

2  A  unity  in  thinking  which  is  impossible  apart  from  unity  in  what 
is  thought  or  known.  This  unity  in  thinking  is  not  conditioned,  but 
ultimate  or  original. 

8  Kant  himself  supports  such  a  use  in  B  141,  where  he  speaks  of 
reproductive  imagination,  but  I  think  that  his  view  covers  also  Appre- 
hension', which  is  the  work  of  imagination.  Compare  B  142.  We 
might  also  put  the  distinction  as  one  between  the  unity  of  thought 
or  experience  as  such  and  the  unity  which  belongs  to  the  individual's 
thought  or  experience  merely  as  the  thought  or  experience  of  this 
individual.  4§  19.

522     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION    [XXVIII  §  8 

It  should  be  compared  with  the  discussion  of  judgement 
in  Kant's  own  lectures  on  Formal  Logic.1 

Kant  refuses  to  define  judgement  as  the  representation  of  a 
relation  between  two  concepts?  Such  a  definition  has  two  faults. 
It  refers  only  to  categorical  judgements,  and  it  fails  to  indi- 
cate the  nature  of  the  relation.  Ideas  may  be  related  by , mere 
association  in  my  mind,  and  this  is  certainly  not  judgement. 

The  first  fault  Kant  corrects  by  substituting  'cognitions' 
or  'knowledges'  3  for  'concepts'.  This  is  a  general  word  -which 
covers  both  concepts  and  judgements.  According  to  Kant, 
hypothetical  and  disjunctive  judgements  assert  a  relation,  not 
of  concepts,  but  of  judgements. 

The  second  fault  Kant  corrects  by  insisting  that  the  relation 
asserted  in  judgement  is  an  objective  relation.  Judgement  is 
the  way4  of  bringing  given  cognitions  to  the  objective  unity 
of  apperception.5 

When  I  say  'The  body  is  heavy',  I  am  not  saying  merely 
that  two  ideas  are  associated  in  my  mind,  or  have  been  fre- 
quently given  together  in  intuition.6  I  am  saying  that  they  are 
connected  in  the  object,  no  matter  what  the  state  of  my  mind 
may  be.  The  copula  'is'  is  intended  to  distinguish  the  ob- 
jective unity  of  ideas  from  the  subjective.7 

1Log.$  17-40  (IX  ioi  ff.). 

2  This  is  the  view  of  G.  F.  Meier  and  Baumgarten,  except  that 
Meier  speaks  of  a  logical'  relation,  and  Baumgarten  speaks  of  'a 
relation  of  concepts  as  agreeing  or  disagreeing  with  one  another*. 
These  additions  go  some  way  to  meet  Kant's  objection. 

3  'Erkenntnisse.'  I  recognise  the  difficulty  of  finding  a  good  English 
translation  for  this  word,  but  Kemp  Smith's  'modes  of  knowledge* 
seems  to  me  even  more  than  usually  misleading  in  the  present 
connexion. 

4  'Art.'  I  think  it  would  be  better  to  say  'act'.  Compare  B  143. 

6  B  141.  Compare  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  475  n.):  'Judgement  is  an 
act  through  which  given  ideas  first  become  cognitions  of  an  object'. 
Compare  also  Log.  §  17  (IX  ioi). 

6  This  shows  clearly  that  under  the  empirical  unity  of  consciousness 
Kant  includes  ideas  given  together  to  sense,  as  well  as  ideas  joined 
together  by  association. 

7  This  applies  only  to  categorical  judgements,  whose  form  is  the 
copula.  See  Log.  §  24  (IX  105).  The  form  of  hypothetical  judgements 


XXVIII  §  9]      THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  523 

The  objective  unity  of  ideas  is  the  unity  of  ideas  in  an  object. 
This  unity  involves  necessity,  but  it  must  not  be  thought  that 
the  necessity  is  to  be  found  in  the  ideas  themselves  as  these 
are  given  to  empirical  intuition.  The  necessity  is  imposed 
upon  them  by  the  nature  of  thought.  Such  ideas  belong  to  one 
another,  not  in  themselves,  but  'in  virtue  of  the  necessary 
unity  of  apperception  in  the  synthesis  of  intuitions'.1 

This  in  turn  implies  that  such  ideas  belong  to  one  another, 
or  arQ  combined  with  one  another,  in  accordance  with  certain 
principles  which  are  necessary  for  knowledge  of  objects. 
These  principles  are  derived  from  the  unity  of  apperception. 
Since  apperception  is  understanding,  and  understanding  is  the 
power  or  faculty  of  judgement,  these  principles  are  based 
on  the  forms  of  judgement,  the  ways  in  which  given  ideas  are 
necessarily  combined  by  thought.  This  is  made  explicit  in  the 
following  subsection. 

It  should  be  noted  that  Kant  is  assuming  throughout  that 
judgement  imposes  objective  unity,  not  only  upon  the  cog- 
nitions (concepts  or  judgements)  combined  in  judgement,  but 
also  upon  the  intuitions  to  which  these  cognitions  refer.2 

§  9.  The  Objective  Deduction 

All  that  remains  for  Kant  to  do  is  to  gather  together  the 
main  points  of  the  previous  argument,  to  explain  how  the 
principles3  derived  from  the  unity  of  apperception  are  bound 
up  with  the  forms  of  judgement  and  the  categories,  and  to 
draw  the  conclusion  that  the  categories  have  objective  validity. 

This  Kant  does  in  a  passage  which  he  himself  describes4 

is  the  sequence  or  consequence  (Konsequenz) ;  the  form  of  disjunctive 
judgements  is  the  disjunction  itself.  See  Log.  §§  25  and  28  (IX  105 
and  1 06). 

1  It  should  be  observed  that,  just  as  in  the  first  edition,  this  necessity 
is  present  in  empirical  judgements  which  employ  empirical  concepts. 

2  Compare  B  143  where  this  is  stated  explicitly.  He  must  have  in 
mind  the  synthetic  unity  imposed — according  to  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction — upon  intuitions,  and  not  merely  the  analytic  unity  which 
is  recognised  by  Formal  Logic  in  its  account  of  conception.

524    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXVIII  §  9 

as  the  Transcendental  Deduction.1  I  have  called  it  the  'Objec- 
tive Deduction1  because  it  is  the  Transcendental  Deduction 
on  its  objective  side.2 

We  saw  in  §  17  of  the  Kritik?  that  the  manifold  of  every 
intuition  must  be  subject  to  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception, 
because  only  so  can  the  intuition  have  that  unity  which  is 
necessary  for  it  to  be  an  intuition  of  an  object.  We  saw  in  §  19*' 
that  judgement  is  the  act5  whereby  the  manifold  of  all  given  ideas 
(whether  intuitions  or  concepts)  is  brought  under  the  unity  of 
apperception.6  Hence  all  the  manifold,  so  far  as  it  is  given  in 
one  intuition,7  is  determined  by  judgement,8  and  therefore  is 
determined  in  relation  to  one  of  the  forms  of  judgement. 

The  categories  are  the  forms  of  judgement,  so  far  as  the 
manifold  is  determined  in  relation  to  these  forms.9  Therefore 
the  manifold  of  given  intuition  must  be  subject  to  the  cate- 
gories,10 if  the  intuition  is  to  have  that  unity  which  is  necessary 
for  it  to  be  intuition  of  an  object. 

In  other  words,  the  categories  necessarily  apply  to  all  objects 
given  to  sensuous  intuition.  They  are,  in  short,  objectively 


1  §  20.  Kant  includes  §21  also  in  the  Transcendental  Deduction, 
but  §21  is  a  restatement  of  the  conclusion,  and  a  review  of  the  argu- 
ment as  a  whole. 

2  The  Transcendental  Deduction  on  its  subjective  side  is  to  be 
found  in  §  26,  which  also  Kant  entitles  the  'Transcendental  Deduction*. 

3  §  6  of  this  chapter. 

4  §  8  of  this  chapter. 

6  Kant  says  that  the  act  is  the  function  of  judgement.  This  is  a 
loose  use  of  terms,  since  the  function  (or  form)  of  judgement  is  not 
the  act,  but  the  unity  of  the  act  of  judgement.  See  A  68  =  B  93. 

6  That  is,  under  the  unity  of  apperception  which  is  described  as 
synthetic,  objective,  original,  and  transcendental. 

7  Kant  says  empirical  intuition,  but  his  argument  covers  (in  some 
sense)  all  intuitions  (empirical  and  pure).  See  B  137-8. 

8  Or  by  the  general  function  or  form  of  judgement.  Kant  as  usual 
passes  from  the  function  to  the  functions,  and  from  the  form  to  the 
forms,  of  judgement.  See  A  70  =  B  95. 

9  B  143.  Compare  B  128  and  M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  474  n.). 

10  This  assumes  that  what  is  determined  in  relation  to  one  form 
of  judgement  is  necessarily  capable  of  being  determined  in  relation 
to  all  forms  of  judgement. 


XXVIII  §  IQ]    THE  OBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  525 

valid.  This  is  what  the  Transcendental  Deduction  was  required 
to  prove.1 

§  10.  Ambiguity  of  the  Word  'Given' 

There  may  seem  to  be  inconsistency  in  the  statement  that 
the  manifold,  so  far  as  it  is  given  in  one  intuition,  is  determined 
in  relation  to  a  form  of  judgement.  Elsewhere2  intuition  is  said 
to  be  given  independently  of  thought  and  its  forms. 

The  inconsistency  is,  I  think,  merely  verbal.  The  word 
'given'  can  be  used  as  a  relative  term.  Any  idea,  whether 
intuition  or  concept,  can  be  'given'  in  relation  to  further 
processes  of  thought.3  Thus  from  the  point  of  view  of  Formal 
Logic  the  cognitions  (concepts  or  judgements)  combined  in 
judgement  are  taken  as  given.4  Formal  Logic  always  takes 
cognitions  as  given,  for  it  makes  no  enquiry  into  their  origin.5 

An  intuition  given  independently  of  thought  is  given  in  the 
strictest  sense,  and  is  a  mere  multiplicity  without  unity.6 
An  intuition  which  is  given  as  a  unity  is  given  only  in  a  relative 
sense,  and  it  is  so  given,  as  Kant  says  expressly,  only  because 
it  has  been  united  by  thought.7 

This  does  not  mean  that  intuition  is  first  given  and  then 
thought.  It  means  that  if  we  abstract  from  the  element  of 
thought,  we  find  a  mere  manifold  without  unity.  Synthesis 
is  necessary  for  the  unity  of  an  intuition,  whether  the  intuition 
be  empirical  or  pure.8 

1  A  XVI,  A  85  =  B  1  17,  A  89  =  B  122.  Note  Kant's  clear  summary 
of  the  Deduction  in  the  first  sentence  of  B  144  and  the  footnote. 

2  E.g.  A  89  =  B  122,  B  132,  B  145. 


4  See  the  definition  of  judgement  in  B  141. 

6  A  56  =  B  80.  In  Log.  §  4  Kant  speaks  of  empirical  concepts  and 
even  of  notions  (categories)  as  given,  the  first  a  posteriori,  the  second 
a  priori. 

6  If  we  abstract  still  further,  and  consider  it  as  contained  in  a 
moment  of  time,  it  would  seem  to  be  absolute  unity  without  multi- 
plicity. See  A  99  and  compare  Chapter  XIX  §  i  .

in  B  144  n.   In  B  161  unity  of  synthesis  is  said  to  be  given  along 
with  (although  not  in)  intuitions.  8  B  136  n.,  B  137-8. 


CHAPTER    XXIX 
THE    SUBJECTIVE    DEDUCTION 

§  i .  The  Categories  and  Human  Experience 

The  Objective  Deduction  has,  Kant  believes,  demonstrated 
the  objective  validity  of  the  pure  categories  for  every  intelligent 
finite  being.  Intelligent  finite  beings  are  only  parts  of  a  wider 
universe,  and  their  thinking  does  not  make  the  world  which 
they  have  to  know.  All  finite  thinking,  so  far  as  it  is  about 
something  other  than  itself,  must  have  objects  given  to  it 
from  without ;  and  so  far  as  objects  are  merely  given,  they  are 
given  to  a  passive  capacity  for  receiving  impressions.  Such 
a  passive  capacity  Kant  calls  sensibility,  and  of  such  sensibility 
our  human  sensibility  is  an  example,  the  only  example  with 
which  we  are  acquainted.  Other  kinds  of  sensibility  might 
receive  altogether  different  impressions,  and  might  not  be 
subject  to  the  forms  of  space  and  time.  The  pure  categories 
would  nevertheless  be  applicable  to  an  experience  which 
depended  upon  any  kind  of  sensibility,  since  (i)  intuitions1 
given  to  passive  sensibility  could  never,  apart  from  thinking, 
possess  unity,2  and  so  could  never  be  intuitions  of  an  object, 
and  (2)  thinking  must  always  have  the  same  forms,3  and  must 
therefore  use  the  same  categories. 

On  this  view  the  pure  categories  are  not  limited  to  human 
experience,  as  are  the  forms  of  time  and  space.4  Hence  so  far 

1  It  is  important  to  note  that  Kant  everywhere  (not  merely  in  the 
second  edition)  opposes  intuitions  in  general  to  human  intuitions,  to 
our  sensuous  intuitions,  objects  of  our  senses  and  so  on. 

a  The  plausibility  of  this  is  greater  when  sensibility  receives 
intuitions  successively. 

3  Kant  has  been  criticised  for  assuming   this,  but  it  is  difficult  to 
understand   how   an   activity  with   quite   different  forms   could   be 
called  thinking  at  all.  Nevertheless  for  the  sake  of  completeness  Kant 
should  at  least  have  raised  the   question  whether  there  could  be 
thinking  with  different  forms. 

4  Even  time  and  space  need  not  be  so  limited,  but  we  cannot  say 
that  they  must  be  forms  of  all  sensibility. 


XXIX  §  i]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  527 

as  thought  is  concerned,  the  categories  are  not  limited  to 
human  intuitions  given  under  the  forms  of  time  and  space, 
but  have  an  unlimited  field.1  These  wider  possibilities  have, 
however,  no  meaning  for  us.  For  us  the  categories  are  quite 
empty,  they  are  mere  forms  of  thought  giving  us  no  knowledge 
of  objects,  unless  they  are  applied  to  a  manifold  given  in  time 
and  %pace. 

Kant  is  careful  to  explain  that  for  an  infinite  intelligence 
having  no  reality  beyond  itself  the  categories  would  play  no 
part.  They  are  required  only  for  an  intelligence  whose  objects 
are  given  to  sensibility  from  without.  In  an  infinite  intelligence 
there  would  not  be  this  divorce  between  thought  and  intuition. 
Its  intuitions  would  be  intellectual,  not  sensuous;  and  its 
understanding  would  be  intuitive,  not  discursive. 

These  speculations  are  introduced  by  Kant  primarily  in  the 
interests  of  his  moral  philosophy.2  They  are  much  more 
prominent  in  the  second  edition,3  but  they  are  found  also  in 
the  first  edition.4  For  our  present  purposes  the  importance  of 
such  doctrines  is  this — that  the  categories  can  give  us  knowledge 
only  if  they  are  related  to  the  manifold  of  intuition  through 
the  forms  of  space  and  time.  In  other  words,  the  categories 
do  not  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects,  except  in  so  far 
as  they  are  schematised. 

If  we  are  to  show  how  the  pure  categories  involved  in  all 
thinking  qud  thinking5  are  to  give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of 
objects,  we  must  explain  their  relation  to  the  form  of  time  and 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination.  This  is  the  question 
which  belongs  to  the  Subjective  Deduction,  and  apart  from 
this  the  Objective  Deduction  is  manifestly  incomplete.6 

1  B  1 66  n.  Compare  B  148.  This  is  the  doctrine  condemned  by 
Vaihinger  as  pre-Critical  in  A  88  =  B  120.  2  See  B  166  n. 

3  E.g.  B  72,  B  135,  B  138-9,  B  145,  B  149,  B  153,  B  157,  B  159,  B  308. 

4  E.g.  A  35  =  B  52,  A  252,  A  256  =  B  311-12. 

5  An  intuitive  understanding  would  not  think,  it  would  know ;  for 
in  it  there  would  be  no  separation  between  conception  and  intuition. 

6  B  144.  This  suggests  that  what  I  have  called  the  Objective  and 
Subjective  Deductions  in  the  second  edition  differ  from  the  Objective 
and  Subjective  Deductions  described  in  the  first  edition,  for  there 


528      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXIX  §  2 

§2.  The  Objective  and  Subjective  Deductions 

Kant  explains  the  distinction  between  the  two  halves  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction  in  a  passage  of  unusual  clarity.1 

In  the  Objective  Deduction,  he  points  out,  it  is  assumed 
only  that  finite  thinking  must  have  a  manifold  given  to  it  in 
intuition  prior  to  thought  and  independently  of  thought.2 
This  manifold  (the  manifold  of  an  intuition  in  general*)  must 
have  unity  if  there  is  to  be  intuition  of  an  object  ;4  it  must  be 
synthetised  by  the  understanding,  and  so  brought  unddr  the 
unity  of  apperception  and  the  pure  categories.5 

In  all  this  no  account  is  taken  of  the  way6  in  which  the 
manifold  must  be  given;  that  is  to  say,  no  account  is  taken 
of  the  form  of  human  intuition.7  We  have  still  to  show  how 
the  unity  of  the  manifold  of  an  intuition  in  general,  a  unity 
thought  in  the  pure  categories,  can  be  identical  with  the  unity 
of  our  empirical  intuitions  given  under  the  form  of  time.8 

the  Objective  Deduction  was  said  to  be  alone  essential  to  his  purpose ; 
see  A  XVI-XVII.  One  might  suppose  that  in  the  first  edition  time 
belonged  to  the  Objective  Deduction,  while  imagination  belonged  to 
the  Subjective  Deduction.  This  is  not,  however,  borne  out  by  the 
passage  in  A  92-3  =  B  124-6  (which  is  mentioned  in  A  XVII  as 
sufficient  by  itself  on  the  objective  side  of  the  Deduction);  for  the 
argument  there  does  not  depend  on  time.  It  seems  to  me  that  a 
division  which  was  a  little  uncertain  in  the  first  edition  becomes 
clear  and  definite  in  the  second. 

Although  it  is  convenient  to  speak,  as  Kant  does,  about  a  Subjective 
and  an  Objective  Deduction,  we  must  not  forget  that  this  is  only  a 
way  of  referring  to  the  subjective  and  objective  sides  of  one  Transcen- 
dental Deduction.

I  believe,  to  show  that  it  does  not  include  intellectual  intuition.

8  The  second  unity  is  simply  the  first  unity  applied  to  our  sensuous 
intuitions;  see  B  161.  Since  our  intuitions  are  given  independently 
of  thought  and  its  categories,  we  have  to  show  how  the  principles 
of  synthesis  necessarily  involved  in  judgement  as  such  can  determine 


XXIX  §  3]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  529 

Kant  will  argue  that  because  our  empirical  intuitions  are  given 
to  us  under  the  form  of  time,  they  must  be  subject  to  a  trans- 
cendental synthesis  of  imagination  which  imposes  on  them 
unity  in  accordance  with  the  categories.1 

Only  in  this  way  can  we  explain  how  the  categories  apply 
a  priori  to  objects  of  our  human  senses,  and  this  is  necessary 
jn  order  to  complete  the  Transcendental  Deduction.  Our  proof 
that  the  categories  must  apply  to  objects  of  intuition  in  general 
is  only  the  beginning,  or  the  first  stage,  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction.2  We  know  that  our  intuitions,  like  all  others,  must 
conform  to  the  categories,  if  they  are  to  be  intuitions  of  an 
object;  but  we  have  still  to  understand  how  they  do  so. 3 

§  3.  Framework  of  the  Subjective  Deduction 

In  the  Subjective  Deduction  the  most  important  passages 
are  the  beginning  of  §  24  and  the  whole  of  §  26. 

The  two  introductory  subsections  show  that  for  us  the 
categories  apply  only  to  objects  of  experience — that  is,  to 
objects  given  in  empirical  intuition  under  the  forms  of  time 
and  space — and  not  to  things-in-themselves  (§§  22-3). 

Kant  then  proceeds  to  the  subjective  side  of  the  Deduction . 
Because  time  and  space  are  the  pure  forms  of  human  intuition, 
there  is  possible  a  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
which  determines  the  given  manifold  in  accordance  with  the 
unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories  (§  24)4. 

the  combination  of  our  intuitions :  we  know  only  that  they  must  do 
so,  if  we  are  to  have  knowledge  of  objects. 

1  This  subjective  side  of  the  Deduction  is  a  necessary  preparation 
for  the  Schematism  of  the  Categories. 

2  In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  subjective  side  of  the  Deduction 
has  been  completely  ignored  in  the  second  edition,  the  surprise  of 
some  commentators  at  this  statement  is  a  little  difficult  to  understand ; 
see  for  example  Ewing,  Kant's  Treatment  of  Causality,  p.  61,  and 
Kemp  Smith,  Commentary,  p.  289. 

8  We  understand  this  only  because  they  are  given  in  time.  In 
M.A.d.N.  Vor.  (IV  474  n.  ff.)  a  similar  distinction  is  made  between 
'that'  and  'how',  but  time  (curiously  enough)  is  brought  under  the 
'that',  while  the  'how'  does  not  even  bring  in  imagination,  but  argues 
direct  from  the  nature  of  judgement.  This  suggests  that  the  distinction 
of  'that'  and  'how'  was  not  clear  in  Kant's  mind.  4  B  150-2. 


530     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION       [XXIX  §  4 

This  is  followed  by  an  account  of  the  unity  of  apperception 
in  relation  to  inner  sense  and  the  form  of  time  (§§  24-5).1 

The  essence  of  the  Subjective  Deduction  is  to  be  found 
in  §  26.  There  Kant  attempts  to  show  how  our  human  intuitions 
must  fall  under  the  categories  if  we  are  to  know  objects  in  one 
common  space  and  time.  He  illustrates  his  contention  by 
examples  falling  under  the  categories  of  quantity  and  causality; 
Finally  he  discusses  the  relation  between  the  a  priori  laws  or 
principles  governing  the  whole  of  nature  and  the  particular 
(or  special)  empirical  laws  which  we  discover  by  observation 
and  experiment. 

The  last  subsection2  gives  us  a  general  review  of  the  whole 
argument. 

§  4.  Limits  of  Knowledge  Through  the  Categories 

For  knowledge  (as  opposed  to  thought)  we  require  (i) 
intuition  and  (2)  a  concept  or  category.3  If  no  intuition  is 
given  corresponding  to  our  concept,  we  are  left  with  only 
a  form  of  thought  which  thinks  nothing  real. 

Since  human  beings  have  no  intellectual,  but  only  sensuous, 
intuitions,  they  can  have  knowledge  only  when  the  categories 
are  applied  to  sensuous  intuitions. 

Human  intuitions  are  either  empirical  or  pure,  and  it  might 
seem  thatanobject  might  be  given  in  pure,  as  well  as  in  empirical, 
intuition.  In  a  sense  this  is  true.  In  mathematics  we  can  apply 
the  categories  to  pure  intuitions,4  and  so  obtain  a  priori  know- 
ledge of  objects.6  Such  mathematical  knowledge  is,  however, 

1  B  152-9.  This  I  propose  to  reserve  for  discussion  later,  as  it  does 
not  seem  essential  to  the  argument;  see  Chapters  LII-LIII.  2§  27. 

3  B  146.  We  may  use  other  concepts  also,  but  whether  we  do  so 
or  not,  we  must  always  use  a  category,  if  we  are  to  know  an  object. 

4  This  seems  to  be   Kant's  meaning,  though  the  only  category 
which  we  obviously  apply  in  pure  mathematics  is  the  category  of 
quantity  (and  perhaps  the  category  of  possibility).  Kant  mentions- 
categories  in  the  plural  a  little  lower  down  in  B  147. 

6 They  are  objects  only  by  courtesy:  objects  strictly  are  concrete 
things,  and  Kant  here  uses  the  word  'thing'  to  distinguish  real  objects 
from  the  pseudo-objects  of  mathematics. 


XXIX  §5]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  531 

knowledge  of  the  forms  of  objects,  rather  than  of  objects 
themselves.  It  can  be  considered  knowledge  of  objects,  only 
if  we  assume  that  objects  are  given  to  our  senses  in  space  and 
time  and  must  therefore  possess  the  spatial  and  temporal 
characteristics  which  we  study  in  mathematics.1 

Strictly  speaking,  therefore,  the  categories  give  us  knowledge 
only  if  they  are  applied  to  empirical  intuition.  Hence  although 
by  means  of  the  categories  we  possess  a  priori  knowledge,  this 
knowledge  tells  us  only  what  an  object  must  be,  if  it  is  an 
object  of  possible  experience.  Experience  itself  is  empirical 
knowledge,  that  is,  knowledge  of  objects  given  to  empirical 
intuition.2 

On  this  principle  a  limit  is  set  to  the  application  of  the 
categories,  just  as  a  limit  was  set  in  the  Aesthetic  to  the  appli- 
cation of  space  and  time.3 

§  5.  The  Categories  and  Non-human  Intelligence 

The  limits  of  the  application  of  the  pure  categories  are 
theoretically  wider  than  those  of  space  and  time ;  for  the  pure 
categories  must  play  their  part  in  the  experience  of  any  finite 
intelligence  dependent  on  any  kind  of  sensibility,  while  space 
and  time  need  not  extend  beyond  human  experience.4 

This  is  a  purely  speculative  possibility  which  we  can  afford 
to  ignore.  For  us  the  categories  have  sense5  and  significance, 
only  in  so  far  as  objects  are  given  to  our  senses  under  the  forms 
of  space  and  time.  We  are  incapable  of  attaching  any  real 
meaning  to  the  idea  of  objects  given  to  another  kind  of  sense 
under  another  form  of  sensibility,  nor  can  we  understand — 

1  Compare  also  A  239-40  —  B  299. 

2  Compare    B   218:   'Experience   is   empirical  knowledge,  that  is, 
knowledge  which  determines  an  object  through  sense-perception*. 

3  B  148. 

•  4  In  B  148  Kant  assumes  that  space  and  time  would  not  do  so, 
but  in  B  72  he  recognises  that  this  is  not  necessarily  true. 

6  There  is  perhaps  a  play  upon  words  in  this  double  use  of  'sense* 
(Sinn),  which  Kemp  Smith's  translation  'body'  fails  to  bring  out.

532       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §  6 

except  by  analogy — how  the  pure  categories  could  apply  to 
such  objects. 

If  we  consider  the  still  more  remote  possibility  of  an 
intelligence  possessed  of  intellectual  intuition,  we  can  say  that 
no  spatial  or  temporal  predicate  could  apply  to  the  objects 
of  its  knowledge.1  Such  negative  characterisation  gives  us  no 
positive  knowledge  of  these  objects.  Furthermore,  the  categories 
themselves,  even  in  their  pure  form,  could  not  be  applied  to 
such  objects ;  for  even  if  we  think  such  an  object  by  means  of 
the  categories,  we  cannot  in  the  absence  of  empirical  intuition 
know  that  there  is  anything  which  can  correspond  to  our 
thought.2 

§  6.  The  Categories  and  the  Form  of  Time 

We  now  approach3  the  special  problem  of  the  Subjective 
Deduction. 

The  categories  whose  objective  validity  has  been  demon- 
strated are  the  pure  categories,  mere  forms  of  thought  (or  of 
judgement)  involved  necessarily  in  the  nature  of  understanding 
itself,  and  called  for  this  reason  pure  concepts  of  the  under- 
standing. They  differ  from  forms  of  thought  only  in  this,  that 
the  forms  of  thought  treated  in  Formal  Logic  are  considered 

1  The  reason  for  this  is  that  space  and  time  are  essentially  bound 
up  with  sense. 

2  Kant,  I  think,  believes  that  the  object  of  intellectual  intuition 
would  be  the  thing-in-itself.  His  view  is  always  that  since  we  can 
think  only  by  means   of  the   categories,   we   can   think  things-in- 
themselves  only  by  means  of  the   categories,  but  in  the  absence   of 
intuition  such  thinking  is  not  knowledge.  We  must,  for  example, 
think  of  a  thing-in-itself  under  the  category  of  substance,  and  therefore 
as  something  which  can  exist  as  a  subject,  but  never  as  a  mere  predicate. 
But  once  we  exclude  all  temporal  and  spatial  reference  from  the  cate- 
gory, it  becomes  meaningless — in  the  sense  that  we  have  no  idea 
whether  there  could  be  an  object  corresponding  to  this  thought.  The 
category  of  substance  gives  us  knowledge  of  objects  only  when  it  is 
applied  to  the  permanent  in  space  and  time,  that  is,  to  things  as  they 
must  appear  to  us,  not  as  they  are  in  themselves.  See  also  Chapter  II 
§  4  and  Chapters  LIV-LVI. 

3§  24.  Kant's  heading  for  this  subsection  is  'The  application  of 
the  categories  to  objects  of  the  senses  in  general'.  This  is  misleading 
unless  'the  senses  in  general'  can  be  taken  to  mean  'human  senses'. 


XXIX  §  6]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  533 

simply  as  forms  of  thought,  whereas  the  categories  are  forms 
of  thought  considered  as  determining  an  object  given  to  some 
sort  of  sensuous  intuition.1  As  such  the  pure  categories  are 
concepts  of  an  object  in  general,  and  through  them  no  deter- 
minate object  is  thought.2 

To  say  this  is,  according  to  Kant,  to  say  that  they  are 
concepts  of  the  synthesis  which  is  necessarily  involved  in 
knowing  any  and  every  object  given  to  any  kind  of  sensuous 
intuitjpn.  This  synthesis  is  the  synthesis  which  is  present  in 
the  form  (or  forms)  of  judgement.  As  such  it  is  purely  intel- 
tectual,  and  wholly  independent  of  the  nature  of  the  matter 
judged.  It  is  transcendental,  since  (i)  it  has  its  origin  in  the 
nature  of  understanding  itself,  and  (2)  it  is  the  source  of 
a  priori  knowledge,  namely  of  that  a  priori  knowledge  which 
is  due  to  the  understanding.3 

What  Kant  has  now  to  explain  is  how  the  manifold  given 
to  human  intuition  must  conform  to  these  intellectual  syntheses 
involved  in  the  very  nature  of  thought.  The  difficulty  of  the 
Deduction  depends  on  the  relative  independence  of  thought 
and  intuition,  such  that  intuitions  are  given  to  us  independently 
of  thought,  and  thought  has  its  own  forms  which  have  nothing 
to  do  with  the  nature  of  what  is  given  to  us  in  intuition.4 

We  have  already  seen  that  intuitions  cannot  be  intuitions 
of  an  object,  unless  they  conform  to  the  pure  categories. 
We  have  now  to  explain  how  they  must  conform  to  the  cate- 
gories, because  of  the  special  character  of  human  experience. 

1  Riehl  (Der  Philosophische  Kriticismus,  Vol.  I,  p.  358)  says  truly 
that  the  difference  between  categories  and  forms  of  judgement  is 
one,  not  of  essence,  but  of  application. 

2  For  a  determinate  object  we  require  both  thought  and  intuition, 
and  neither  thought  apart  from  intuition  nor  intuition  apart  from 
thought  can  give  us  a  determinate  object;  see  A  258  =  B  314.  For 
the  indeterminate  object  of  intuition,  see  A  20  =  B  34.  The  concept 
of  an  object  in  general  is  said  in  A  251  to  be  determinable  through 

•the  manifold  of  appearances. 

8  The  pure  forms  of  sensibility  are  also  sources  of  a  priori  know- 
ledge. Neither  sensibility  nor  understanding  is,  however,  a  source  of 
knowledge  apart  from  the  other ;  they  are  sources  of  different  elements 
in  a  priori  knowledge.  4  Compare  A  88  =  B  121  ff. 


534      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §  6 

Kant's  explanation  turns  on  the  fact  that  the  manifold  of 
intuition  must,  in  human  experience,  be  given  under  the 
form  of  time.  The  universality  and  necessity  of  the  form  of 
time  will  enable  us  to  understand  how  the  activity  of  the 
mind  can  determine,  in  accordance  with  the  synthetic  unity 
of  apperception,  the  manifold  which  is  given  in  inner 
sense.1 

When  we  grasp  the  part  played  by  time  as  the  form  of  all 
human  intuitions,  we  shall  be  able  to  understand  how  the 
necessary  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general* 
(which  we  think  a  priori  in  the  pure  categories)  can  be  the 
condition  to  which  all  objects  of  human  intuition  must  neces- 
sarily conform;  we  shall  also  be  able  to  understand  how  the 
pure  categories  (which  in  themselves  are  mere  forms  of  thought) 
can  acquire  objective  reality,  that  is,  how  they  must  apply  to 
objects  of  human  intuition.  This  in  turn  means  that  the  categories 
can  apply  to  objects  only  as  appearances  (not  as  things-in- 
themselves) ;  for,  as  we  saw  in  the  Aesthetic,  the  fact  that  we 
have  an  a  priori  intuition  of  time  implies  that  time  is  due,  not 
to  things,  but  to  our  sensibility,  and  consequently  it  implies 

1  B  150.  Kant  says  'can  determine  inner  sense  through  the  manifold 
of  given  intuitions'.  He  must,  I  think,  mean  inner  sense  as  regards 
its  form ;  compare  B  152  and  B  155.  The  statement  is  a  difficult  one; 
it  seems  to  suggest  that  in  order  to  determine  time  in  accordance 
with  the  categories  we  must  combine  the  empirical  manifold  in  time 
in  accordance  with  the  categories,  and  this  I  believe  to  be  Kant's 
view. 

2  B  150.  Kant's  own  statement  is  more  elaborate.  What  we  think 
a  priori  is  said  to  be  'synthetic  unity  of  the  apperception  of  the  manifold 
of  sensuous  intuition'.  In  this  phrase,  as  so  often,  the  synthetic  unity 
of  apperception  and  the  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  seem  to  be 
identified,  and  indeed  the  phrase  is  a  portmanteau  phrase  which 
combines  them  both  in  one.  *  Sensuous  intuition'  I  take  to  be  sensuous 
intuition  in  general. 

Kemp  Smith  attaches  'a  prior?  not  to  'thinking*  but  to  'sensuous 
intuition'.  On  this  interpretation  Kant  is  saying  that  understanding 
can  think  the  schematised  categories  as  conditions  of  all  objects  of 
human  intuition.  This  does  not  seriously  alter  the  argument,  but  I 
believe  Kant  is  explaining  how  understanding  can  think  the  pure 
categories  as  conditions  of  all  objects  of  human  intuition. 


XXIX  §  7]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  535 

that  appearances  given  under  the  form  of  time  are  not  things 
as  they  are  in  themselves,  but  are  things  only  as  they  appear 
to  us.1 

§  7.  The  Transcendental  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

K^nt  at  first  speaks  as  if  understanding  itself2  determined 
*(or  synthetised)  the  manifold  of  inner  sense  in  accordance 
with  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories.  He  now 
explains  that  this  synthesis  of  the  manifold  under  the  form 
of  time3  is  due  to  imagination.4  It  is  a  figurative  synthesis 
(synthesis  speciosd),  as  opposed  to  the  purely  intellectual 
synthesis  (synthesis  intellectualis)  which  is  present  in  the  form 
of  judgement,  and  thought  in  the  pure  category.5 

This  figurative  synthesis,  like  the  intellectual  synthesis  to 
which  it  conforms,  is  a  transcendental  synthesis;6  it  is  not 
only  itself  a  priori?  but  is  also  the  condition  of  the  possibility 
of  a  priori  knowledge.8  So  far  as  it  is  transcendental  it  is  not 
concerned  with  differences  in  the  given  manifold,  but  is 
directed9  only  to  the  unity  thought  in  the  categories, 

1  B    151.    Kant's    affirmation  of  this   is  too   brief  to    be  wholly 
clear.  He  says  'it  is  only  of  appearance  that  we  can  have  a  priori 
intuition*. 

2  B   150.  This  must  be  understanding  as  a  power  of  knowledge , 
not  merely  as  a  power  of  thought.  See  A  97. 

3  The  understanding  in  itself  has  nothing  to  do  with  time.  Compare 

A  152-3  =  B  191-3- 

4  Imagination  may,  however,  be  understanding  at  a  lower  level. 
See  B  162  n. 

5  Compare  A  118.  The  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  under  the 
unity  of  apperception  'presupposes,  or  includes*  a  pure  transcendental 
synthesis  of  the  imagination.  As  to  the  word  'figurative*  (figurlich  or 
speciosa)  I  do  not  see  that  it  adds  anything  to  the  word  'imaginative*. 

6B  151. 

7  That  is,  necessarily  and  universally  present  when  we  know  any 
object  in  time.  As  such  it  is,  on  Copernican  principles,  due  to  the 
nature  of  the  mind  itself. 

8  Apart  from  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  time  the  Principles 
could  not  be  demonstrated. 

9  B  151,  lgeht\  In  A  1 18  the  synthesis  is  said  to  be  transcendental 
if  it  is  'directed*  (geht)  only  to  the  a  priori  combination  of  the  manifold. 
The  doctrine  is  expressed  more  clearly  in  A  123.  The  transcendental 


536      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §  7 

here  identified  with  the  original  synthetic  unity  of  apper- 
ception. 

Kant  makes  perfectly  clear  what  seems  to  me  to  be  beyond 
dispute,  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
works  through  the  medium  of  time.  It  determines  sense  in 
accordance  with  its  form,  that  is  to  say,  in  accordance  with  itime.1 
It  does  so  in  conformity  with  the  unity  of  apperception,  ancl 
therefore  in  conformity  with  the  categories.2 

Imagination  itself  is  given  an  intermediate  position  between 
sense  and  understanding.  It  is  a  power  to  represent  an  object 
in  intuition,  even  when  the  object  is  not  present.  In  this  way 
it  is  connected  with3  sensibility,  since  human  intuitions  are 
sensuous.4  None  the  less  the  synthesis  of  imagination  is  always 
an  exercise  of  spontaneity.5  It  is  what  determines,  not  what  is 
determinable  (as  sense  is);  or,  in  other  words,  it  is  a  source  of 
form,  while  sense  is  a  source  of  matter.6 

Imagination  is  in  the  service  of  understanding  when  it 
synthetises  the  manifold  in  accordance  with  concepts ;  and  the 
transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  in  the  service  of 
pure  understanding  when  it  synthetises  the  manifold  in  time 
in  accordance  with  the  categories.  Hence  this  transcendental 

synthesis  'aims  at'  (zu  ihrer  Absicht  hat)  nothing  but  necessary  unity 
in  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold.  Compare  A  125  and  Chapter  XXV 
§  9.  Even  in  A  101  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  (said 
to  be  reproductive)  is  the  ground  of  a  necessary  synthetic  unity  of 
appearances. 

1  B  152.  Similarly  in  B  150  understanding  determines  inner  sense, 
because  inner  sense  has  an  a  priori  form. 

2  The  transcendental  synthesis  is  said  to  be  productive,  and  not 
reproductive.  The  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  is  governed 
by  the  categories,  while  the  synthesis  of  reproductive  imagination 
is  governed  by  the  empirical  laws  of  association.  Compare  A  123 
and  Chapter  XIX  §  3. 

8  Kant  says  'belongs  to*  (gehdrt). 

4  Compare  A  120  n.  where  imagination  is  said  to  be  an  ingredient 
in  sense-perception.  In  the  present  passage  Kant  says  that  imagination 
alone  can  give  to  the  concepts  of  the  understanding  a  corresponding 
intuition.  Compare  A  99.

synthesis1  is  the  first  working2  of  understanding  upon  sensi- 
bility, and  the  first  application3  of  understanding  to  objects 
of  human  experience.4  Nevertheless  as  a  figurative  synthesis  it 
is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  purely  intellectual  synthesis 
which  is  to  be  found  in  the  forms  of  judgement  (or  the  pure 
categories)  independently  of  imagination,  and  which  belongs 
to  understanding  alone.5 

In  this  way  imagination  seems  almost  to  become  a  lower 
manifestation  of  understanding  itself  acting  directly  upon 
intuitions  given  under  the  form  of  time.  This  is  stated 
^explicitly  later.6  The  empirical  synthesis  of  apprehension 
(which  is  the  work  of  imagination)  must  conform  to  the 
synthesis  of  apperception,  that  is,  to  the  purely  intellectual 
synthesis  contained  in  the  pure  category.7  It  is  one  and  the 
same  spontaneity  which  there  under  the  name  of  imagination, 
and  here  under  the  name  of  understanding,  introduces 
combination  into  the  manifold  of  intuition.8 

§  8.  Aim  of  the  Subjective  Deduction 

In  §  26  we  have  the  essence  of  the  Subjective  Deduction.9 
Kant  begins  with  his  usual  introduction,  summarising  what 

1  I  agree  with  Kemp  Smith's  translation,  though  the  text  'welches' 
seems  to  me  odd,  if  it  is  correct. 

2  B  152,  'Wirkung*.  Compare  B  164.   Imagination  depends  upon 
understanding  as  regards  the  unity  of  its  intellectual  synthesis,  and 
depends  upon  sensibility  as  regards  the  manifold  of  apprehension. 

3  Compare  A  77-8  =  B  103. 

4  'to  the  objects  of  our  possible  intuition/ 

6  The  intellectual  synthesis  thought  in  the  pure  category  concerns 
only  the  manifold  of  intuition  in  general:  it  has  in  itself  no  reference 
to  time;  compare  B  151.

7  Compare  A  108,  A  114,  and  B  164. 

8  In  A  97  spontaneity  is   said   to  be   the  source  of  the  threefold 
synthesis. 

9  Kant's  own  heading  is  'Transcendental  Deduction  of  the  univer- 
sally possible  employment  in  experience  of  the  pure  concepts  of  the 
understanding*.  This  heading  is  not  very  apt,  unless  Experience* 
can  be  assumed  to  mean  * human  experience*. 


538     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXIX  §  9 

has  gone  before.1  We  have  proved  that  the  categories,  whose 
a  priori  origin  was  shown  in  the  Metaphysical  Deduction, 
give  us  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects  of  intuition  in  general. 
We  have  now  to  show  that  they  give  us  a  priori  knowledge 
of  objects  of  human  intuition.2 

In  so  doing  we  shall  be  concerned,  not  with  the  form  of 
intuition  under  which  objects  are  given,  but  with  the  laws  of 
combination  imposed  on  them  if  they  are  to  be  thought  as 
objects.  We  have  to  explain  how  understanding  prescribes  laws 
to  nature,  and  so  makes  nature  possible.3  Unless  we  can  do 
this,  we  shall  never  understand  how  everything  that  is  offered 
to  our  sense  must  be  obedient  to  laws  which  have  their  origin 
in  the  human  understanding. 

§  9.  The  Synthesis  of  Apprehension 

The  argument  starts  from  the  synthesis  of  apprehension. 
This  is  defined  as  the  combination  of  the  manifold  in  one 
empirical  intuition,  whereby  sense-perception — that  is,  empi- 
rical consciousness  of  the  intuition  (as  appearance) — is  possible.4 

Sense-perception  by  itself  gives  us  consciousness  of  appear- 


1  B  159.  Although  §  26  is  headed  'Transcendental  Deduction',  he 
asserts  that  the  Transcendental  Deduction  is  to  be  found  in  §§  20—1. 
Both  are  transcendental  deductions,  but  the  former  was  concerned 
with  the  objective,  and  the  present  with  the  subjective,  side  of  the 
Deduction.  This  is,  I  think,  the  only  place  where  Kant  uses  the 
phrase  'Metaphysical  Deduction*. 

Incidentally,  the  presence  of  little  introductions  even  in  the  second 
edition  suggests  that  this  is  a  natural  characteristic  of  Kant's  style, 
and  requires  no  further  explanation  such  as  the  patchwork  theory 
attempts  to  offer. 

2  This  will  be  an  answer  to  the  question  'How  can  the  power  of 
thinking  give  us  a  priori  knowledge?' — see  Chapter  XVIII  §  4;  for, 
strictly  speaking,  a  priori  knowledge  of  objects  of  intuition  in  general 
is  not  knowledge  until  we  can  indicate  the  nature  of  the  intuitions 
so  described. 

3  For  the  two  senses  of  nature,  see  B  163  and  B  165  and  §  15  below. 

4  B  1 60.  This  is,  I  think,  the  same  as  the  empirical  synthesis  of 
apprehension  in  A  99  and  A  120.  It  must  include  in  itself  the  empirical 
synthesis  of  reproduction.  Compare  A  102  and  A  121. 


XXIX  §  xo]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  539 

ances,  not  of  objects.1  None  the  less  sense-perception  is  in 
a  particularly  close  relation  with  objects,  since  it  involves 
sensation;2  for  sensation  (although  it  is  only  a  subjective 
modification  of  the  mind3  and  not  the  idea  of  an  object4) 
presupposes  the  actual  presence  of  the  object.5  Furthermore 
the  synthesis  of  apprehension  gives  unity  to  our  intuitions, 
ft  is  conditioned  by  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  time,  and 
when  it  is  brought  to  concepts  or  judged,  we  have  knowledge 
of  objects.6 

The  precise  meaning  of  sense-perception  or  apprehension 
is,  as  usual,7  not  too  certain,  but  as  we  find  Kant  talking  later 
of  perceiving  a  house,8  we  must  not  suppose  that  it  is  to  be 
restricted  to  consciousness  of  a  mere  sensum.9 

§  10.  Apprehension  Involves  Space  and  Time 

Kant's  next  point  is  this.  Space  and  time  are  forms  of  all 
intuition,  and  therefore  the  synthesis  of  apprehension,  since 
it  combines  the  given  manifold  in  one  intuition,  must  do  so 
in  conformity  with  space  and  time.10 

I  take  this  to  mean  simply  that  the  synthesis  of  apprehension 
combines  the  manifold  in  time  and  space,  or  in  other  words 
that  the  given  manifold  appears  to  us  as  combined  in  time  and 
space,  because  (and  only  because)  of  our  act  of  synthesis.

of  water.  In  these  cases  it  is  obvious  that  apprehension  and  sense- 
perception  involve  reproduction. 

9  Compare  Chapter  XIX  §  2.  One  would  like  to  know  whether  there 
is  a  synthesis  of  apprehension  present  in  dreams.  I  am  inclined  to 
think  not,  because  the  actual  presence  of  the  object  is  not  presupposed 
in  dreams.  There  must,  however,  be  at  least  something  analogous 
to  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  even  in  dreams  and  in  the  imagination 
of  the  artist.  l°  B  160. 


540     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §11 

The  reason  by  which  Kant  supports  his  contention  offers 
some  difficulty.  He  says  that  this  must  be  true  'because  the 
synthesis  itself  can  take  place  only  in  accordance  with  this 
form'.1  'This  form'  appears  to  be  used  generally  in  order  to 
cover  both  the  form  of  space  and  the  form  of  time.2  If  so, 
Kant  is  saying  merely  that  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  must 
conform  to  space  and  time,  because  unless  it  does  so  it  cannot 
take  place  at  all.3 

§11.  Space  and  Time  Involve  Unity 

If  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  combines  the  manifold  in 
time  and  space,  it  presupposes  a  synthesis — a  transcendental 
synthesis — of  the  one  time  and  space  in  which  the  manifold 
is  combined.  This  synthesis  has  already  been  discussed,4  but 
Kant,  in  accordance  with  his  curious  methods  of  exposition,5 
proceeds  to  make  his  point  without  any  explicit  reference  to 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination. 

Space  and  time  as  forms  of  intuition  are  a  mere  multiplicity 
without  unity.  It  is  only  as  pure  intuitions  that  they  possess 
unity.6  This  necessary  unity  was  treated  in  the  Aesthetic  as 
if  it  belonged  to  space  and  time  in  their  own  right,7  but 
space  and  time,  as  pure  intuitions,  possess  unity  only  because 

1  Kemp  Smith  translates  lnur   nach  dieser  Form*  as  'in  no  other 
way'. 

2  In  A  93  =  B  125  the  formal  Condition'  (Bedingung)  of  sensibility 
is  used  in  the  singular  to  cover  both  space  and  time,  but  there  are 
reasons  for  this  in  the  context.  'This  form'  can  hardly  be  intended 
to  refer  to  time  alone  or  to  the  fact  that  the  synthesis  of  apprehension 
is  itself  successive. 

3  We  might  perhaps  say  that  because  space  and  time  are  forms  of 
intuition,  we  cannot  synthetise  a  given  manifold  without  synthetising 
also  the  space  in  which,  and  the  time  during  which,  it  is  given.  Kant, 
I  take  it,  is  here  concerned  only  with  the  particular  times  and  spaces 
in  which  appearances  are  given;  in  the  next  paragraph  he  passes  to 
the  doctrine  that  there  is  only  one  time  and  space  of  which  particular 
times  and  spaces  are  parts.  *  B  150  ff. 

6  At  crucial  points  in  the  argument  he  almost  invariably  leaves  us 
to  fill  in  some  of  the  steps  by  a  recollection  of  what  has  gone  before.

XXIX  §  12]       THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  541 

they  presuppose  a  synthesis  which  does  not  belong  to  sense 
at  all.1 

Unity  is  therefore  given  along  with2  the  pure  intuitions  of 
space  and  time,  but  it  is  not  given  in  these  intuitions.3  This 
unity  of  time  and  space  is  an  a  priori  condition  of  the  synthesis 
of  apprehension.  That  is  to  say,  everything  that  is  to  be 
represented  determinately4  in  time  and  space  must  conform  to 
this  necessary  unity  (or  necessary  combination)  which  is 
involved  in  the  nature  of  time  and  space  themselves. 

If  we  put  this  in  less  technical  language,  we  may  say  that 
Because  there  is  only  one  time  and  one  space,  the  manifold 
given  must  be  synthetised  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  appear 
in  one  time  and  one  space.  The  whole  argument  of  the 
Analogies  turns  on  this  contention. 

The  full  implications  of  this  will  not  become  clear  till  we 
come  to  the  Principles.  The  word  'determinately'  in  the 
above  assertion  is  of  importance.  Even  appearances  in  dreams 
are  spatial  and  temporal,  but  they  have  not  a  determinate 
position  in  one  common  space  and  time.  It  is  this  determinate 
position  which  is  the  mark  of  real  objects,  and  of  real  objects 
alone.6 

§  12.  The  Subjective  Deduction 

We  now  come  to  the  contention  on  which  the  whole  argument 
turns.  As  so  often  in  Kant, it  is  compressed  into  a  single  sentence. 

The  necessary  synthetic  unity  which  must  belong  to  all  the 
manifold  of  human  intuition,  if  the  manifold  is  to  be  combined 
in  one  space  and  time,  is  identical  with  that  necessary  synthetic 

1  B  160-1  n.  This  synthesis  is  presumably  the  transcendental  syn- 
thesis of  imagination,  but  Kant  does  not  think  it  necessary  to  say 
this.  Ultimately  the  intellectual  synthesis  thought  in  the  pure  cate- 
gories is  also  presupposed. 

2  B  161,  'zugleich  mit\  Perhaps  this  means  'simultaneously  with', 
but  I  prefer  to  keep  a  neutral  phrase. 

3  It  is  not  given  in  the  intuitions,  because  it  is  imposed  on  the 
intuitions  by  the  transcendental  synthesis.  4  'bestimmt.' 

5  The  word  'determinately1  perhaps  suggests  also  that  the  manifold 
is  'determined*  in  accordance  with  the  categories.  Compare  B  128-9. 


542    THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXIX  §  i* 

unity  of  the  manifold  of  a  given  intuition  in  general  which  is 
involved  in  the  transcendental  unity  of  apperception  and 
thought  in  the  pure  categories.1  The  only  difference  is  that 
the  unity  of  an  intuition  in  general  is  now  applied  to,  or  mani- 
fested in,  our  human  intuitions  which  are  given  under  the  forms 
of  time  and  space. 

With  this  doctrine  we  are  already  familiar.  It  is  another 
form  of  the  contention  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination,  which  is  the  condition  of  synthetising  the  given 
manifold  in  one  space  and  time,  is  a  synthesis  in  accordance 
with  the  unity  of  apperception  and  the  categories. 

If  this  is  true,  the  synthesis  of  apprehension  necessary  for 
sense-perception  must  conform  to  the  categories.2  And  since 
human  experience  is  knowledge  by  means  of  connected  sense- 
perceptions,3  the  categories  are  a  priori  conditions  of  the 
possibility  of  such  experience.  They  are  consequently  valid 
a  priori  for  all  objects  of  human  experience. 

The  question  is  whether  this  fundamental  contention  is,  or 
is  not,  true.  Kant's  theory  of  the  forms  of  judgement  makes 
him  confident  that  it  must  be  true,  but  this  ground  of  confi- 
dence we  can  hardly  share.  His  argument  is,  however,  not  yet 
at  an  end.  He  intends  to  show  that  corresponding  to  each  pure 
category  there  is  a  schema,  or  a  transcendental  determination 
of  time.4  He  also  believes  he  can  prove  that  these  schemata 
are  necessarily  involved  in  all  experience  of  objects  in  one 
common  space  and  time.  For  the  present  he  gives  us  two 
illustrations  of  his  meaning,  a  concession  which  he  did  not 
make  in  the  first  edition. 

1  B  161.  It  is  thought  in  the  pure  categories  because  it  is  thought 
in  the  forms  of  judgement.  Compare  also  B  144-5. 

2  Kant  is  presuming  that  sense-perception,  though  it  gives  us  only 
appearances,  gives  us  appearances  united  in  one  space  and  time, 
and  so  capable  of  being  thought  as  objects.  It  is  more  than  a  mere 
association  of  ideas.

XXIX  §  1 3]        THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  543 

§  13.  The  Category  of  Quantity 

His  first  illustration  concerns  the  category  of  quantity.1 
When  I  perceive  a  house,2  the  necessary  unity  of  space,  and 
consequently  of  the  manifold3  in  space,  is  presupposed.  More 
simply,  I  presuppose  that  the  house  occupies  a  part  of  the 
one  common4  space  in  which  all  objects  are.  In  combining  the 
successively  given5  appearances  into  one  intuition  of  a  house, 
I  as  if  were  draw  the  shape  of  the  house  in  conformity  with 
the  necessary6  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  in  space.7  This 
^necessary  synthetic  unity  to  which  the  synthesis  of  appre- 
hension must  conform  is  identical — when  I  consider  it  in 
abstraction  from  the  form  of  space — with  the  necessary  syn- 
thetic unity  thought  in  the  category  of  quantity,  or  more 
strictly  in  the  category  of  totality. 

At  the  present  stage  of  the  argument  there  should  be  no 
great  difficulty  in  seeing  the  plausibility  of  this  contention. 
The  reason  for  it  is  that  in  the  category  of  totality8  we 
think  the  synthesis9  of  the  homogeneous  in  an  intuition  in 

1  B  162. 

2  Kant  is  assuming  that  what  is  perceived  is  a  real  object.  For 
knowledge  of  such  an  object  thought  is  necessary  as  well  as  the  synthesis 
of  apprehension,  but  the  special  point  Kant  is  making  is  that  sense- 
perception  (or  the  synthesis  of  apprehension)  must  itself  conform 
to  the  categories  of  the  understanding. 

3  I  take  this  manifold  to  be  the  empirical  manifold  of  all  outer 
intuition.  Kant  describes  it  as  'outer  sensuous  intuition  in  general*. 
It  is  perhaps  just  possible  that  Kant  may  mean  the  pure  manifold. 

4  One  objective  space  is  assumed  to  be  common  to  all  men  as  well 
as  to  contain  all  bodies. 

6  I  may,  and  probably  do,  supplement  the  given  appearances  with 
others  added  by  imagination,  but  it  is  not  necessary  to  take  these 
into  account  for  purposes  of  the  argument. 

6  I  introduce  the  word  'necessary',  because  the  'synthetic  unity* 
mentioned  here  is  the  same  as  the  'necessary  unity*  mentioned  above. 

7  That  is  to  say,  I  draw  its  shape  as  a  part  of  the  one  common  space 
and  so  as  having  necessarily  the  characteristics  which  belong  to  such 
parts  of  the  one  common  space.

plurality  are  both  involved  in  the  category  of  totality.  See  Bin. 

9  Or  the  synthetic  unity. 


544     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §  14 

general^  In  synthetising  space  we  are  synthetising  the  homo- 
geneous; for  space  is  essentially  homogeneous,  and  every 
particular  space  is  made  up  of  spaces.  The  synthesis  of  the 
pure  manifold  of  space  is  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  appre- 
hension whereby  we  perceive  a  house.  Consequently  in  per- 
ceiving a  house  we  are  synthetising  the  manifold  under  the 
category  of  quantity. 

Whatever  else  the  house  is,  it  must  be  composed  of  parts 
outside  one  another  in  space,  and  these  parts,  so  far  as  they 
are  spatial,  are  necessarily  homogeneous.  They  can  be  divided 
into  so  many  feet  or  inches.2  In  this  way  the  house  must  be 
an  extensive  quantity. 

We  can  therefore  understand,  not  only  that  the  category 
of  quantity  must  apply  to  all  objects — this  is  true  for  Kant 
because  of  his  theory  of  the  forms  of  judgement — but  also  how 
it  necessarily  applies  to  all  objects  given  in  human  intuition 
under  the  forms  of  space  and  time.3 

§  14.  The  Category  of  Causality 

Kant's  contention  becomes  much  more  difficult,  when  we 
pass  to  his  second  illustration,  which  is  an  instance  of  causality.4 

When  I  perceive  the  freezing  of  water,  I  apprehend  two 
states  (fluidity  and  solidity)5  as  standing  in  a  temporal  relation 
to  one  another.  If  these  two  states  are  to  be  objectively  deter- 
mined6 (as  regards  their  time-sequence),  they  must  have  a 

1  As  I  have  suggested — see  Chapter  XIV  §  8 — this  is  implied  not 
merely  by  the  form  of  the  universal  judgement,  but  by  all  conception 
as  such. 

2  For  this  reason  they  must  be  measurable,  not  only  in  relation 
to  one  another,  but  also  in  relation  to  all  other  objects  in  space. 

3  The  argument  for  time  is  precisely  similar  to  the  argument  for 
space.  The  fact  that  Kant  takes  space,  rather  than  time,  to  illustrate 
his  meaning  is  typical  of  the  second  edition,  though  by  no  means 
absent  from  the  first.  4  B  162. 

5  Kant,  as  often,  avoids  the  simple  case  of  causality  where  of  two 
successive  events  the  first  is  cause  and  the  second  effect. 

6  Note  the  word  'bestimmt*.  Compare  B  161  and  §  n  of  the  present 
chapter.  Kant  is  distinguishing  an  objective  succession  of  events 
from  a  subjective  succession  such  as  takes  place  when  I  see  the  parts 


XXIX  §  i5]      THE  SUBJECTIVE  DEDUCTION  545 

determinate  position  relatively  to  one  another  in  one  common 
time.1  They  can  have  this  position,  Kant  believes,  only  if  they 
are  causally  determined,  \vhich  in  a  more  simple  case  than  this 
would  mean  that  the  first  event  is  the  cause  of  the  second.2 
Hence  there  must  be  a  necessary  synthetic  unity,  or  a  causal 
connexion,  wherever  we  perceive  successive  events  in  time. 
•This* necessary  synthetic  unity,  when  we  abstract  from  the 
time  element,  is  identical  with  the  necessary  synthetic  unity 
thought  in  the  pure  category  which  Kant  calls  cause  and  effect. 
It  ought  strictly  to  be  called  the  pure  category  of  ground  and 
consequent,  since  it  has  no  reference  to  time.3 

We  are  not  in  a  position  to  estimate  this  contention  until 
we  have  examined  the  Second  Analogy.4  If  it  were  true,  Kant 
would  have  shown  how  the  pure  category  of  ground  and 
consequent  must  apply  to  all  objects  given  in  human  intuition 
under  the  form  of  time. 

Similar  illustrations  could  be  given  for  all  the  other  cate- 
gories. 

§15.  Understanding  as  Lawgiver

corresponding  passage  of  the  first  edition,5  with  which  this 
passage6  should  be  compared.7

change  or  succession  in  the  house.  See  A  190-1  =  B  235-6. 

1  Objective  time  must  be  one  and  the  same  for  all  men  and  all  events.

of  the  water  is  determined  by  some  non-specified  cause. 

3  It  is  derived  from  the  form  of  judgement  'If  A,  then  B'. 

4  The  reason  why  his  argument  is  not  obvious,  as  in  the  first 
illustration,  is  that  in  the  case  of  quantity  we  have  intuitive  certainty, 
but  in  the  case  of  causality  we  have  only  discursive  certainty;  see 
Ai6i-2  =  B2OI  and  A  180  =  8223.  Nevertheless  we  can  see  that  the 
synthesis  of  cause  and  effect  is  the  synthesis  of  a  ground  which 
precedes  its  consequent  in  time,  and  when  we  consider  it  in  abstraction 
from  time  it  is  identical  with  the  synthesis  of  ground  and  consequent. 
What  remains  to  be  proved  is  that  causality  is  necessary  to  maintain 
the  unity  of  time.

546     THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXIX  §  15 

Appearances  exist  only  in  relation  to  the  human  mind  so  far 
as  it  possesses  sensibility,  and  the  laws  governing  appearances 
exist  only  in  relation  to  the  human  mind  so  far  as  it  possesses 
understanding.  The  laws  of  nature  are  imposed  by  the  mind 
upon  the  phenomenal  world,  but  it  is  only  the  universal  laws 
or  principles  which  are  so  imposed.  Particular  laws  cannot 
be  deduced  from  these  universal  principles,  but  mtfet  be 
learned  through  experience.1 

In  all  this  the  dependence  of  objects  on  the  humanrmind 
is  bound  up  with  our  knowledge  of  their  necessity.  This  is 
equally  manifest  in  his  final  summary,2  where  he  reaffirms  his 
Copernican  principles,3  and  rejects  the  theory  of  pre-established 
harmony  with  that  contempt  which  it  deserves.4

a  cause.  2§  27,  B  165-8.

CHAPTER    XXX 
THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION 

§  i .  The  Analysis  of  Experience 

THe  crossing  of  the  Great  Arabian  Desert  can  scarcely 
be  a  more  exhausting  task  than  is  the  attempt  to  master  the 
windings  and  twistings  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction. 
Nevertheless,  as  we  look  back  upon  the  way  which  we  have 
traversed  under  Kant's  guidance,  we  may  perhaps  conclude 
that  some  of  the  difficulty  is  of  the  sort  to  be  found  in  reading 
the  description  of  a  game  which  we  have  never  played.  When 
we  have  mastered  the  game,  we  may  still  have  trouble  in 
making,  or  even  in  following,  an  exact  description  of  it;  but 
once  the  game  is  understood,  the  description  becomes  rela- 
tively easy,  and  the  game  itself  is  seen  to  be  simple. 

Kant's  elaborate  argument  is  a  philosophical  analysis  of 
human  experience  on  its  cognitive  side.  Once  we  have  a  clear 
view  of  what  he  is  describing,  the  description  itself  will  become 
relatively  clear.  If  on  the  other  hand  we  fail  to  see  what  he  is 
describing,  and  if  we  imagine  that  he  is  describing  something 
quite  different — for  example,  if  we  suppose  he  is  trying  to  show 
how  we  come  to  have  knowledge  of  objects,  or  how  experience 
develops  in  time — then  everything  that  he  says  will  seem 
to  be  almost  perversely  nonsensical  and  to  be  written,  as  he 
himself  suggests,  in  a  kind  of  double  Dutch.1 

Kant  is  trying  to  make  us  see  what  is,  and  must  be,  involved 
in  all  human  experience,  that  is,  in  all  our  knowledge  of  objects ; 
and  the  objects  about  which  he  is  thinking  are  primarily, 
though  not  exclusively,  physical  objects. 

If  we  are  to  know  objects,  we  must  have  something  given 
to  us  in  sensation,  and  that  something  must  be  given  to  us 
under  the  forms  of  space  and  time.  What  is  given  us  at  any 
moment  is  in  itself  transitory,  and  is  very  much  less  rich  in 
content  than  we  commonly  suppose.  We  are  always  interpreting 
1  See  Pro/.  Vorw.  (IV  262). 


548       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  i 

it  and  supplementing  it  in  thought  and  imagination.  It  is 
given  here  and  now,  but  it  must  be  combined  or  connected 
with  what  has  been  given  previously,  and  it  must  be  assigned 
a  definite  position  relatively  to  other  appearances  in  one  time 
and  space.  In  order  to  do  this  we  must  fill  out  or  construct 
the  unchanging  space  and  the  continually  changing  time  in 
which  such  positions  must  be  assigned.  Only  so  can  we  have 
before  us  a  particular  part  of  the  one  world  which  exists  for 
us  in  a  single  space  and  time. 

In  all  this  there  is  more  at  work  than  the  synthesis  of  imagina- 
tion. There  is  also  judgement.  All  sorts  of  irrelevant  images 
may  be  passing  through  our  minds  at  the  same  time,  but  we 
distinguish  these  images  from  the  one  objective  world  which 
we  construct  in  imagination  on  the  basis  of  our  given  and 
changing  sensa.  It  is  not  enough  that  ideas  or  images  should 
be  together  in  our  minds,  or  that  they  should  be  suggested  to 
us  by  what  is  given.  In  judgement  we  assert  an  objective  con- 
nexion and  separate,  so  far  as  we  can,  subjective  appearance 
from  objective  reality.  The  greenness  of  the  grass  may  suggest 
to  me  the  hills  of  Paradise,  but  what  I  know  is  Quainton  Hill, 
and  I  judge  that  Quainton  Hill  is  green. 

So  to  judge  is  to  distinguish,  however  vaguely,  between 
subject  and  object,  between  my  thinking  and  what  I  think; 
and  apart  from  thinking  there  could  be  for  me  no  distinction 
between  an  objective  world  in  time  and  space  and  the  sub- 
jective succession  of  my  own  ideas.  Thinking  implies  some 
degree  of  self-consciousness,  since  it  affirms  an  objective,  as 
opposed  to  a  subjective,  world.  And  all  my  thinking  must 
be  in  some  sense  one  thinking,  as  I  set  the  different  parts 
of  one  objective  world  over  against  myself. 

Empirical  and  pure  intuition,  an  empirical  and  a  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination,  thought  of  the  object  and 
thought  of  the  self,  these,  difficult  though  they  be  in  a  philo- 
sophical analysis,  must  be  present  when  we  experience  any 
object.  They  are  all  involved  in  my  simple  judgement  that  this 
hill  is  green.  They  are  not  stages  on  the  way  to  experience,  but 
elements  in  experience;  and  Kant's  contention  is  that  when 


XXX  §  2]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        549 

we  understand  these  elements,  we  can  make  a  priori  assertions 
as  to  what  every  object  of  experience  must  necessarily  be. 

§2.  The  Demand  of  Thought 

We  shall,  I  think,  understand  Kant's  argument  best,  if  we 
start*  with  his  view  in  regard  to  the  nature  of  thought.  In 
considering  this  we  shall  do  well  to  keep  before  our  minds 
thought  which  is  concerned  with  physical  objects.  Indeed 
it  is  on  this  alone  that  I  propose  to  concentrate  here. 

Human  thought  is  not  by  itself  a  direct  acquaintance  with 
reality.  It  always  takes  place  by  means  of  concepts,  and  we 
apply  these  concepts  to  a  reality  which  is  given  to  sense  or 
which  is  assumed  to  be  capable  of  being  given  to  sense.  In 
other  words  we  think  'about'  reality  by  means  of  concepts; 
or  in  Kant's  language  thought  is  not  intuitive,  but  discursive. 
To  think  is  to  judge;  and  in  judgement  we  combine  concepts, 
and  apply  them  to  reality  or  affirm  them  of  reality. 

On  this  view  truth  is  to  be  found  in  correspondence  between 
our  judgements  and  the  particular  reality  which  we  judge. 
For  example,  in  the  concept  'house'  we  think  of  a  combination 
of  'marks'  supposed  to  be  found  in  a  number  of  sensible 
objects;  and  in  the  concept  'red'  we  think  of  a  'mark' 
supposed  to  be  found,  along  with  others,  in  a  number  of 
sensible  objects.  When  we  judge  that  this  house  is  red,  we 
not  only  combine  our  concepts  in  the  judgement;  we  also 
affirm  that  the  combination  of  marks  thought  in  these  con- 
cepts is  to  be  found  in  this  individual  sensible  object.  If 
our  senses  give  us  a  complex  intuition  in  which  the  marks 
of  a  house  are  combined  with  the  intuition  of  red,  then  our 
judgement  is  true.1 

It  may  be  said  that  this  correspondence  between  our  judge- 

1  A  similar  principle  holds  if  even  an  analytic  judgement — such 
as  'All  bodies  are  extended* — is  to  be  true  of  reality.  I  ignore  all 
difficulties  as  to  the  way  in  which  the  marks  thought  in  the  concept 
differ  from  intuitions;  and  I  ignore  also,  for  the  sake  of  simpli- 
city, Kant's  distinction  between  Marks'  and  'partial  ideas';  see 
Chapter  IX  §  4. 


550        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  2 

ments  and  reality — or  between  the  combination  of  marks 
thought  in  our  judgements  and  the  combination  of  intuitions 
found  in  sensible  reality — is  easy  to  understand.  Reality  is 
given  to  our  senses,  and  we  make  our  concepts  and  judgements 
by  acts  of  analysis  and  abstraction.  If  we  perform  these  acts 
of  analysis  and  abstraction  correctly,  we  have  correspondence 
and  truth.  In  the  particular  example  given,  we  have  a  complex? 
intuition  of  a  house,  and  of  this  intuition  an  intuition  of  red 
is  a  part.  The  judgement  'This  house  is  red*  merely  affirms 
in  conceptual  terms  a  combination  given  in  intuition,  recog- 
nising at  the  same  time  that  there  might  be  similar  combina- 
tions in  other  intuitions  of  houses,  and  similar  reds  in  other 
intuitions  of  red  objects. 

With  such  a  statement  Kant,  as  I  understand  him,  would 
agree,  but  he  would  add  certain  qualifications. 

He  would  deny  that  sense  by  itself  can  give  us  that  reality 
which  we  call  a  house,  and  still  more  that  it  can  give  us  an 
ordered  and  objective  world  of  which  this  house  is  a  part. 
We  must  in  imagination  combine  the  present  given  appearances 
with  past  appearances,  and  perhaps  with  appearances  not  given 
to  sense  at  all.1  Above  all  we  must  regard  the  appearances 
given  at  different  times  and  through  different  senses  as  appear- 
ances of  one  and  the  same  object,  namely  a  house;  and  we 
must  regard  the  sum  of  these  appearances,  not  as  a  mere 
phantasm  of  our  imagination,  but  as  constituting  a  real 
object  in  an  ordered  world.  This  is  impossible  apart  from 
thought. 

The  reality  which  we  analyse  in  making  our  judgement  that 
this  house  is  red  is  therefore  a  reality  which  is  given,  not 
to  mere  sense,  but  to  sense  and  thought;  and  apart  from 
thought  it  would  not  be  an  object  for  us.  Moreover — and  this 
is  the  point  at  which  Kant's  transcendental  doctrine  begins 
to  play  its  part — thought  has  demands  of  its  own  which  must 

1  We  take  it  for  granted  that,  for  example,  the  interior  of  the  house 
is  not  solid  but  is  divided  up  into  rooms.  We  also  take  it  for  granted 
that  the  walls  which  we  have  seen  and  not  touched  are  hard  and 
solid. 


XXX  §2]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        551 

be  satisfied,  if  we  are  to  have  any  object  before  us  for  purposes 
of  analysis,  and  if  our  thinking  is  to  have  a  corresponding 
object  and  so  to  be  true. 

The  fundamental  demand  of  thought  is  that  reality  should 
be  thinkable.  In  conception  and  judgement  we  think  a  com- 
bination of  marks,  and  for  this  it  is  necessary  that  one  and  the 
sam£  mind — or  (if  we  wish  to  avoid  metaphysical  implications) 
one  and  the  same  thinking — should  be  able  to  hold  before 
itsel£  these  marks  in  combination.  Thought,  we  may  say, 
manifests  itself  necessarily  in  the  synthesis  of  concepts;  and 
if  truth  is  to  be  possible  at  all,  there  must  be  a  corresponding 
synthesis  or  combination  in  the  manifold  which  is  assumed 
to  be  given  to  sense. 

This  does  not  mean  that  there  must  be  in  reality  a  combina- 
tion of  the  manifold  corresponding  to  the  combination  of 
marks  thought  in  any  particular  concept  such  as  'house'  or 
'chair'  or  'chimaera'.  It  does  mean  that  there  must  be  in  reality 
a  combination  of  the  manifold  corresponding  to  the  combina- 
tion of  marks  which  is  involved  in  all  conception  as  such 
or  all  judgement  as  such.  Without  such  combination  in  the 
manifold  there  can  be  no  truth  at  all,  no  knowledge  of  objects, 
and  no  objects  for  us. 

We  may  put  this  more  technically  by  saying  that  the  syn- 
thetic unity  of  thought — or  the  synthetic  unity  of  apperception, 
if  thought  is  supposed  to  be  conscious,  however  dimly,  of  its 
own  essential  nature — demands  a  corresponding  synthetic  unity 
in  the  given  manifold.  This  implies  that  every  individual 
object  must  possess  synthetic  unity,  if  it  is  to  be  an  object  for 
us;  and  the  whole  of  reality  must  possess  synthetic  unity 
so  far  as  it  can  be  an  object  for  us. 

To  say  this  is  in  some  ways  to  say  very  little,  though  even 
this  little  is  denied,  I  think  mistakenly,  by  some  philosophers. 
I  ignore  for  the  present  the  fact  that  the  manifold  could  never 
possess  synthetic  unity  for  us  apart  from  the  synthesis  of 
imagination  as  manifested  in  apprehension  and  reproduction. 
All  I  am  suggesting  is  that  thought  demands  the  syn- 
thetic unity  of  the  manifold,  and  if  this  demand  cannot  be 


552        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  3 

satisfied  there  can  be  for  us  no  truth,  and  no  knowledge  of 
objects.1 

To  sum  up — Kant  maintains  that  the  manifold  must  have 
synthetic  unity  in  the  interests  of  thought.  He  denies  that  we 
could  know  this  unity  to  be  necessary  merely  by  contemplation 
of  given  reality. 

§3.  The  Forms  of  Thought 

The  contention  that  synthetic  unity  of  the  manifold  is 
necessary  for  experience  remains  extremely  vague,  unless  we 
can  describe  in  detail  the  nature  of  this  synthetic  unity.  It  may 
be  important  to  point  out  that  apart  from  principles  of  synthesis 
there  can  be  no  experience  of  objects;  but  unless  we  can 
specify  these  principles,  we  are  asserting  the  very  minimum 
of  truth. 

The  Transcendental  Deduction  is  not  concerned  with  the 
separate  categories :  its  only  aim  is  to  demonstrate  the  objective 
validity  of  categories  in  general.  Nevertheless  it  must  be 
understood  in  its  context,  and  its  value  must  be  estimated 
in  the  light  both  of  the  Metaphysical  Deduction  which  precedes 
it  and  of  the  Principles  which  follow.  Until  we  have  examined 
the  separate  Principles  of  the  Understanding,  we  are  not  in 
a  position  to  assess  the  value  of  the  Critical  doctrine;  but 
it  would  be  folly  not  to  recognise  that  the  argument  appears 
to  break  down  on  one  vital  point,  the  very  point  which  Kant 
himself  regarded  as  the  most  certain  and  the  most  secure. 

Kant  believes  that  the  system  of  the  Kritik  carries  with 
it  apodeictic  certainty  to  those  who  accept  two  principles: 
(i)  that  all  our  intuitions  are  sensuous,  and  (2)  that  the  complete 
table  of  categories  is  derived  from  the  forms  of  judgement.2 
To  say  this  is  to  say  that  the  argument  rests  on  the  Metaphysical 
Deduction. 

1  I  take  it  that  what  Kant  calls  the  intellectual  synthesis  includes, 
not  only  the  synthesis  of  marks,  but  also  the  synthesis  of  the  manifold 
in  general;  for  the  aim  of  thought  is  not  merely  to  combine  marks, 
but  to  affirm  that  this  combination  has  an  instance  or  instances  in 
reality  itself.  2  M.A.d.N.  Vw.  (IV  474  n.). 


XXX  §  3]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        553 

In  this  respect,  as  in  others,  Kant's  own  view  of  his  argument 
seems  to  me  to  be  sound.  The  Metaphysical  Deduction  rests 
upon  the  list  of  the  forms  of  judgement.  The  Transcendental 
Deduction — both  on  its  primary  or  objective  side,  and  there- 
fore also  in  some  degree  on  its  secondary  or  subjective  side — 
rests  upon  the  Metaphysical  Deduction.  It  follows  that  if  we 
cannot  accept  the  list  of  the  forms  of  judgement  as  offering 
us  a  priori  certainty,  the  whole  fabric  of  the  Transcendental 
Deduction,  and  therefore  of  the  Kritik,  is  threatened  in  its 
very  foundations. 

That  this  is  so  must  be  frankly  admitted,  as  it  would  be 
admitted  by  Kant  himself.  The  weakness  of  the  Deduction 
as  a  whole  is  not  its  inconsistency,  but  the  fact  that  it  is  built 
consistently  on  a  logic  which  has  now  been  superseded. 

We  can  afford  to  smile  nowadays  at  Kant's  devotion  to 
Formal  Logic ;  and  his  defects  in  this  matter  have  been  so  often 
condemned,  and  indeed  exaggerated,  that  I  need  not  dwell 
further  on  this  topic.  Nevertheless  the  more  I  study  the  Kritik, 
the  less  confident  do  1  feel  that  his  view  as  to  the  nature  of 
judgement  is  merely  artificial ;  and  the  question  arises  whether 
his  doctrine  cannot  be  freed  from  its  connexion  with  the  table 
of  forms,  and  stated  in  a  less  artificial  way. 

The  essence  of  Kant's  claim  is  that  there  can  be  no  experi- 
ence of  objects  unless  judgement  is  present  as  well  as  intuition, 
and  that  judgement  as  such  makes  certain  demands  upon 
intuition.  Judgement  demands  not  only  that  our  intuitions 
must  have  synthetic  unity,  but  that  this  synthetic  unity  must 
have  certain  definite  characteristics,  or  in  other  words,  that  the 
given  manifold,  whatever  be  its  nature,  must  be  combined 
in  certain  definite  ways.  I  will  try  to  put  these  demands  in  a 
more  plausible  way  without  reference  to  the  logical  table  of  the 
forms  of  judgement.1 

In  the  first  place  judgement  demands  a  plurality  of  homo- 
geneous units  which  can  be  thought  as  a  totality.  This  demand 
seems  to  be  involved  in  conception  as  such;  for  a  concept 

1  Compare  Chapters  X  §  5  and  XIV  §  8. 
VOL.   I  S* 


554       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  3 

must  have  different  instances  which  can  be  taken  together 
to  form  a  class.1 

In  the  second  place  judgement  demands  that  it  should  be 
able  to  affirm  and  to  deny,  and  thereby  to  delimit.  Both  affirma- 
tion and  denial  are  essential  to  judgement;  and  we  cannot 
clearly  understand  an  affirmative  judgement  till  we  know  what 
it  is  intended  to  deny,  nor  can  we  clearly  understand  a  negative, 
judgement  till  we  know  what  it  is  intended  to  affirm. 

In  the  third  place  judgement  demands  something  to  Jthink 
about ;  that  is  to  say  it  demands  a  subject  which  is  distinct  from 
predicates.  It  also  demands  a  reason  or  ground;  for  it  does  not 
profess  to  make  merely  arbitrary  statements.  Finally  it  demands 
that  objects  shall  be  of  such  a  character  as  will  enable  us  to 
apply  to  them  concepts  which  mutually  exclude  and  mutually 
determine  one  another  in  a  system;2  and  this  means,  on  Kant's 
view,  that  the  objects  themselves  must  mutually  exclude  and 
mutually  determine  one  another  in  a  system. 

In  the  fourth  place  the  fact  that  judgements  must  be  possible, 
actual,  and  necessary  demands,  according  to  Kant,  that  objects 
of  judgement  must  also  have  a  corresponding  possibility, 
actuality,  and  necessity. 

If  we  put  Kant's  doctrine  in  this  way,  it  begins  to  have 
an  air  of  greater  plausibility,  and  it  offers  us  a  more  satisfactory 
account  of  what  may  reasonably  be  called  the  necessary  form 
(or  forms)  of  thought.  We  may  feel  doubt  as  to  the  truth,  and 
even  the  meaning,  of  some  of  these  assertions  ;3  but  it  seems 
reasonable  enough  to  assume  that  judgement  as  such  does 
make  definite  demands  upon  the  given  manifold,  and  that  these 
demands  must  be  satisfied  if  there  is  to  be  knowledge  or 
experience  of  objects.  In  essence  these  demands  amount  to 

1  I  pass  over  difficulties  about  the  concepts  which  can  have  only 
one  instance. 

2  This  is  true  of  concepts  not  merely  in  the  disjunctive  judgement, 
but  in  all  affirmation  and  negation.  To  say  'This  house  is  red*  implies 
that  it  is  not  another  colour. 

3  It  is  not  clear  at  the  present  stage  how  these  demands  of  thought 
are  to  be  interpreted  when  they  are  directed  to  a  given  manifold 
of  sense. 


XXX  §  4]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        555 

this — that  the  manifold  must  be  combined  (or  be  capable 
of  being  combined)  in  accordance  with  certain  principles  of 
synthesis  involved  in  judgement  as  such.  To  recognise  this 
general  possibility  is  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  the  Trans- 
cendental Deduction. 

•§  4.  *The  Subjective  and  Objective  Sides  of  the  Deduction 

The  pure  categories  are  the  principles1  of  synthesis  which 
are  present  in  judgement  as  such,  and  in  accordance  with 
which  the  given  manifold  must  be  combined  if  there  is  to  be 
•knowledge  of  objects.  If  we  consider  the  categories  in  abstrac- 
tion from  their  relation  to  the  given  manifold  of  sense,  they 
are  mere  forms  of  judgement:  it  is  only  as  somehow  determining 
the  nature  of  a  given  manifold  that  they  can  be  regarded 
as  categories.  They  are  none  the  less  pure  categories;  for  they 
spring  only  from  the  nature  of  judgement,  and  they  are  in  no 
way  derived  from  the  nature  of  the  given  manifold  which 
is  said  to  be  combined  in  conformity  with  them. 

The  argument  so  far  maintains  only  that  certain  definite 
principles  of  synthesis  are  necessarily  involved  in  judgement 
as  such,  and  that  the  combination  of  the  given  manifold  must 
conform  to  these  principles,  if  there  is  to  be  any  object  of 
experience ;  for  there  can  be  no  experience  apart  from  judge- 

1  Kant  regards  the  pure  categories  also  as  pure  acts  of  synthesis 
present  in  judgement  as  such  and  determining  the  combination  of 
the  manifold  for  us.  Such  pure  acts  take  place  in  accordance  with 
principles  of  synthesis;  and  when  we  conceive  the  common  nature 
of  these  acts,  we  conceive  the  principles  of  synthesis  in  accordance 
with  which  the  acts  take  place.  By  describing  the  categories  as  pure 
acts  Kant  makes  it  clear  that  the  categories  are  at  work  in  all  experience 
whether  we  conceive  them  clearly  or  not.  But  principles  of  synthesis 
can  be  at  work  in  experience  even  when  we  do  not  conceive  them, 
and  it  seems  to  me  unsatisfactory  to  describe  the  categories  as  pure 
acts;  for  they  are  really  the  principles  of  synthesis  manifested  in 
judgement  so  far  as  judgement  is  a  pure  act,  that  is,  an  act  which 
has  principles  not  derived  from  the  nature  of  the  manifold  judged. 

There  is  a  further  ambiguity  inasmuch  as  the  categories  are  some- 
times spoken  of  as  principles  of  synthesis  and  sometimes  as  the  concepts 
of  these  principles.  This  usage  appears  to  me  to  be  a  natural  one, 
and  I  do  not  think  it  necessary  to  use  two  words  to  mark  the  distinction. 


556       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  4 

ment.  This  argument  may  be  called  the  objective  side  of  the 
Transcendental  Deduction ;  and  if  we  are  to  estimate  it  justly, 
we  must  be  absolutely  clear  about  its  limitations. 

Thus  we  must  not  suppose  that  Kant  imagines  himself 
to  have  made  clear  the  characteristics1  which  objects  must  have 
if  they  conform  to  the  pure  categories;  nor  indeed  has  he 
explained  how  objects  can,  and  must,  conform  to  theni.  He. 
has  shown  merely  that  unless  the  manifold  is  combined  in 
accordance  with  the  pure  categories,  there  can  be  for  ys  no 
objects  of  experience.  He  always  insists  that  apart  from  the 
forms  of  space  and  time  the  categories  are  empty:  we  can 
neither  show  what  they  mean  as  applied  to  objects,  nor  can  we 
show  that  there  must  be  objects  to  which  they  apply.  In  order 
to  do  this  in  detail  we  must  follow  the  whole  argument  in  the 
Analytic  of  Principles;  but  we  can  explain  generally  how 
objects  can,  and  must,  conform  to  the  principles  of  synthesis 
contained  in  the  pure  categories,  if  we  examine  the  transcen- 
dental synthesis  of  imagination.  This  task  belongs  to  the 
subjective  side  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  and  it  seems 
to  me  to  be  necessary  for  the  understanding  of  Kant's  argu- 
ment.2 

To  put  the  matter  in  another  way — it  might  be  a  mere 
accident  whether  appearances  conformed  to  the  categories 
or  not.  No  doubt  if  they  did  not  conform,  we  should  cease 
to  have  experience;  but  in  that  case  so  much  the  worse 
for  us.  So  far  as  the  argument  has  gone  at  present,  the  con- 
formity of  appearances  to  the  categories  must  indeed  have 
occurred ;  for  there  has  been  such  a  thing  as  human  experi- 
ence. That  conformity  might,  however,  have  been  due  to 
a  pre-established  harmony  arranged  by  the  beneficence  of 
God;  and  any  view  of  this  type  is  emphatically  rejected  by 
Kant. 

We  can  understand  how  the  manifold  must  conform  to  the 

1  At  present,  for  example,  we  are  not  entitled  to  speak  of  permanent 
substances  with  accidents  nor  of  causes  and  effects. 

2  This  appears  to  be  Kant's  own  view  in  the  second  edition,  though 
not  in  the  first. 


XXX  §  4]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        557 

categories  only  when  we  remember  that  the  appearances  given 
to  our  senses  are  not  things  as  they  are  in  themselves,  but 
things  as  they  must  appear  to  our  senses.  In  particular  they 
must  be  given  to  us  under  the  forms  of  time  and  space ;  and 
time  and  space  are  due  solely  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility. 
Kant  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be  sufficiently  explicit  on  this 
point,  but  I  take  him  to  maintain  that  the  manifold  of  time 
and  space,  because  it  is  pure  and  homogeneous  and  dependent 
on  our  sensibility,  cannot  be  recalcitrant  to  the  principles 
of  synthesis  demanded  by  the  nature  of  our  thought.1  Time 
%and  space  must  conform  to  that  demand  for  synthetic  unity 
which  is  the  most  ultimate  and  general  demand  of  thought ;  and 
unless  they  did  so,  the  unity  of  thought  (or  the  unity  of  apper- 
ception) would  be  impossible.  There  must  be  only  one  time 
and  one  space,  and  to  this  ultimate  necessity  the  combination 
of  the  given  manifold  must  conform. 

This  is  all  the  more  certain  on  Kant's  view,  because  he 
believes  that  there  is  no  combination  (or  at  least  no  objective 
combination)  in  the  manifold  apart  from  the  synthesis  of 
imagination,2  and  that  the  synthesis  of  the  empirical  manifold 
must  necessarily  be  also  a  synthesis  of  the  pure  manifold 
of  time  and  space.  The  empirical  manifold  must  therefore  possess 
such  synthetic  unity  as  is  necessary  for  it  to  have  a  definite  position 
in  one  time  and  space. 

This  very  general  conclusion  is  the  result  of  the  Transcen- 
dental Deduction  on  its  subjective  side.  We  can  now  under- 
stand not  only  that  the  empirical  manifold  must  possess  the 
synthetic  unity  demanded  by  thought,  if  we  are  to  have  experi- 
ence of  objects:  we  can  also  understand  how  it  must  do  so 

1  At  the  very  least  he  holds  that  because  the  manifold  of  time  and 
space  is  pure,  we  are  able  to  understand  a  priori  how  the  principles 
governing  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  necessarily  con- 
form to  the  principles  of  synthesis  present  in  judgement  as  such. 
Compare  also  Chapter  XXXIV  §  3. 

2  I  would  insist  again  this  does  not  mean  that  the  mind  is  by  itself 
the  source  of  empirical  differences,  such  as  that  between  a  chair 
and  a  table.  It  is  the  source  only  of  what  is  common  to  chairs  and 
tables  and  all  other  objects. 


558       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  5 

under  the  actual  conditions  of  human  experience,  namely, 
the  forms  of  space  and  time  and  the  transcendental  synthesis 
of  imagination. 

If  this  were  the  whole  of  Kant's  doctrine,  it  would  still  seem 
to  be  of  relatively  minor  importance.  The  value  of  the  argument 
depends  upon  the  total  background  of  his  thought.  As  we  shall 
see  in  the  sequel,  Kant  argues,  whether  successfully  or  not/ 
that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  which  main- 
tains the  unity  of  time  and  space  necessarily  imposes  on  the 
empirical  manifold  certain  principles  of  combination  which 
accord  with  the  principles  of  synthesis  present  in  judgement 
as  such.  Only  when  we  have  followed  the  whole  argument  can 
we  understand  in  detail  how  the  given  manifold  must  conform 
to  the  pure  categories.  When  we  understand  this,  we  shall 
also  understand  how  the  pure  categories  acquire  a  definite 
content  by  being  schematised  with  reference  to  time  and  space. 
We  shall  understand,  for  example,  how  the  given  manifold 
must  be  governed  by  cause  and  effect,  and  so  must  conform 
to  the  demand  of  thought  for  grounds  and  consequents;  for 
a  cause  is  merely  a  ground  which  precedes  its  consequent 
in  time. 

In  the  Transcendental  Deduction  Kant  is  dealing  only  with 
the  general  principles  of  his  long  and  elaborate  proof.  To  take 
the  Transcendental  Deduction  as  complete  in  itself,  and  still 
worse  to  take  it  as  a  series  of  separate  arguments  each  of  which 
is  complete  in  itself,  is  to  miss  that  synoptic  view  of  the  whole 
Critical  position  without  which  Kant's  argument  must  inevit- 
ably seem  perverse  and  unintelligible. 

§5.  The  Nature  of  Kant's  Argument 

There  is  a  real  danger  that  amid  the  intricacies  of  Kant's 
exposition  we  may  be  unable  to  see  the  general  character 
of  his  argument.  As  he  never  ceases  to  insist,  he  is  attempting 
throughout  to  determine  the  necessary  conditions  of  experience 
as  such,  and  to  argue  from  these  conditions  to  the  necessary 
characteristics  of  objects. 


XXX  §  s]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        559 

We  must  not  suppose  from  this  that  his  arguments  are 
merely  circular.  He  does  not,  for  example,  argue  that  because 
cause  and  effect  are  everywhere  assumed  in  experience,  there- 
fore causality  is  a  condition  of  experience,  and  therefore 
all  objects  must  conform  to  causal  law.  Such  a  simplification 
of  his  doctrine  would  be  the  merest  travesty. 

K'ant  finds  his  starting-point,  as  we  all  must,  in  the  human 
experience  which  we  actually  possess.  He  maintains — and 
surely  with  justice — that  experience  involves  the  co-operation 
of  sensuous  intuition  and  discursive  thought.  In  the  Aesthetic 
he  has  argued  that  space  and  time  are  the  forms  of  our  in- 
tuition and  are  due  to  the  nature  of  our  sensibility.  In  the 
Analytic  he  argues  that  thought  also  has  its  own  forms; 
that  these  forms  are  principles  of  synthesis  whose  nature  and 
number  can  be  specified ;  and  that  a  manifold  combined  in  one 
time  and  space  must  be  combined  in  accordance  with  these 
principles  of  synthesis.  The  forms  of  thought  may  be  regarded 
as  pure  categories  in  so  far  as  they  are  believed  to  imply  that 
the  given  manifold  must  be  combined  in  accordance  with 
them,  if  we  are  to  have  knowledge  of  objects. 

The  question  then  arises  in  what  sense  we  can  regard  our 
knowledge  of  the  pure  categories  as  a  priori  knowledge. 

There  is  no  doubt  that  Kant  is  repudiating  claims  which 
had  been  made  for  a  priori  knowledge  in  the  past.  He  does  not 
believe  that  the  categories  play  any  part  in  a  divine  experience ; 
and  he  admits  that  time  and  space  need  play  no  part  in  other 
finite  experiences.  But  to  hold  this  is  not  to  abolish  all  distinc- 
tion between  the  empirical  and  the  a  priori.  It  is  rather  to  make 
the  distinction  itself  more  reasonable  and  the  claims  of  human 
thought  less  arrogant. 

There  is  at  least  a  relative  difference  between  the  empirical 
and  the  a  priori  within  human  experience  itself;  and  it  appears 
to  me  that  if  any  knowledge  is  in  any  sense  a  priori,  then  we 
have  a  priori  knowledge  (i)  that  there  can  be  no  human  ex- 
perience without  the  co-operation  of  sense  and  thought; 
(2)  that  human  thought  must  make  use  of  concepts,  must 
affirm  and  deny  and  thereby  delimit,  must  have  a  subject  for 


560       THE  TRANSCENDENTAL   DEDUCTION      [XXX  §  5 

its  predicates,  and  so  on  -,1  and  (3)  that  if  the  manifold  of  sense 
did  not  conform  to  these  conditions,  there  could  be  no  thought 
and  no  experience  for  us. 

In  this  argument  Kant  first  of  all  isolates  the  factor  of 
thought  which  he  believes  to  be  necessary  for  experience; 
he  then  finds  in  thought  certain  necessary  principles  of  syn- 
thesis; and  finally  he  concludes  that  if  experience  is  tb  be. 
possible,  the  given  manifold  must  be  combined  in  such  a  way 
as  to  conform  to  these  principles  of  synthesis.  , 

This  procedure  seems  to  me  perfectly  rational,  and  I  have 
no  sympathy  with  the  criticisms  which  suggest  that  Kant  made 
a  mistake  in  attempting  to  consider  thought  in  abstraction  from 
the  other  elements  in  experience.2  It  is  precisely  this  separation 
which  gives  plausibility  to  his  argument.  We  must  grasp  the 
internal  necessity  of  synthesis  for  thought  by  itself,  and  only 
so  can  we  understand  that  the  pure  categories  must  be  necessary 
conditions  of  experience.  Similarly  it  was  only  because  we 
found  an  internal  necessity  in  time  and  space  by  themselves 
that  we  were  justified  in  regarding  them  as  forms  or  conditions 
of  sensuous  intuition.3 

Unfortunately  Kant  has  too  much  confidence  in  Formal 
Logic  to  explain  the  Idea  or  the  systematic  principle  which 
underlies  his  account  of  the  forms  of  judgement  and  the 
categories.  It  does  not  appear  to  me  to  be  enough  to  say  merely 
that  they  are  found  by  an  analysis  of  the  nature  of  judgement 
as  such.  I  need  hardly  add  that  if  we  attempt  to  free  Kant's 
argument,  as  I  have  done,  from  its  associations  with  Formal 

1  Compare  §  3  above.  We  need  not  here  insist  on  the  correctness 
of  these  details.  It  is  sufficient  if  we  can  accept  the  general  possibility 
and  go  on  to  see  how  Kant  works  out  the  details  later. 

2  This  view  is  particularly  prominent  in  Caird,  and  is  bound  up 
with  the  belief  that  Kant  considered  thought  in  abstraction  to  be 
purely  analytic — an  error  so  profound  that  it  makes  the  under- 
standing of  the  Deduction  impossible.  Caird 's  exposition  is  valuable 
when  it  yields  to  the  influence  of  the  actual  words  in  the  Kritik,  and 
so  breaks  away  temporarily  from  this  curious  doctrine;  but  unfortu- 
nately he  keeps  pulling  himself  back  to  his  central  error  at  the  very 
moments  when  his  just  and  sympathetic  mind  is  on  the  point  of  seeing 
the  truth.  8  See  Chapter  VII  §  4. 


XXX  §  6]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        561 

Logic,  we  ought  to  show  not  only  that  each  of  these  forms 
of  thought  or  principles  of  synthesis  is  involved  in  judgement 
as  such :  we  ought  also  to  show  that  they  are  derived  from  one 
principle,  and  that  they  constitute  a  system  such  that  nothing 
can  be  added  and  nothing  taken  away. 

§  6.  •  The  Copernican  Revolution 

I  have  assumed  so  far  that  we  can  have  a  priori  knowledge 
of  certain  principles  of  synthesis  involved  in  judgement  as  such. 
Such  an  assumption  seems  to  me  to  be  justified  whatever 
be  our  exact  theory  about  the  details.  Nevertheless  the  question 
inevitably  arises  why  we  can  be  assumed  to  have  a  priori 
knowledge  of  the  nature  of  human  thought,  but  not  to  have 
a  priori  knowledge  about  the  nature  of  the  physical  world. 
Kant  always  seems  to  take  it  for  granted  that  a  priori  knowledge 
of  the  former  kind  requires  no  explanation,  while  a  priori 
knowledge  of  the  latter  kind  can  be  justified  only  if  it  is  shown 
to  follow  from  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  the  mind. 
This  is  in  fact  the  essence  of  his  Copernican  revolution. 

Thus  it  might  seem  that  we  have  a  priori  knowledge  in 
regard  to  bodies ;  for  example,  we  know  that  a  body  must  have 
shape  and  extension  and  perhaps  impenetrability.1  If  so,  we 
may  reasonably  ask  ourselves  why  such  knowledge  is  on 
a  different  footing  from  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  thought. 
Kant  would,  I  think,  hold  that  we  have  such  a  priori  know- 
ledge of  bodies,  but  would  regard  this  knowledge  as  analytic;2 
and  he  maintains  that  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge  of  bodies — 
such  as  we  have  in  the  Principles3 — is  possible  only  if  space 

1  We  cannot  dismiss  such  knowledge  as  resulting  merely  from  the 
convention  that  we  do  not  call  anything  a  body  except  when  it  has 
these  characteristics;  for  we  recognise  that  there  is  a  necessary  con- 
nexion between  shape  and  extension,  and  it  is  hard  to  see  how  any 
thing  could  be  impenetrable  unless  it  had  both  extension  and  shape. 

2  Compare  A  106.  B  11-12  suggests  that  such  knowledge  is  analytic 
judgement. 

8  This  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge  is  the  condition  of  our  knowing 
bodies  empirically,  and  so  is  the  condition  of  these  empirical  concepts 
(such  as  'body')  by  the  analysis  of  which  we  can  proceed  to  make 
analytic  judgements. 


562        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXX  §  6 

and  time  are  the  forms  of  sensibility  and  if  the  categories 
originate  in  our  understanding.1  We  can  have  synthetic  a  priori 
knowledge  (and  for  the  present  purpose  this  is  the  only  kind 
of  a  priori  knowledge  we  need  consider) — we  can  have  synthetic 
a  priori  knowledge  only  of  those  characteristics  of  bodies 
which  are  contributed  by  the  mind  itself. 

This  doctrine  Kant  appears  to  regard  as  obvious.  It'  has. 
perhaps  a  certain  obviousness  as  against  the  English  em- 
piricists. If  we  consider  the  mind  as  merely  passive,  as  a  tabula 
rasa  upon  which  impressions  are  made  successively  from 
without,  it  certainly  looks  as  if  all  a  priori  knowledge  were 
impossible.  We  could  perhaps  say  that  all  things  hitherto 
experienced  had  possessed  certain  common  characteristics,2 
but  we  could  never  say  that  they  must  do  so.  This  doctrine 
is  present  already  in  Leibniz,3  and  to  some  extent  in  Plato. 

If  this  were  all  that  could  be  said,  Kant's  theory  would 
be  open  to  the  objection  that  there  are  other  possibilities 
to  be  considered.  Moreover  Kant  does  not,  as  does  Leibniz, 
maintain  that  knowledge  of  necessary  truths  depends  only  on 
the  activity  of  the  mind.  He  does  indeed  hold  that  the  activity 
of  the  mind  in  thinking  is  the  ultimate  source  of  certain  prin- 
ciples of  synthesis  in  accordance  with  which  the  given  mani- 
fold must  be  combined ;  and  consequently  that  our  knowledge 
of  the  mind's  activity  enables  us  to  have  a  priori  knowledge 
of  objects.  This  general  view  he  may,  I  think,  be  said  to  share 
with  Leibniz ;  but  he  also  holds  a  view  peculiar  to  himself — that 
we  can  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  space  and  time  as  forms  of 
sensibility,  that  is,  as  contributed  by  the  mind  on  its  passive  side* 

1  It  is  only  on  this  supposition  that  we  can  know  the  necessary 
connexion  of  shape,  extension,  and  any  other  characteristics  in  bodies. 

2  Even  this  we  could  not  do  without  holding  the  past  and  present 
together  before  us  in  one  act.  Furthermore  we  could  not  possibly 
have  knowledge  of  'things'. 

8  I  am  not  concerned  with  the  origin  of  Kant's  doctrine,  but  it  is 
astonishing  how  much  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction  can  be  found 
in  germ  in  the  earlier  chapters  of  the  Nouveaux  Essais. 

4  It  must,  however,  be  remembered  that  space  and  time  can  be 
pure  intuitions  only  through  active  synthesis;  there  is  no  a  priori 
knowledge  apart  from  the  activity  of  the  mind. 


XXX  §  6]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        563 

Kant's  doctrine  as  a  whole  therefore  seems  to  rest,  not  upon 
the  assumption  that  the  mind  can  have  a  priori  knowledge  only 
of  its  own  activity,1  but  upon  the  assumption  that  it  can  have 
a  priori  knowledge  only  of  its  own  nature  and  of  what  it  con- 
tributes out  of  its  own  nature  to  any  known  reality  which  is 
other  than  itself. 

Kant's  claim  that  the  mind  has  a  priori  knowledge  of  its  own 
nature  is  strictly  limited.  He  never  claims  that  when  we  con- 
sid^"  our  own  sensibility,  we  can  see  a  priori  that  it  must  have 
the  two  forms  of  time  and  space,  no  more  and  no  less ;  but  he 
does  claim  that  when  we  consider  our  understanding  we  can 
see  a  priori  that  it  must  have  certain  forms  or  functions,  no 
more  and  no  less.2  Thus  in  the  Analytic  he  begins  with  a  priori 
knowledge  of  the  forms  of  our  own  thought  and  argues  from 
this  to  the  categorial  characteristics  of  objects.  In  the  Aesthetic 
he  begins  with  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  space  and  time,  and 
argues  that  such  knowledge  can  be  a  priori  only  if  space  and 
time  are  forms  of  sensibility. 

Hence  although  Kant  believes  that  what  reason  produces 
from  itself  cannot  be  concealed,3  this  does  not  appear  to  be 
the  only,  or  even  the  primary  ground,  for  the  Copernican 
revolution ;  and  we  ought  never  to  forget  that  he  arrived  at  his 
Copernican  revolution  by  a  consideration  of  time  and  space,  not 
by  a  consideration  of  the  categories.4  Kant's  central  argument 
seems  rather  to  run  along  the  following  lines.  We  come  to  know 
a  priori  ideas,  like  all  other  ideas,  only  through  experience,  yet 

1  Compare  Croce's  view  that  the  mind  can  know  only  what  it  does. 

2  It  is  true  that  in  B  145-6  Kant  places  the  categories  on  precisely 
the  same  level  as  time  and  space,  and  ascribes  the  categories  to  a 
peculiarity'  (Eigentumlichkeit)  of  our  understanding.  This  does  not 
seem  to  me  to  express  his  ordinary  view.  He  usually  assumes  that  all 
finite  thinking  must  be  by  means  of  our  human  categories,  although 
not  all  finite  sensibility  need  involve  the  forms  of  time  and  space.

4  This  always  seems  to  me  surprising ;  for  the  doctrines  of  Leibniz 
lead  up  to  Kant's  view  of  the  categories,  not  to  his  view  of  space  and 
time.  Furthermore  the  argument,  granted  Kant's  assumptions,  seems 
more  plausible  in  regard  to  the  categories  than  it  does  in  regard  to 
space  and  time. 


564        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXX  §  6 

when  we  are  once  consciously  aware  of  such  ideas,  we  can  find 
in  them  an  element  of  necessity,  and  thereby  we  can  increase 
our  a  priori  knowledge.  The  fact  that  we  can  increase  our 
a  priori  knowledge  in  complete  independence  of  experience,1 
and  that  this  a  priori  knowledge  nevertheless  must  apply 
to  objects  of  experience  is,  he  believes,  a  clear  proof  that  what 
we  are  dealing  with  must  be  due,  not  to  the  nature  of  inde- 
pendent things,  but  to  the  nature  of  our  own  minds. 

It  is  the  double  character  of  a  priori  knowledge,  (i)  as  capable 
of  being  extended  independently  of  experience,  and  (2)  as 
necessarily  applying  to  objects  of  experience — it  is  this  double 
character  which  Kant  believes  to  be  intelligible  only  if  we 
accept  the  Copernican  revolution;2  and  the  necessity  of  such 
a  revolution  is  confirmed  for  Kant  by  the  fact  that  if  we  take 
an  empirical  concept,  which  is  derived  from  experience  by 
mere  abstraction,  we  can  never  by  any  kind  of  thinking  either 
extend  our  knowledge  of  the  concept  or  acquire  any  further 
knowledge  of  the  objects  to  which  it  applies.3 

Our  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  forms  of  thought,  or  of  the 
principles  of  synthesis  necessarily  present  in  thinking,  is  in 
this  respect  parallel  to  our  knowledge  of  space  and  time.  Our 
knowledge  of  the  forms  of  thought  enables  us  to  extend  our 
knowledge  independently  of  experience;  for  it  enables  us  to 
say,  not  only  what  the  common  character  of  all  judgements 
must  be,  but  also  what  are  the  ultimate  principles  of  synthesis 
to  which  any  possible  object  of  experience  must  conform.  Such 
a  priori  knowledge  is,  it  is  true,  vague  and  shadowy  when 
it  is  directed  to  objects  of  experience ;  but  it  will  become  precise 
and  definite  when  we  work  out  the  implications  of  applying 

1  We  do  this  both  in  pure  mathematics  and  in  Kant's  own  Critical 
Philosophy,  though  in  the  latter  case  only  by  reference  to  the  form 
(or  the  possibility)  of  experience. 

2  Compare  Chapters  VII  §  4  and  VIII  §  4.  Leibniz,  I  believe,  also 
accepted  these  principles,  though  he  failed  to  draw  the  conclusion 
that  we  can  know  things  only  as  appearances  and  not  as  things -in- 
themselves. 

8  We  can  analyse  the  concept  and  make  it  more  distinct,  but  this 
does  not  extend  our  knowledge. 


XXX  §  7]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        565 

these  principles  of  synthesis  to  the  pure  manifold  of  space 
and  time. 

§  7.  Difficulties  in  Kanfs  view 

Kant's  procedure  seems  to  me  consistent,  but  it  does  not 
really  meet  the  difficulty  I  have  raised,  namely,  why  our 
admittedly  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  forms  of  appearances 
should  require  explanation,  while  our  admittedly  a  priori 
knowledge  of  the  forms  of  thought  should  require  no  ex- 
planation. 

Consider  first  space  and  time  as  forms  of  appearances  or 
intuitions,  using  'appearance'  and  'intuition'  in  a  neutral 
sense  which  does  not  commit  us  to  the  Copernican  revolution. 

Granted  that  we  perceive  spatial  and  temporal  relations 
in  the  given,  why  should  we  not  be  able  to  abstract  from  the 
given  the  system  of  spatial  and  temporal  relations;  and  why 
should  we  not  be  able  both  to  recognise  the  necessity  which 
governs  that  system  of  relations  throughout  and  to  understand 
that  this  necessary  system  of  relations  is  a  condition  of  all 
given  appearances?  Or  rather — since  Kant  maintains  that  we 
can  do  these  things — why  should  we  maintain  that  our  a  priori 
knowledge  of  this  system  is  intelligible  only  if  the  system 
itself  is  imposed  upon  the  given  manifold  by  the  nature  of  our 
sensibility  ? l 

In  the  case  of  thought  we  become  aware  by  reflexion  of 
certain  principles  of  synthesis  which  are  present  in  judge- 
ment ;  we  abstract  these  principles  of  synthesis ;  and  we  claim 
to  recognise  their  necessity  as  forms  or  conditions  of  judge- 
ment and  as  principles  of  synthesis  to  which  all  objects  of 
experience  must  conform.  Why  should  we  accept  our  know- 
ledge of  the  forms  of  judgement  as  self-explanatory,  whereas 
in  the  case  of  space  and  time  we  require  to  go  behind  our 
knowledge  and  to  offer  an  explanation  for  it  ?  2 

1  Compare  Chapter  VIII  §§  4-6. 

2  The  most  formidable  criticisms  of  this  view  of  Kant's  in  regard 
to  space  and  time  are  to  be  found  in  Prichard,  Kant's    Theory  of 
Knowledge. 


566        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXX  §  7 

Kant  seems  to  believe  that  if  finite  minds  are  to  obtain 
knowledge  of  a  reality  independent  of  themselves,  they  must 
be  affected  passively  from  without.  The  mere  fact  that  reality 
is  assumed  to  be  independent  of  the  human  mind  means  that 
if  it  is  to  be  known  as  it  is  in  itself,  it  must  reveal  itself  to 
a  mind  which  in  such  knowledge  is  completely  passive  and  may 
be  described  as  a  tabula  rasa\  and  this  in  turn  means  for 'him 
that  the  knowledge  in  question  must  be  empirical.1 

There  is  some  initial  plausibility  in  this  view,  but  it  does 
not  meet  the  objection  that  the  mind  might  still  be  active 
in  abstracting  or  isolating  the  system  of  relations  and  in  under- 
standing the  necessity  of  the  system.  Such  an  activity  need  not 
impose  or  alter  the  character  of  the  system  which  is  isolated 
and  understood. 

When  we  turn  to  consider  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  thought, 
there  is,  I  think,  an  element  of  truth  in  the  view  that  in  some 
ways  thinking  is  specially  intelligible  to  itself.  No  doubt  in 
thinking  about  our  thought,  the  thought  which  we  think  about 
is  other  than  the  thought  which  thinks  about  it.  Nevertheless 
our  present  thinking  is  itself  an  example  of  what  we  are  thinking 
about.  Even  when  we  think  of  our  past  thinking,  we  can  have 
an  internal  as  well  as  an  external  view  of  it;  we  can  re-think 
it  as  well  as  think  about  it.  In  the  case  of  physical  objects  our 
view  is  wholly  external:  we  can  think  about  them,  but  we 
cannot  'enjoy'  or  re-create  their  experience — indeed  we 
commonly  believe  that  they  have  no  experience  to  be  enjoyed 
or  re-created.2 

There  are  certainly  important  differences  in  the  two  cases 
we  have  considered — notably  the  fact  that  what  I  have  called 
the  system  of  spatial  (or  temporal)  relations  looks  uncommonly 
like  an  individual  thing,  while  the  system  of  forms  of  thought 
does  not  look  in  the  least  like  an  individual  thing.  This  is  one 

1  I  think  he  really  believes  also  that  it  implies  a  theory  of  representa- 
tive idealism  such  that  while  we  might  have  faith  that  our  ideas  were 
exact  copies  of  things-in-themselves,  we  could  not  have  knowledge. 

2 1  have  discussed  this  point  in  The  Idea  of  the  Self,  University  of 
California  Publications,  Vol.  8,  1926,  pp.  73  ff. 


XXX  §  8]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION        567 

of  the  reasons  why  Kant  attributes  our  knowledge  of  space  and 
time,  not  to  thought,  but  to  intuition.  Yet  in  spite  of  their 
differences,  I  cannot  feel  certain  that  we  have  found  any 
conclusive  reason  for  maintaining  that  our  a  priori  knowledge 
of  space  and  time  demands  an  explanation  which  is  not  re- 
quired for  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  forms  of  thought.1 

§  8.  The  Copernican  Revolution  and  the  Categories 

Oil  the  other  hand,  the  Copernican  revolution  has  in  some 
ways  a  greater  plausibility  as  regards  the  categories  than  as 
•regards  space  and  time.  The  activity  of  thought  is  partly 
determined  by  the  nature  of  the  given,  but  it  seems  to  have 
a  nature  of  its  own  such  that  it  must  take  certain  forms,  what- 
ever be  the  nature  of  the  given.  There  is  nothing  unreasonable 
in  the  suggestion — whose  full  significance  we  have  still  to 
investigate — that  the  given  manifold  must  conform  to  the 
principles  of  synthesis  required  by  thought ;  for  without  this 
there  can  manifestly  be  no  knowledge  of  objects. 

Let  us  assume  the  Copernican  principle — which  Kant 
already  claimed  to  have  established  from  the  examination 
of  space  and  time — that  what  is  known  to  be  universal  and 
necessary  must  be  due  to  the  nature  of  the  knowing  mind. 
If  the  categories  are  universal  and  necessary — and  without  this 
they  are  not  categories — we  must  look  for  their  origin  in  the 
mind.  On  this  hypothesis  it  is  natural  to  find  their  origin,  not 
in  sense,  but  in  understanding:  we  sense  things  in  time  and 
space,  but  it  is  only  by  thought,  if  at  all,  that  we  can  know 
them  to  be  governed  by  causal  law.  If  we  look  for  the  origin 
of  the  categories  in  the  active  power  of  understanding,  we  must 
find  it  in  the  nature  of  judgement ;  for  what  the  understanding 
does  is  to  judge.  Furthermore  we  must  find  it  in  the  universal 
nature  of  judgement,  in  that  which  is  present  in  judgement 

1 1  think  Kant's  fundamental  reason  for  his  view  in  regard  to  space 
and  time  is  that  in  this  way  alone  can  we  do  justice  to  the  individuality 
of  space  and  time — unless  we  are  prepared  with  Newton  to  regard 
them  as  things-in-themselves,  and  therefore  as  a  kind  of  receptacle 
in  which  objects  are. 


568        THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXX  §  8 

whatever  be  the  character  of  the  matter  judged.  This  universal 
nature  may  properly  be  called  the  form  or  function  of  judge- 
ment, and  it  is  to  be  found  in  certain  principles  of  synthesis 
which  are  necessarily  present  in  judgement  as  such.  Kant's 
only  mistake — and  I  do  not  wish  to  minimise  its  seriousness — 
is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that  he  takes  the  table  of  the  forms 
of  judgement,  as  set  forth  in  his  version  of  Formal  Logic/ 
to  give  us  a  complete  list  of  these  principles  of  synthesis ;  and 
even  here  it  may  be  maintained  that  these  forms  of  judgement 
give  in  an  inadequate  way  some  indication  of  the  genuine 
necessities  of  thought. 

In  all  this  Kant's  procedure  is  essentially  reasonable.  The 
fact  that  we  can  no  longer  accept  the  traditional  view  of  the 
forms  of  judgement  offers  no  justification  for  asserting  that  the 
derivation  of  the  categories  from  the  forms  of  judgement 
is  merely  arbitrary,  or  that  it  springs  from  a  perverse  desire 
to  establish  connexions,  however  artificial,  between  Transcen- 
dental and  Formal  Logic. 

We  have  still  to  consider  whether  there  is  any  plausibility 
in  connecting  the  forms  of  thought  with  the  schematised  cate- 
gories; but  I  think  we  shall  find  that  the  connexion  is  not 
quite  so  artificial  as  is  commonly  supposed.  Some  philosophers 
may  be  able  to  assert  a  priori  by  an  examination  of  the  nature 
of  change,  that  every  change  is  change  in  a  permanent  sub- 
stance, and  that  every  event  must  have  a  cause.  If  they  are 
right,  there  is  manifestly  no  need  for  Kant's  Copernican 
revolution;  but  I  must  confess  that  hitherto  such  insight  has 
not  been  vouchsafed  to  me.  In  the  case  of  the  categories  of 
substance  and  cause,  if  they  are  not  to  be  set  aside  altogether 
as  useless  lumber,  it  is,  I  submit,  a  hypothesis  worthy  of 
serious  consideration  that  they  are  due  partly  to  the  demand 
of  thought  for  a  subject  of  predicates  and  a  ground  of  assertion. 
In  any  case  Kant  recognised  clearly  that  the  forms  of  judge- 
ment were  principles  of  synthesis ;  and  it  is  small  wonder  that 
when  he  was  able,  with  the  aid  of  a  little  ingenuity,  to  connect 
the  recognised  categories  with  the  forms  of  judgement,  he 
should  be  satisfied  that  his  list  was  complete.  The  congruence 


XXX  §  8]    THE  ARGUMENT  OF  THE  DEDUCTION       569 

of  the  categories  with  the  forms  of  judgement  was  not  only 
a  proof  of  the  a  priori  origin  of  the  categories  in  the  mind : 
it  was  also  a  striking  corroboration  of  the  Copernican  doctrine 
that  the  origin  of  the  universal  and  necessary  must  be  found 
in  the  nature  of  the  mind  itself. 

That  corroboration  is  for  ever  gone,  unless  we  can  substitute 
•something  better,  and  yet  similar,  for  Kant's  forms  of  judge- 
ment. In  any  case  the  completeness  and  beauty  of  his  argument 
are  permanently  impaired ;  but  we  need  not  for  that  reason  fail 
to  recognise  the  subtlety  and  ingenuity  of  his  thought. 


CHAPTER    XXXI 
THE   FACTORS    IN    EXPERIENCE 

§  i.  The  Unity  of  Apperception 

Whatever  view  we  take  about  Kant's  argument  as  a  whole, 
there  is,  I  would  suggest,  a  permanent  value  in  his  account 
of  the  different  factors  at  work  in  experience.  This  is  true* even 
when  we  have  grounds  to  complain  of  the  inadequacy  and 
obscurity  of  his  exposition;  and  I  believe  that  it  is  true  as 
regards  his  account  of  the  unity  of  apperception. 

We  know,  if  we  know  anything,  that  self-identity  is  the 
condition  of  all  knowledge,  and  that  this  self-identity  is  mani- 
fested in  the  act  of  synthesis  which  must  be  present  in  all 
thinking  and  in  all  judgement.  To  suppose  that  self-identity 
consists  either  in  a  common  constituent  of  recognised  mental 
states,  or  in  the  interrelation  between  them,  is  to  destroy  the 
very  possibility  of  knowledge.  What  is  required  for  knowledge 
is  the  unity  of  the  subject  thinking,  and  not  merely  the  unity 
of  a  particular  kind  of  object  thought.1 

This  doctrine  Kant  seems  to  me  to  have  established.  Its 
further  analysis,  as  he  himself  recognises,  is  a  matter  of  great 
difficulty.2  We  are  not  entitled  to  assume  that  the  knowing  self 
is  a  permanent  substance — a  view  he  explicitly  rejects.  The 
very  phrase  'the  unity  of  apperception'  seems  to  warn  us  that 
what  he  is  describing  is  the  unity,  not  of  a  substance,  but 
of  an  activity,  or  even  of  an  act. 

On  the  other  hand,  we  are  entitled  to  assume  that  the  activity 
of  thinking  involves  some  sort  of  self-consciousness.  Thinking 
always  implies  a  distinction  between  appearance  and  reality  and 

1  I  have  argued  this  at  greater  length  in  Mind,  Vol.  XXXVIII, 
N.S.  No.  151.  See  also  Chapter  XXI,  especially  §§4-5,  and  Chapter 
XXVIII  §  5. 

2  We  shall  have  to  consider  later  the  extremely  difficult  question 
of  the  relation  between  the  unity  of  apperception  and  inner  sense. 
See  Chapter  LII. 


XXXI  §  2]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  571 

between  truth  and  error;  and  these  distinctions  are  meaning- 
less unless  we  presuppose  a  distinction  between  the  knowing 
self  and  the  known  world.  Self-consciousness  is  therefore 
implicit  in  every  judgement;  for  every  judgement  claims  to 
know  reality  and  to  assert  truth.  This  is  borne  out  by  the  fact 
that  we  can  always  turn  back  and  reflect  about  our  thinking, 
for  to  reflect  about  thinking  is  to  be  self-conscious. 

Kant  is  also  right  in  maintaining  that  to  judge  is  to  assert 
objectivity,  and  to  affirm  at  least  the  partial  independence 
of  the  known  world.  His  double  principle  is  fundamentally 
sound:  there  is  no  known  world  apart  from  a  thinking  and 
synthetising  self;  and  there  is  no  thinking  self  and  no  self- 
consciousness  apart  from  a  known  and  synthetised  world. 

§  2.  The  Unity  of  the  Object 

The  necessary  unity  of  apperception  finds  its  counterpart 
in  the  necessary  unity  of  the  object,  and  ultimately  in  the 
necessary  unity  of  the  whole  objective  world. 

It  may  seem  that  Kant's  assertion  of  the  necessary  unity 
of  the  object  is  a  mere  begging  of  the  question,  and  that  his 
whole  argument  evades  the  difficulties  which  had  been  set 
forth  by  Hume.  I  do  not  think  that  this  criticism  is  sound. 
Kant  does  not  start  from  the  assumption  that  things  are,  and 
must  be,  wholes  of  necessarily  interrelated  parts.  He  starts, 
even  in  the  first  edition,  from  an  analysis  of  objects  as  they 
appear  to  us,  and  he  is  surely  correct  in  saying  that  our  ideas 
of  an  object  must  be  compatible  with  one  another  j1  if  they  were 
not  so  compatible,  we  should  not  regard  them  as  ideas  of  the 
same  object.  Besides,  although  Kant  leads  us  from  the  unity 
of  the  object  to  the  unity  of  apperception,  it  is  the  unity  of 
apperception  which  is  fundamental,  or  in  Kant's  language 
'original* :  the  unity  of  the  object  is  derivative.  This  is  made 
still  clearer  in  the  second  edition.2 

1 A  104. 

2  In  the  first  edition  Kant  directs  special  attention  to  the  fact  that 
all  our  knowing  takes  time,  and,  that,  in  order  to  be  aware  of  any 
object  (even  a  series  of  numbers)  which  it  takes  time  to  know,  we

§  3.  The  Synthesis  of  Imagination 

Kant  has  been  criticised  for  failing  to  recognise  sufficiently 
the  interdependence  of  thought  and  intuition,  and  for  supposing 
that  the  faculty  of  imagination  is  necessary  to  mediate  between 
them.  I  think  rather  that  it  is  his  critics  who  are  too  facile 
in  their  solution,  or  evasion,  of  the  difficulties  which  he  is 
trying  to  meet. 

The  fact  that  both  thought  and  sense,  as  Kant  fully  recog- 
nises, are  involved  in  all  knowledge  is  no  reason  for  confusing 
them:  it  is  on  the  contrary  a  good  reason  why  we  should  be 
careful  to  mark  them  off  from  one  another,  if  we  wish  to  avoid 
error.1  And  Kant's  account  of  imagination  as  having  an  inter- 
mediate place  between  thought  and  sense  is  of  permanent 
value.  Without  imagination  we  could  not  pass  beyond  the 
momentary  sensum,  and  human  understanding,  as  we  know 
it,  would  be  impossible. 

Furthermore  the  account  which  Kant  gives  of  the  synthesis 
of  imagination  as  both  empirical  and  transcendental  seems 
to  me  to  be  clearly  true.  As  we  combine  our  sensa  (in  accor- 
dance with  our  empirical  concepts  of  objects),  we  also  fill  out 
in  imagination  the  one  space  and  time  in  which  all  objects  are. 
The  one  question  which  still  awaits  an  answer  is — How  can 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  space  and  time  be  said  to  be  in 
accordance  with  the  categories  ? 

4.  Is  Synthesis  Conscious  or  Unconscious  ? 

Kant's  doctrine  of  synthesis  seems  to  me  straightforward 
and  even  simple,  but  it  has  been  subjected  to  a  great  deal 
of  destructive  criticism.  It  has  been  alleged  to  demand  a  choice 

require  imagination,  memory,  and  judgement.  In  the  second  edition 
he  begins  with  thought  considered  in  abstraction  and  insists  that 
without  thought  we  cannot  have  that  unity  of  the  manifold  of  intuition 
in  general  which  must  be  present  if  we  are  to  have  an  object:  time 
and  objects  in  time  are  considered  later.  In  both  editions  the  unity 
of  thought  is  'original*  and  the  unity  of  the  object  which  we  think 
is  'derivative'.

XXXI  §4]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  573 

between  two  alternatives.  The  syntheses1  of  which  Kant 
speaks  are  described  as  necessary  conditions  of  our  experience. 
But  if  they  are  events  which  take  place  in  our  experience,  they 
cannot,  we  are  told,  be  conditions  of  it.  On  the  other  hand, 
if  they  do  not  take  place  in  our  experience,  they  cannot  be 
known.  Hence  they  are  either  unknowable,  or  else  they  are  not 
.conditions  of  experience.  In  either  case  Kant's  whole  theory 
falls  to  the  ground.2 

Tljis  criticism  is  not,  I  think,  so  formidable  as  it  sounds. 
It  seems  to  me  to  rest  on  a  misunderstanding,  and  there  is  no 
doubt  that  Kant  would  reject  both  alternatives. 

On  the  first  view — the  view,  namely,  that  the  syntheses 
in  question  are  events  in  experience — the  Deduction  would 
be  empirical.  It  would  deal  with  the  stages  which  the  mind 
passed  through  on  its  way  from  imperfect  to  complete  know- 
ledge. It  might  establish  the  fact  that  we  make  use  of  the 
categories,  but  could  never  be  a  justification  of  such  a  use.8 
This  interpretation  Kant  has  rejected  over  and  over  again 
in  the  clearest  possible  terms;  and  in  any  case  the  fact  that 
it  makes  his  whole  theory  absurd  is  surely  a  sufficient  refutation 
of  it.  To  say  that  we  first  have  intuitions  and  then  synthetise 
them  under  the  categories,  or  that  we  first  are  aware  of  the 
categories  and  then  apply  them  to  an  indeterminate  manifold, 
is  almost  ludicrously  untrue. 

The  second  view  suggests  that  the  syntheses  are  unconscious 
or  pre-logical  syntheses  which  precede  consciousness  and, 
so  to  speak,  prepare  the  phenomenal  world  for  human  con- 
sciousness. They  have  apparently  to  work  on  raw  impressions, 
and  turn  these  into  ordered  appearances  in  space  and  time, 

1  It  makes  no  difference  whether  we  call  this  a  threefold  synthesis 
of  apprehension,  reproduction,  and  recognition,  or  whether  we  call 
it  a  figurative  synthesis  and  an  intellectual  synthesis — there  is  only 
one  synthesis  with  different  factors  at  work  in  it,  but  the  supporters 
of  this  criticism  tend  to  regard  it  as  a  series  of  syntheses. 

*  These  objections  have  been  put  very  clearly  by  Dr.  Ewing,  Kant's 
Treatment  of  Causality,  pp.  65  ff.,  but  he  does  not  see  that  the  doctrines 
in  question  arise  from  a  false  interpretation  of  Kant.  The  interpretation 
itself  has  its  origin  in  Vaihinger  and  has  been  elaborated  by  Kemp 
Smith.  8  A  86-7  =  B  119,  etc.

before  experience  can  begin.  The  whole  elaborate  machinery 
which  Kant  finds  at  work  in  experience  (and  which  must  be 
at  work  in  experience)  is  supposed  to  do  the  same  work  also 
outside  of  experience.1  The  result  of  this  could  only  be  the 
pre-established  harmony  which  Kant  consistently  rejects  when 
it  is  ascribed,  more  reasonably,  to  an  act  of  God ;  and  it  is  clear 
that  the  whole  elaborate  system  of  syntheses  which  Kant 
describes  in  detail  as  taking  place  in  time  would  be  non- 
temporal  and  ex  hypothesi  unknown  and  unknowable.  Yet  this 
fantastic  and  self-contradictory  fabrication  is  asserted  by 
Professor  Vaihinger  to  be  the  great  'etf/^a'  of  the  Transcen- 
dental Deduction.2 

What  is  there  in  Kant  to  encourage  such  an  interpretation  ? 
Little  enough.  There  is  the  loose  employment  of  the  word 
'before'  to  which  I  have  so  often  referred.  There  is  the  state- 
ment that  imagination  is  blind,  and  that  it  is  a  function  of  the 
soul  of  which  we  are  seldom  conscious.3  There  is  the  insistence 
that  the  schematism  of  the  understanding  is  a  hidden  art 
in  the  depths  of  the  human  soul ;  and  that  its  true  methods 
we  shall  hardly  ever  divine  from  nature  and  lay  open  before 
our  gaze.4  Such  contentions,  while  obviously  true,  are  far  from 
asserting  a  necessarily  unconscious,  and  still  further  from 
asserting  a  noumenal,  synthesis.  Kant's  argument  is  on  the 
contrary  that  the  synthesis  of  imagination  has  to  be  brought  to 
concepts  by  understanding,  and  it  is  only  when  it  is  so  brought 
to  concepts  that  we  can  have  knowledge.5 

1  Apparently  the  transcendental  syntheses  take  place  outside  experi- 
ence and  the  empirical  syntheses  in  experience;  but  I  cannot  see 
how  the  transcendental  syntheses  could  be  rendered  unnecessary  in 
experience  because  they  took  place  outside  it,  nor  can  I  see  how  the 
syntheses  outside  experience  could  be  transcendental  without  being 
also  empirical,  if  they  are  to  determine  empirical  objects.

5  Kant  actually  says  in  B  154  that  we  always  perceive  in  ourselves 
the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination  which  determines  the 
manifold.  His  general  view  is,  however,  that  our  awareness  of  it 
may  be  either  'obscure'  or  'clear*. 


XXXI  §  5]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  575 

To  maintain  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
(or  any  other  syntheses  or  systems  of  synthesis)  is  necessarily 
unconscious  is  to  contradict  the  very  essence  of  Kant's  argu- 
ment. The  unity  of  apperception  for  him  necessarily  implies 
at  least  potential  self-consciousness,  and  this  self-conscious- 
ness is  inseparable  from  consciousness  of  the  very  synthesis 
which  is  alleged  to  be  necessarily  unconscious.1 

§  5.  The  False  Assumptions  of  the  Dilemma 

The  two  alternatives  between  which  it  is  supposed  we  have 
to  choose  rest  mainly,  not  upon  the  evidence  of  Kant's  lang- 
uage, but  on  the  assumption  that  Kant  is  trying  to  explain  the 
genesis  of  experience.  Kant's  own  view  is  that  he  is  not  con- 
cerned with  the  question  how  experience  comes  to  be  but  with 
what  is  contained  in  experience;2  and  this  is  the  only  view 
which  will  make  his  argument  intelligible. 

What  Kant  is  doing  is  to  analyse  experience  into  matter  and 
form.3  The  matter  is  given  to  the  mind  and  the  form  is  imposed 
by  the  mind:  there  is  no  reason  for  supposing  that  either 
is  before  the  other.4  Whenever  we  know  any  object,  sense, 
imagination,  and  understanding  are  at  work  together.  Sense 
receives  the  matter  under  the  form  of  time,  imagination  organ- 
ises it  in  space  and  time  in  accordance  with  empirical  con- 
cepts and  the  categories,  and  understanding  judges  it  by  means 
of  the  same  concepts  and  categories.  I  can  see  no  ground  for 
saying  that  these  processes  succeed  one  another  in  time;  they 
are  all  elements  in  the  one  temporal  process  which  is  experi- 
ence, and  it  is  a  mere  fallacy  to  suppose  that  an  element  in 
experience  cannot  also  be  a  condition  of  experience. 

The  supposed  dilemma  with  which  we  are  confronted  seems 
to  assume  (i)  that  we  can  analyse  experience  only  into  events 
which  succeed  one  another  in  time,  and  (2)  that  a  condition 
must  precede  in  time  that  which  it  conditions.  Both  these

4  They  are  distinguishable,  but  not  separable. 


5?6      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXXI  §6 

assumptions  are  groundless.  The  transcendental  synthesis  of 
imagination  is,  not  a  separate  event,  but  a  necessary  element 
in  every  act  of  knowing  or  experiencing  an  object;  and  it  is 
a  necessary  condition  of  such  knowledge  or  experience,  although 
it  is  neither  an  earlier  event  in  time  nor  a  pre-conscious  and 
non-temporal  noumenal  act.1 

§  6.  Example  of  the  Transcendental  Synthesis 

If  we  consider  the  simplest  and  most  intelligible  form  of  the 
transcendental  synthesis,  the  synthesis  of  quantity,  there  is 
obviously  no  need  to  suppose  either  that  it  is  a  separate  event 
in  experience  or  that  it  is  necessarily  unconscious.  When  we 
follow  carefully  the  outline  of  a  house  in  order  to  determine 
its  precise  shape  or  measurements,  we  need  not  be  reflectively 
aware  of  what  we  are  doing,  but  there  is  no  great  difficulty 
in  becoming  so.  And  when  we  analyse  what  we  are  doing,  we 
find  that  we  are  not  only  synthetising  (in  accordance  with 
our  concept  of  house)  a  manifold  given  successively  in  in- 

1  For  the  sake  of  simplicity  I  confine  myself  to  the  transcendental 
synthesis  of  imagination;  but  what  I  have  said  is  equally  true  of  the 
thought  which  is  at  once  an  element  in,  and  a  condition  of,  experience. 
Thinking  is  manifestly  a  temporal  process.  Kant  himself,  speaking 
of  the  thought  of  a  mathematical  figure,  says,  'Thinking  itself,  although 
it  happens  in  time,  takes  no  account  of  time* ;  see  Acht  Kleine  Aufsdtze,  I. 
If  thinking  were  not  in  time,  how  could  our  awareness  of  our  own 
thinking  be  dependent  on  inner  sense?  Compare  A  357  and  many 
other  places. 

A  fortiori,  for  Kant  knowing  must  be  in  time.  Knowing  is  that 
whole  of  thought  and  intuition,  of  a  priori  and  empirical  factors, 
which  we  call  'experience5;  and  experience,  as  he  truly  insists,  is 
always  an  advance  in  time;  compare  A  210  =  B  255.  Yet  it  is  too 
commonly  stated  as  an  accepted  dogma  that  for  Kant  knowing  is 
timeless.  One  of  the  many  merits  of  the  Master  of  Balliol's  recent 
book  on  Kant  is  that  it  breaks  away  from  so  groundless  a  tradition. 

I  do  not  deny  that  in  the  self  as  it  is  in  itself  there  must  be  some- 
thing corresponding  to  the  successive  synthesis  which  constitutes 
experience;  just  as  in  the  thing-in-itself  there  must  be  something 
corresponding  to  the  motion  of  bodies.  But  there  is  as  little  reason 
to  call  the  first  unknown  something  a  timeless  and  noumenal  synthesis 
as  there  is  to  call  the  second  unknown  something  a  timeless  and 
noumenal  motion ;  and  there  is  as  little  ground  in  Kant  for  the  one 
as  for  the  other. 


XXXI  §  7]       THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  577 

tuition:  we  are  also  synthetising  the  pure  and  homogeneous 
manifold  of  space.1  We  do  not  first  synthetise  the  space,  and 
then  know  the  house,  but  the  synthesis  of  space  is  none  the 
less  the  condition  of  our  knowing  the  house.2 

I  do  not  suggest  that  the  synthesis  involved  in  causality  has 
the  same  charming  simplicity,  and  no  doubt  it  is  the  difficulty 
of  this  synthesis  which  gives  rise  to  the  theories  we  are  con- 
sidering. It  should,  however,  be  observed  that  the  account 
given  by  Kant  is  intended  to  apply  to  all  the  necessary  forms 
of  synthesis,  and  he  nowhere  suggests  that  these  differ  in  the 
respect  that  some  are  conscious  and  some  are  not.  Indeed 
there  is  only  one  synthesis,  although  within  it  we  can  dis- 
tinguish different  aspects. 

The  theory  that  the  transcendental  synthesis  is  necessarily 
a  pre-conscious  and  noumenal  synthesis  is  in  flat  contradiction 
to  Kant's  express  statements.  It  is  itself  fantastic  and  self- 
contradictory,  and,  in  my  opinion,  alien  to  the  whole  spirit 
of  the  Critical  Philosophy.  To  say  that  it  is  nevertheless  the 
logical  outcome  of  the  Critical  Philosophy  rests  upon  assump- 
tions which  seem  to  me  to  have  no  basis  either  in  Kant  or 
in  reality. 

§  7.  The  Development  of  Experience 

Kant  is  under  no  obligation  to  give  an  account  of  how 
experience  develops  or  how  we  come  to  be  aware  of  objects, 
and  he  nowhere  offers  us  such  an  account.  The  history  of  how 
we  come  to  know  objects  and  the  analysis  of  what  is  necessarily 
involved  in  knowing  objects  are  two  different  things. 

On  the  question  of  how  we  come  to  know  the  categories 
Kant  says  comparatively  little.  He  recognises  that  this  is  a 
matter  for  psychology,  and  he  never  denies  that  it  is  com- 
paratively late  in  our  development  before  we  become  conscious 
of  the  a  priori  principles  which  are  determining  experience 
•  throughout.

2  If  we  substitute  the  synthesis  of  substance  and  accident  the  same 
principle  holds.

5?8      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION     [XXXI  §7 

The  empirical  view  is  that  all  our  concepts  are  derived  by 
simple  generalisation  from  experience,  and  that  this  is  their 
only  justification.  If  this  is  true,  then  all  our  concepts  are 
necessarily  empirical.  If  we  hold  that  some  of  our  concepts  are 
a  priori,  we  must  look  for  another  account  of  their  origin.1 
Kant's  own  view  he  himself  compares  to  a  system  of  'epi- 
genesis'.2 

The  contemporary  theory  of  epigenesis,  as  propounded  by 
Casper  Wolff,  was  'that  the  complex  organism  of  the  adult 
is  the  result  of  a  progressive  differentiation  of  a  comparatively 
simple  embryo  in  an  appropriate  environment'.3  Kant  believes 
that  in  a  similar  way  man  is  born  with  a  power  of  thinking 
which  is  called  into  play,  and  differentiates  itself  progressively, 
as  the  senses  are  stimulated.  Thinking,  so  far  as  it  is  empirical, 
is  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  given  manifold;  but  all 
thinking,  however  empirical  it  may  be,  must  conform  to  the 
laws  of  the  understanding  itself,  of  which  the  law  of  non- 
contradiction is  the  most  obvious.  It  is  only  late  in  the  develop- 
ment of  experience  that  understanding  becomes  reflectively 
conscious  of  these  laws,  and  is  able  to  consider  them  in  them- 
selves and  to  grasp  their  necessity.  The  laws  or  forms  of 
thought  had,  on  Kant's  view,  been  stated  by  Aristotle.  It  was 
left  for  Kant  himself  to  show  how  they  must  impose  categorial 
characteristics  on  all  objects  of  knowledge,  and  how  they  are 
therefore  the  source  of  a  priori  cognitions  which  men  had 
accepted  without  being  able  to  justify.4 

Whether  Kant  is  right  or  wrong  about  the  details,  an  account 
of  this  kind  is  the  only  possible  account  of  the  general  develop- 
ment of  a  priori  knowledge :  the  details  can  be  given  only  by 
psychology.  The  account  would  have  to  be  modified  in  certain 
respects,  if  we  hold  that  we  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  things- 


1 1  would  remind  the  reader  that  the  origin  of  concepts  is  to  be 
distinguished  from  their  acquisition;  see  Chapter  XVI  §  3.

in-themselves ;  but  no  serious  thinker  maintains  that  we 
possess  conscious,  innate,  and  a  priori  ideas  before  experience 
begins. 

§8.  The  Necessity  of  Synthesis 

The  central  doctrine  of  the  Transcendental  Deduction,  and 
even  of  the  Kritik  as  a  whole,  is  the  view  that  synthesis  is 
a  necessary  factor  in  experience.  However  unpopular  this 
doctrine  may  be  at  the  present  time,1 1  believe  that  if  we  ignore 
synthesis  altogether,  there  can  be  no  adequate  account  of 
experience. 

It  is  possible,  and  indeed  necessary,  to  take  our  whole 
human  experience  as  if  it  were  something  merely  given,  and 
we  can  then  analyse  it  in  various  ways.  We  can  say  what  kinds 
of  thing  we  know  and  what  kinds  of  knowledge  we  possess. 
The  whole  of  natural  science,  very  properly,  concerns  itself 
only  with  the  kinds  of  thing  we  know,  and  endeavours  to  know 
more  of  them.  Even  the  kinds  of  knowledge  we  possess  can 
be  taken,  with  perfect  propriety,  merely  as  given,  and  can  be 
subjected  on  this  basis  to  both  psychological  and  philosophical 
analysis.  These  methods  may  perhaps  be  the  most  fruitful 
methods  of  enquiry  at  the  present  time;  and  Kant  never 
questions  the  value  of  such  methods,  nor  does  he  suggest  that 
those  who  use  them  are  acting  illegitimately  in  regarding 
objects  as  things-in-themselves.2 

Such  enquiries  do  not  touch  upon  the  Kantian  problem. 
They  neither  explain  how  synthetic  a  priori  judgements  are 
possible,  nor  set  the  limits  of  such  judgements.  They  must 
either  be  content  to  say  that  we  know,  and  know  that  we  know ; 
or  else  they  must  reduce  knowledge  of  necessity  to  tautology ; 
or  else,  finally,  they  must  cast  doubt  upon  such  knowledge 

1  Some  of  the  objections  at  least  seem  to  me  based  on  mere  mis- 
understanding. It  is  too  commonly  assumed  that  for  Kant  synthesis 
is  arbitrary.  I  hope  I  have  made  it  clear  that  this  is  not  so.  All  synthesis 
depends  upon  the  given,  and  what  the  mind  contributes  to  its  object 
is  (in  addition  to  space  and  time)  necessary  unity  and  necessary  order. 
When  this  is  ignored,  accounts  of  Kant's  view  become  mere  caricatures.

altogether,  and  discover,  by  analysis  of  experience  into  its 
given  parts,  that  there  is  no  sort  of  unity  to  connect  these 
parts.  All  these  tendencies  are  prominent  in  contemporary 
philosophy. 

If  we  are  not  content  to  consider  merely  what  are  the  kinds 
or  stages  of  human  knowledge,  we  are  forced,  it  seems  to  me, 
to  grapple  with  the  part  which  is  played  in  knowledge  by  the 
synthetic  activity  of  the  mind. 

The  plain  fact  is  that  we  can  consider  the  whole  material 
world,  and  the  whole  of  human  experience,  to  be  given  to  us 
only  because  it  is  given  through  our  own  synthesis  of  thought 
and  imagination.  What  is  given  to  us  at  any  moment  apart 
from  the  activity  of  the  mind  may  be  difficult  to  determine  by 
analysis,  and  Kant  may  have  restricted  it  unduly,  but  it  is  poor 
and  thin  and  for  ever  changing.  It  is  essentially  momentary, 
and  yet  we  know  it  as  momentary  only  because  we  synthetise 
the  past  and  the  present.  It  is  in  time,  but  the  time  in  which 
it  is  is  not  given  to  mere  sense;  for  the  time  which  can  be 
regarded  as  given  to  sense  is  only  the  present  moment,1  and 
even  that  is  known  as  a  moment  only  because  we  synthetise 
it  with  past  time,  which  is  no  longer  given.  On  this  narrow 
and  continually  changing  basis  we  build  up  in  thought  and 
imagination,  not  only  our  own  past  history,  but  the  history 
of  a  world  in  space  and  time,  the  temporal  order  of  which 
we  distinguish  from  the  temporal  order  of  our  knowings. 
Archimedes  claimed  that  if  he  were  given  a  point  on  which 
to  rest  a  lever  he  could  move  the  world.  We  who  are  given  a 
point,  and  a  continually  changing  point,  on  which  to  base  our 
thinking,  are  able  somehow  to  construct  a  universe.  So  long 
as  we  ignore  this  elementary  fact,  our  philosophies,  however 
valuable,  must  necessarily  be  incomplete. 

In  this  procedure  the  fact  that  we  construct  in  imagination 
the  one  time  and  space  in  which  all  things  must  be  is  of  funda- 
mental importance.  It  enables  us  to  test  the  constructions  which 
we  have  made,  and  to  distinguish  the  work  of  uncontrolled 
imagination  from  the  work  of  imagination  which  is  guided 
1  Or,  if  we  prefer  it,  the  specious  present. 


XXXI  §  9]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  58! 

by  thought.  The  transcendental  synthesis  of  imagination 
is  no  mere  fiction:  it  is  at  work  in  all  our  knowledge,  and  its 
importance  cannot  be  exaggerated.  Whether  Kant  is  right 
or  not  in  the  consequences  which  he  draws  from  its  presence, 
he  was  certainly  right  in  drawing  attention  to  the  problem, 
and  also  in  believing  that  its  solution  is  essential  to  the  under- 
standing of  our  human  experience. 

§  9^  Co-operation  of  Mind  and  Reality 

Kant's  doctrine  asserts  that  the  matter  of  experience  is  given 
to  mind  by  an  independent  reality,  while  the  form  of  experience 
is  imposed  by  the  mind  itself.  It  may  be  objected  that  such 
a  co-operation  between  mind  and  reality  is  impossible :  thought 
must  either  determine  its  object  through  and  through,  or  else 
it  must  do  nothing  but  apprehend  what  is  given.1 

I  do  not  see  why  this  should  be  so.  It  is  impossible  to  get 
a  precise  analogy  for  Kant's  view,  but  if  we  look  at  the  world 
through  blue  spectacles,  it  is  the  spectacles  which  make  the 
world  look  blue;  yet  the  spectacles  do  not  by  themselves 
determine  the  difference  in  the  shades  of  blue  belonging  to 
different  objects.2  Again,  it  is  the  constitution  of  our  eyes  and 
brain  which  determines  that  physical  bodies  shall  appear 
to  us  as  coloured ;  but  the  constitution  of  our  eyes  and  brain 
does  not  by  itself  determine  which  particular  colours  we 
shall  see. 

Similarly,  according  to  Kant,  it  is  the  constitution  of  the 
human  mind  which  makes  it  necessary  for  things  to  appear 
to  us  as  extensive  and  intensive  quantities  in  space  and  time ; 
it  is  not,  however,  in  the  power  of  the  human  mind  to  determine 
a  priori  the  particular  quantity  which  any  particular  thing 
must  appear  to  us  to  have.  More  important  still,  the  law- 
abidingness  of  nature  is,  according  to  Kant,  imposed  by  the 
mind;  but  it  is  not  the  mind  by  itself  which  can  determine 

1  Broadly  speaking,  the  former  view  is  that  of  Caird,  the  latter 
that  of  Prichard,  though  no  doubt  certain  qualifications  would  have 
to  be  added  in  both  cases.

a  priori  that  a  certain  combination  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen 
will  always  result  in  water. 

No  doubt  such  a  theory  implies  that  we  can  know  things 
only  as  they  must  appear  to  us  and  not  as  they  are  in  them- 
selves.1 That,  however,  is  precisely  what  Kant's  doctrine 
is;  and  he  believes  it  is  compatible  with  the  existence  of  a 
common  world  of  experience  which  must  be  explored  empiric- 
ally by  science,  although  we  have  a  priori  knowledge  of  its 
categorial  characteristics. 

Kant's  theory  is  certainly  full  of  difficulties,  but  so  are  the 
other  theories  to  which  his  is  opposed.  All  I  urge  is  that  his 
view  is  a  serious  alternative,  which  deserves  examination 
as  much  as  the  others,  and  is  not  to  be  condemned  off-hand 
as  obviously  self-contradictory. 

§  10.  Empirical  Realism  and  Transcendental  Idealism 

Kant's  doctrine  does  more  than  attempt  to  explain  and 
justify  our  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  phenomenal  world: 
it  also  confines  our  a  priori  knowledge,  and  indeed  all  our 
knowledge,  to  that  phenomenal  world.  The  human  mind 
according  to  Kant  can  have  knowledge  only  of  that  which  is 
given  to  it  in  sense ;  and  sense-perceptions  must  be  given  under 
the  forms  of  sensibility  (time  and  space)  and  must  be  combined 
in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  synthesis  implicit  in 

1  Prichard  appears  to  argue  that  this  is  impossible,  since  the  word 
'know'  implies  that  what  we  know  is  known  as  it  is  in  itself;  see 
Kant's  Theory  of  Knowledge  pp.  118  ff.  and  compare  pp.  20  ff.  This 
argument,  if  I  have  understood  it  properly,  is  unconvincing.  It  is 
natural  enough  that  ordinary  language  should  carry  with  it  realistic 
assumptions,  and  even  naive  realistic  assumptions.  The  question  is 
whether  further  reflexion  will  justify  such  assumptions.  Besides,  if 
we  suppose  that  the  world  is  really  coloured,  can  we  not  say  in  ordinary 
speech  that  the  colour-blind  man  knows  the  world  only  as  it  must 
appear  to  colour-blind  men? 

If  Kant  claimed  that  this  knowledge  of  the  joint  product  of  things 
and  the  mind  is  to  be  described  as  knowledge  of  the  thing-in-itself, 
Prichard *s  objection  would  no  doubt  be  valid;  but  this  is  what  Kant 
never  claims.  He  does  claim  that  we  know  the  joint  product,  or  the 
phenomenal  world,  as  it  is  and  must  be  for  any  human  mind ;  and  I 
cannot  see  why  this  should  not  be  described  as  knowledge. 


XXXI  §  10]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  583 

thought.  If  so,  it  is  clear  that  while  we  can  have  knowledge, 
and  a  priori  knowledge,  of  things  as  they  must  appear  to 
human  minds,  we  have  no  reason  whatever  to  regard  such 
knowledge  as  knowledge  of  things  as  they  are  in  themselves ; 
and  we  can  have  no  hope  of  attaining  any  other  type  of  know- 
ledge than  that  which  we  possess. 

Such  in  effect  is  the  result  of  Kant's  transcendental  idealism. 
We  must  not  forget  that  at  the  same  time  it  enables  him  to 
adopt  an  attitude  of  empirical  realism  towards  the  phenomenal 
world.  He  believes  that  although,  or  rather  because,  the  phe- 
nomenal world  is  the  joint  product  of  things  and  the  human 
mind,  it  must  be  made  up  of  permanent  substances  which 
interact  causally  in  space ;  and  he  also  believes  that  the  accidents 
of  these  permanent  substances  are  directly  present  to  human 
minds.  That  is  to  say,  he  claims  to  avoid  the  errors  of  represen- 
tational idealism,  and  to  justify  that  empirical  realism  which 
is  natural  to  science  and  to  common  sense. 

It  is  only  fair  to  take  both  Kant's  transcendental  idealism 
and  his  empirical  realism  as  essential  parts  of  his  doctrine; 
and  we  must  recognise,  if  we  are  to  understand  him  at  all,  that 
on  his  view  they  are  mutually  interdependent.1 

1  In  this  respect  they  differ  from  the  subjectivism  and  phenomena- 
lism which  are  attributed  to  Kant  by  Kemp  Smith ;  see,  for  example, 
Commentary,  pp.  270  ff.  and  many  other  places.  Subjectivism  and 
phenomenalism  are  alleged  to  be  obscurely  felt  tendencies  which 
Kant  had  never  thought  out,  whose  inconsistency  he  had  never 
realised,  and  between  which  he  oscillated  blindly  (Commentary,  p.  227 
and  p.  272).  Unfortunately  Kemp  Smith  regards  phenomenalism  as 
involving  the  view  that  'the  synthetic  processes  are  of  a  noumenal 
character*  (p.  275),  and  that  these  processes  must  'take  place  and 
complete  themselves  before  any  consciousness  can  exist  at  all'  (p.  277). 
Subjectivism  he  takes  to  involve  the  view  that  'the  synthetic  activities 
consist  of  the  various  cognitive  processes  of  the  individual  mind* 
(p.  274).  I  am  unable  to  accept  either  of  these  views  as  satisfactory 
interpretations  of  Kant,  and  so  far  as  phenomenalism  involves  nou- 
menal synthesis,  I  do  not  think  it  is  Kantian  at  all.  I  believe  that  there 
is  a  real  difficulty  in  reconciling  Kant's  view  that  the  phenomenal 
world  exists  only  in  relation  to  human  minds  with  his  view  that  the 
phenomenal  world  is  a  common  world  made  up  of  permanent  physical 
substances  in  space.  The  former  view  might  reasonably  be  called 
'subjectivism*  and  the  latter  'phenomenalism',  and  I  believe  that 


584      THE  TRANSCENDENTAL  DEDUCTION    [XXXI  §11 

§11.  Limits  of  the  Present  Argument 

Throughout  the  whole  of  this  exposition  I  have  sought  to 
dwell  mainly  upon  the  reality  of  the  factors  found  in  experience 
by  Kant  and  the  plausibility  of  his  theories  about  them;  but 
I  do  not  wish  to  give  the  impression  that  his  theories  offer 
the  only  possible  interpretation  of  these  factors,  and  still,  less 
that  his  theories  are  devoid  of  difficulty. 

I  have  insisted,  for  example,  that  synthesis  is  a  real  factor 
in  experience,  and  that  if  it  is  ignored,  no  account  of  experience 
can  be  complete.  Such  a  contention  is  not  intended  to  imply 
that  the  presence  of  synthesis  in  experience  is  by  itself  a  suffi- 
cient refutation  of  realistic  philosophies.  It  may  be  possible 
to  maintain  that  synthesis  is  merely  a  taking  up  and  holding 
together  of  what  already  exists  in  combination  in  a  reality 
independent  of  the  mind.1  Even  if  that  were  so,2  it  would  still 
be  necessary  to  remember  that  the  synthesis  in  question  is 
a  synthesis  of  times  and  spaces,  and  from  this  fact  important 
consequences  might  spring.  Our  main  concern,  however, 
is  Kant's  view  that  the  synthesis  of  times  and  spaces  must 
conform  to  the  principles  of  synthesis  implicit  in  judgement. 
At  the  present  stage  of  the  argument  that  view  should  be 
regarded  as  neither  arbitrary  nor  unreasonable.  Our  task 
is  to  understand  it  so  that  we  can  appreciate  Kant's  attempts 
to  work  it  out  in  detail  later. 

Similarly  we  need  not  attempt  at  the  present  stage  to  face 
the  difficulties  which  are  raised  by  Kant's  doctrine  as  a  whole ; 

Kemp  Smith  is  in  part  attempting  to  deal  with  this  opposition.  But 
if  so,  he  seems  to  me  to  misdescribe  both  the  factors  in  this  opposition ; 
and  when  Kant's  subjectivism  and  phenomenalism  are  taken  in  this 
sense,  it  is  absolutely  essential  to  recognise  that  Kant  believed  them 
to  be  mutually  interdependent. 

1  The  fact  of  synthesis  is  fully  recognised,  for  example,  in  Price's 
Perception,  and  although  he  works  on  a  realistic  basis,  he  has,  if  I 
mistake  not,  learned  a  great  deal  from  Immanuel  Kant. 

2  I  cannot  see  how  it  could  be  so  without  involving  us  in  a  doctrine 
of  pre-established  harmony,  if  we  admit,  as  I  think  Price  does,  that 
the  form  of  our  synthesis  is  a  priori;  and  I  find  it  difficult  to  believe 
that  any  doctrine  of  pre-established  harmony  can  be  satisfactory. 


XXXI  §n]      THE  FACTORS  IN  EXPERIENCE  585 

and  indeed  we  are  not  in  a  position  to  do  so  until  we  have 
gone  much  further  into  the  details.  The  central  difficulty, 
as  I  see  it,  is  how  we  can  have  a  common  phenomenal  world, 
or  common  world  of  experience,  if  the  matter  of  that  world 
is  made  up  of  our  private  sense-impressions,  and  the  form 
is  due  to  the  nature  of  human  sensibility  and  human  thought.1 
There  are  countless  other  difficulties,  notably  as  to  the  place 
of  secondary  qualities  in  this  common  world  and  the  relation 
between  the  history  of  the  individual  mind  on  the  one  hand 
and  the  succession  of  changes  in  the  physical  world  on  the 
other.  How  far  Kant  offers,  or  is  capable  of  offering,  a  solution 
of  these  difficulties  is  a  question  upon  which  opinions  may 
differ.  We  ought  indeed  to  be  aware  of  these  difficulties  already, 
and  we  should  have  an  entirely  false  view  of  the  argument, 
if  we  supposed  that  they  had  already  found  their  solution; 
yet  our  only  hope  of  understanding  Kant  is  not  to  raise  these 
problems  prematurely,  but  to  follow,  as  best  we  can,  the 
development  of  his  argument. 

1 1  have  touched  upon  this  difficulty  in  Chapter  XXIV  §  4.  Here 
I  would  merely  remind  the  reader  that  the  common  objective  world 
is  the  world  as  it  must  appear  to  human  consciousness  as  such,  or 
to  consciousness  in  general,  not  the  world  as  it  must  appear  merely 
to  an  individual  mind.  Kant  deals  throughout,  not  with  the  individual 
acts  of  the  individual  mind  as  such  with  all  its  peculiarities,  but  with 
those  elements  in  all  individual  mental  acts  which  are  necessary  to 
experience;  and  the  world  whose  character  he  seeks  to  establish  is 
the  world  as  it  must  be  for  science.
