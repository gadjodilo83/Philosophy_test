BOOK I

Part 1 

When the objects of an inquiry, in any department, have principles,
conditions, or elements, it is through acquaintance with these that
knowledge, that is to say scientific knowledge, is attained. For we
do not think that we know a thing until we are acquainted with its
primary conditions or first principles, and have carried our analysis
as far as its simplest elements. Plainly therefore in the science
of Nature, as in other branches of study, our first task will be to
try to determine what relates to its principles. 

The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which are
more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are
clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things are not 'knowable
relatively to us' and 'knowable' without qualification. So in the
present inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is
more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear
and more knowable by nature. 

Now what is to us plain and obvious at first is rather confused masses,
the elements and principles of which become known to us later by analysis.
Thus we must advance from generalities to particulars; for it is a
whole that is best known to sense-perception, and a generality is
a kind of whole, comprehending many things within it, like parts.
Much the same thing happens in the relation of the name to the formula.
A name, e.g. 'round', means vaguely a sort of whole: its definition
analyses this into its particular senses. Similarly a child begins
by calling all men 'father', and all women 'mother', but later on
distinguishes each of them. 

Part 2

The principles in question must be either (a) one or (b) more than
one. If (a) one, it must be either (i) motionless, as Parmenides and
Melissus assert, or (ii) in motion, as the physicists hold, some declaring
air to be the first principle, others water. If (b) more than one,
then either (i) a finite or (ii) an infinite plurality. If (i) finite
(but more than one), then either two or three or four or some other
number. If (ii) infinite, then either as Democritus believed one in
kind, but differing in shape or form; or different in kind and even
contrary. 

A similar inquiry is made by those who inquire into the number of
existents: for they inquire whether the ultimate constituents of existing
things are one or many, and if many, whether a finite or an infinite
plurality. So they too are inquiring whether the principle or element
is one or many. 

Now to investigate whether Being is one and motionless is not a contribution
to the science of Nature. For just as the geometer has nothing more
to say to one who denies the principles of his science-this being
a question for a different science or for or common to all-so a man
investigating principles cannot argue with one who denies their existence.
For if Being is just one, and one in the way mentioned, there is a
principle no longer, since a principle must be the principle of some
thing or things. 

To inquire therefore whether Being is one in this sense would be like
arguing against any other position maintained for the sake of argument
(such as the Heraclitean thesis, or such a thesis as that Being is
one man) or like refuting a merely contentious argument-a description
which applies to the arguments both of Melissus and of Parmenides:
their premisses are false and their conclusions do not follow. Or
rather the argument of Melissus is gross and palpable and offers no
difficulty at all: accept one ridiculous proposition and the rest
follows-a simple enough proceeding. 

We physicists, on the other hand, must take for granted that the things
that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in motion which
is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover, no man of science is
bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be raised, but only
as many as are drawn falsely from the principles of the science: it
is not our business to refute those that do not arise in this way:
just as it is the duty of the geometer to refute the squaring of the
circle by means of segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon's
proof. At the same time the holders of the theory of which we are
speaking do incidentally raise physical questions, though Nature is
not their subject: so it will perhaps be as well to spend a few words
on them, especially as the inquiry is not without scientific interest.

The most pertinent question with which to begin will be this: In what
sense is it asserted that all things are one? For 'is' is used in
many senses. Do they mean that all things 'are' substance or quantities
or qualities? And, further, are all things one substance-one man,
one horse, or one soul-or quality and that one and the same-white
or hot or something of the kind? These are all very different doctrines
and all impossible to maintain. 

For if both substance and quantity and quality are, then, whether
these exist independently of each other or not, Being will be many.

If on the other hand it is asserted that all things are quality or
quantity, then, whether substance exists or not, an absurdity results,
if the impossible can properly be called absurd. For none of the others
can exist independently: substance alone is independent: for everything
is predicated of substance as subject. Now Melissus says that Being
is infinite. It is then a quantity. For the infinite is in the category
of quantity, whereas substance or quality or affection cannot be infinite
except through a concomitant attribute, that is, if at the same time
they are also quantities. For to define the infinite you must use
quantity in your formula, but not substance or quality. If then Being
is both substance and quantity, it is two, not one: if only substance,
it is not infinite and has no magnitude; for to have that it will
have to be a quantity. 

Again, 'one' itself, no less than 'being', is used in many senses,
so we must consider in what sense the word is used when it is said
that the All is one. 

Now we say that (a) the continuous is one or that (b) the indivisible
is one, or (c) things are said to be 'one', when their essence is
one and the same, as 'liquor' and 'drink'. 

If (a) their One is one in the sense of continuous, it is many, for
the continuous is divisible ad infinitum. 

There is, indeed, a difficulty about part and whole, perhaps not relevant
to the present argument, yet deserving consideration on its own account-namely,
whether the part and the whole are one or more than one, and how they
can be one or many, and, if they are more than one, in what sense
they are more than one. (Similarly with the parts of wholes which
are not continuous.) Further, if each of the two parts is indivisibly
one with the whole, the difficulty arises that they will be indivisibly
one with each other also. 

But to proceed: If (b) their One is one as indivisible, nothing will
have quantity or quality, and so the one will not be infinite, as
Melissus says-nor, indeed, limited, as Parmenides says, for though
the limit is indivisible, the limited is not. 

But if (c) all things are one in the sense of having the same definition,
like 'raiment' and 'dress', then it turns out that they are maintaining
the Heraclitean doctrine, for it will be the same thing 'to be good'
and 'to be bad', and 'to be good' and 'to be not good', and so the
same thing will be 'good' and 'not good', and man and horse; in fact,
their view will be, not that all things are one, but that they are
nothing; and that 'to be of such-and-such a quality' is the same as
'to be of such-and-such a size'. 

Even the more recent of the ancient thinkers were in a pother lest
the same thing should turn out in their hands both one and many. So
some, like Lycophron, were led to omit 'is', others to change the
mode of expression and say 'the man has been whitened' instead of
'is white', and 'walks' instead of 'is walking', for fear that if
they added the word 'is' they should be making the one to be many-as
if 'one' and 'being' were always used in one and the same sense. What
'is' may be many either in definition (for example 'to be white' is
one thing, 'to be musical' another, yet the same thing be both, so
the one is many) or by division, as the whole and its parts. On this
point, indeed, they were already getting into difficulties and admitted
that the one was many-as if there was any difficulty about the same
thing being both one and many, provided that these are not opposites;
for 'one' may mean either 'potentially one' or 'actually one'.

Part 3

If, then, we approach the thesis in this way it seems impossible for
all things to be one. Further, the arguments they use to prove their
position are not difficult to expose. For both of them reason contentiously-I
mean both Melissus and Parmenides. [Their premisses are false and
their conclusions do not follow. Or rather the argument of Melissus
is gross and palpable and offers no difficulty at all: admit one ridiculous
proposition and the rest follows-a simple enough proceeding.] The
fallacy of Melissus is obvious. For he supposes that the assumption
'what has come into being always has a beginning' justifies the assumption
'what has not come into being has no beginning'. Then this also is
absurd, that in every case there should be a beginning of the thing-not
of the time and not only in the case of coming to be in the full sense
but also in the case of coming to have a quality-as if change never
took place suddenly. Again, does it follow that Being, if one, is
motionless? Why should it not move, the whole of it within itself,
as parts of it do which are unities, e.g. this water? Again, why is
qualitative change impossible? But, further, Being cannot be one in
form, though it may be in what it is made of. (Even some of the physicists
hold it to be one in the latter way, though not in the former.) Man
obviously differs from horse in form, and contraries from each other.

The same kind of argument holds good against Parmenides also, besides
any that may apply specially to his view: the answer to him being
that 'this is not true' and 'that does not follow'. His assumption
that one is used in a single sense only is false, because it is used
in several. His conclusion does not follow, because if we take only
white things, and if 'white' has a single meaning, none the less what
is white will be many and not one. For what is white will not be one
either in the sense that it is continuous or in the sense that it
must be defined in only one way. 'Whiteness' will be different from
'what has whiteness'. Nor does this mean that there is anything that
can exist separately, over and above what is white. For 'whiteness'
and 'that which is white' differ in definition, not in the sense that
they are things which can exist apart from each other. But Parmenides
had not come in sight of this distinction. 

It is necessary for him, then, to assume not only that 'being' has
the same meaning, of whatever it is predicated, but further that it
means (1) what just is and (2) what is just one. 

It must be so, for (1) an attribute is predicated of some subject,
so that the subject to which 'being' is attributed will not be, as
it is something different from 'being'. Something, therefore, which
is not will be. Hence 'substance' will not be a predicate of anything
else. For the subject cannot be a being, unless 'being' means several
things, in such a way that each is something. But ex hypothesi 'being'
means only one thing. 

If, then, 'substance' is not attributed to anything, but other things
are attributed to it, how does 'substance' mean what is rather than
what is not? For suppose that 'substance' is also 'white'. Since the
definition of the latter is different (for being cannot even be attributed
to white, as nothing is which is not 'substance'), it follows that
'white' is not-being--and that not in the sense of a particular not-being,
but in the sense that it is not at all. Hence 'substance' is not;
for it is true to say that it is white, which we found to mean not-being.
If to avoid this we say that even 'white' means substance, it follows
that 'being' has more than one meaning. 

In particular, then, Being will not have magnitude, if it is substance.
For each of the two parts must he in a different sense. 

(2) Substance is plainly divisible into other substances, if we consider
the mere nature of a definition. For instance, if 'man' is a substance,
'animal' and 'biped' must also be substances. For if not substances,
they must be attributes-and if attributes, attributes either of (a)
man or of (b) some other subject. But neither is possible.

(a) An attribute is either that which may or may not belong to the
subject or that in whose definition the subject of which it is an
attribute is involved. Thus 'sitting' is an example of a separable
attribute, while 'snubness' contains the definition of 'nose', to
which we attribute snubness. Further, the definition of the whole
is not contained in the definitions of the contents or elements of
the definitory formula; that of 'man' for instance in 'biped', or
that of 'white man' in 'white'. If then this is so, and if 'biped'
is supposed to be an attribute of 'man', it must be either separable,
so that 'man' might possibly not be 'biped', or the definition of
'man' must come into the definition of 'biped'-which is impossible,
as the converse is the case. 

(b) If, on the other hand, we suppose that 'biped' and 'animal' are
attributes not of man but of something else, and are not each of them
a substance, then 'man' too will be an attribute of something else.
But we must assume that substance is not the attribute of anything,
that the subject of which both 'biped' and 'animal' and each separately
are predicated is the subject also of the complex 'biped animal'.

Are we then to say that the All is composed of indivisible substances?
Some thinkers did, in point of fact, give way to both arguments. To
the argument that all things are one if being means one thing, they
conceded that not-being is; to that from bisection, they yielded by
positing atomic magnitudes. But obviously it is not true that if being
means one thing, and cannot at the same time mean the contradictory
of this, there will be nothing which is not, for even if what is not
cannot be without qualification, there is no reason why it should
not be a particular not-being. To say that all things will be one,
if there is nothing besides Being itself, is absurd. For who understands
'being itself' to be anything but a particular substance? But if this
is so, there is nothing to prevent there being many beings, as has
been said. 

It is, then, clearly impossible for Being to be one in this sense.

Part 4

The physicists on the other hand have two modes of explanation.

The first set make the underlying body one either one of the three
or something else which is denser than fire and rarer than air then
generate everything else from this, and obtain multiplicity by condensation
and rarefaction. Now these are contraries, which may be generalized
into 'excess and defect'. (Compare Plato's 'Great and Small'-except
that he make these his matter, the one his form, while the others
treat the one which underlies as matter and the contraries as differentiae,
i.e. forms). 

The second set assert that the contrarieties are contained in the
one and emerge from it by segregation, for example Anaximander and
also all those who assert that 'what is' is one and many, like Empedocles
and Anaxagoras; for they too produce other things from their mixture
by segregation. These differ, however, from each other in that the
former imagines a cycle of such changes, the latter a single series.
Anaxagoras again made both his 'homceomerous' substances and his contraries
infinite in multitude, whereas Empedocles posits only the so-called
elements. 

The theory of Anaxagoras that the principles are infinite in multitude
was probably due to his acceptance of the common opinion of the physicists
that nothing comes into being from not-being. For this is the reason
why they use the phrase 'all things were together' and the coming
into being of such and such a kind of thing is reduced to change of
quality, while some spoke of combination and separation. Moreover,
the fact that the contraries proceed from each other led them to the
conclusion. The one, they reasoned, must have already existed in the
other; for since everything that comes into being must arise either
from what is or from what is not, and it is impossible for it to arise
from what is not (on this point all the physicists agree), they thought
that the truth of the alternative necessarily followed, namely that
things come into being out of existent things, i.e. out of things
already present, but imperceptible to our senses because of the smallness
of their bulk. So they assert that everything has been mixed in every.
thing, because they saw everything arising out of everything. But
things, as they say, appear different from one another and receive
different names according to the nature of the particles which are
numerically predominant among the innumerable constituents of the
mixture. For nothing, they say, is purely and entirely white or black
or sweet, bone or flesh, but the nature of a thing is held to be that
of which it contains the most. 

Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is infinite
in multitude or size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite
in variety of kind is unknowable in quality. But the principles in
question are infinite both in multitude and in kind. Therefore it
is impossible to know things which are composed of them; for it is
when we know the nature and quantity of its components that we suppose
we know a complex. 

Further (2) if the parts of a whole may be of any size in the direction
either of greatness or of smallness (by 'parts' I mean components
into which a whole can be divided and which are actually present in
it), it is necessary that the whole thing itself may be of any size.
Clearly, therefore, since it is impossible for an animal or plant
to be indefinitely big or small, neither can its parts be such, or
the whole will be the same. But flesh, bone, and the like are the
parts of animals, and the fruits are the parts of plants. Hence it
is obvious that neither flesh, bone, nor any such thing can be of
indefinite size in the direction either of the greater or of the less.

Again (3) according to the theory all such things are already present
in one another and do not come into being but are constituents which
are separated out, and a thing receives its designation from its chief
constituent. Further, anything may come out of anything-water by segregation
from flesh and flesh from water. Hence, since every finite body is
exhausted by the repeated abstraction of a finite body, it seems obviously
to follow that everything cannot subsist in everything else. For let
flesh be extracted from water and again more flesh be produced from
the remainder by repeating the process of separation: then, even though
the quantity separated out will continually decrease, still it will
not fall below a certain magnitude. If, therefore, the process comes
to an end, everything will not be in everything else (for there will
be no flesh in the remaining water); if on the other hand it does
not, and further extraction is always possible, there will be an infinite
multitude of finite equal particles in a finite quantity-which is
impossible. Another proof may be added: Since every body must diminish
in size when something is taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively
definite in respect both of greatness and smallness, it is clear that
from the minimum quantity of flesh no body can be separated out; for
the flesh left would be less than the minimum of flesh. 

Lastly (4) in each of his infinite bodies there would be already present
infinite flesh and blood and brain- having a distinct existence, however,
from one another, and no less real than the infinite bodies, and each
infinite: which is contrary to reason. 

The statement that complete separation never will take place is correct
enough, though Anaxagoras is not fully aware of what it means. For
affections are indeed inseparable. If then colours and states had
entered into the mixture, and if separation took place, there would
be a 'white' or a 'healthy' which was nothing but white or healthy,
i.e. was not the predicate of a subject. So his 'Mind' is an absurd
person aiming at the impossible, if he is supposed to wish to separate
them, and it is impossible to do so, both in respect of quantity and
of quality- of quantity, because there is no minimum magnitude, and
of quality, because affections are inseparable. 

Nor is Anaxagoras right about the coming to be of homogeneous bodies.
It is true there is a sense in which clay is divided into pieces of
clay, but there is another in which it is not. Water and air are,
and are generated 'from' each other, but not in the way in which bricks
come 'from' a house and again a house 'from' bricks; and it is better
to assume a smaller and finite number of principles, as Empedocles
does. 

Part 5

All thinkers then agree in making the contraries principles, both
those who describe the All as one and unmoved (for even Parmenides
treats hot and cold as principles under the names of fire and earth)
and those too who use the rare and the dense. The same is true of
Democritus also, with his plenum and void, both of which exist, be
says, the one as being, the other as not-being. Again he speaks of
differences in position, shape, and order, and these are genera of
which the species are contraries, namely, of position, above and below,
before and behind; of shape, angular and angle-less, straight and
round. 

It is plain then that they all in one way or another identify the
contraries with the principles. And with good reason. For first principles
must not be derived from one another nor from anything else, while
everything has to be derived from them. But these conditions are fulfilled
by the primary contraries, which are not derived from anything else
because they are primary, nor from each other because they are contraries.

But we must see how this can be arrived at as a reasoned result, as
well as in the way just indicated. 

Our first presupposition must be that in nature nothing acts on, or
is acted on by, any other thing at random, nor may anything come from
anything else, unless we mean that it does so in virtue of a concomitant
attribute. For how could 'white' come from 'musical', unless 'musical'
happened to be an attribute of the not-white or of the black? No,
'white' comes from 'not-white'-and not from any 'not-white', but from
black or some intermediate colour. Similarly, 'musical' comes to be
from 'not-musical', but not from any thing other than musical, but
from 'unmusical' or any intermediate state there may be.

Nor again do things pass into the first chance thing; 'white' does
not pass into 'musical' (except, it may be, in virtue of a concomitant
attribute), but into 'not-white'-and not into any chance thing which
is not white, but into black or an intermediate colour; 'musical'
passes into 'not-musical'-and not into any chance thing other than
musical, but into 'unmusical' or any intermediate state there may
be. 

The same holds of other things also: even things which are not simple
but complex follow the same principle, but the opposite state has
not received a name, so we fail to notice the fact. What is in tune
must come from what is not in tune, and vice versa; the tuned passes
into untunedness-and not into any untunedness, but into the corresponding
opposite. It does not matter whether we take attunement, order, or
composition for our illustration; the principle is obviously the same
in all, and in fact applies equally to the production of a house,
a statue, or any other complex. A house comes from certain things
in a certain state of separation instead of conjunction, a statue
(or any other thing that has been shaped) from shapelessness-each
of these objects being partly order and partly composition.

If then this is true, everything that comes to be or passes away from,
or passes into, its contrary or an intermediate state. But the intermediates
are derived from the contraries-colours, for instance, from black
and white. Everything, therefore, that comes to be by a natural process
is either a contrary or a product of contraries. 

Up to this point we have practically had most of the other writers
on the subject with us, as I have said already: for all of them identify
their elements, and what they call their principles, with the contraries,
giving no reason indeed for the theory, but contrained as it were
by the truth itself. They differ, however, from one another in that
some assume contraries which are more primary, others contraries which
are less so: some those more knowable in the order of explanation,
others those more familiar to sense. For some make hot and cold, or
again moist and dry, the conditions of becoming; while others make
odd and even, or again Love and Strife; and these differ from each
other in the way mentioned. 

Hence their principles are in one sense the same, in another different;
different certainly, as indeed most people think, but the same inasmuch
as they are analogous; for all are taken from the same table of columns,
some of the pairs being wider, others narrower in extent. In this
way then their theories are both the same and different, some better,
some worse; some, as I have said, take as their contraries what is
more knowable in the order of explanation, others what is more familiar
to sense. (The universal is more knowable in the order of explanation,
the particular in the order of sense: for explanation has to do with
the universal, sense with the particular.) 'The great and the small',
for example, belong to the former class, 'the dense and the rare'
to the latter. 

It is clear then that our principles must be contraries.

Part 6

The next question is whether the principles are two or three or more
in number. 

One they cannot be, for there cannot be one contrary. Nor can they
be innumerable, because, if so, Being will not be knowable: and in
any one genus there is only one contrariety, and substance is one
genus: also a finite number is sufficient, and a finite number, such
as the principles of Empedocles, is better than an infinite multitude;
for Empedocles professes to obtain from his principles all that Anaxagoras
obtains from his innumerable principles. Lastly, some contraries are
more primary than others, and some arise from others-for example sweet
and bitter, white and black-whereas the principles must always remain
principles. 

This will suffice to show that the principles are neither one nor
innumerable. 

Granted, then, that they are a limited number, it is plausible to
suppose them more than two. For it is difficult to see how either
density should be of such a nature as to act in any way on rarity
or rarity on density. The same is true of any other pair of contraries;
for Love does not gather Strife together and make things out of it,
nor does Strife make anything out of Love, but both act on a third
thing different from both. Some indeed assume more than one such thing
from which they construct the world of nature. 

Other objections to the view that it is not necessary to assume a
third principle as a substratum may be added. (1) We do not find that
the contraries constitute the substance of any thing. But what is
a first principle ought not to be the predicate of any subject. If
it were, there would be a principle of the supposed principle: for
the subject is a principle, and prior presumably to what is predicated
of it. Again (2) we hold that a substance is not contrary to another
substance. How then can substance be derived from what are not substances?
Or how can non-substances be prior to substance? 

If then we accept both the former argument and this one, we must,
to preserve both, assume a third somewhat as the substratum of the
contraries, such as is spoken of by those who describe the All as
one nature-water or fire or what is intermediate between them. What
is intermediate seems preferable; for fire, earth, air, and water
are already involved with pairs of contraries. There is, therefore,
much to be said for those who make the underlying substance different
from these four; of the rest, the next best choice is air, as presenting
sensible differences in a less degree than the others; and after air,
water. All, however, agree in this, that they differentiate their
One by means of the contraries, such as density and rarity and more
and less, which may of course be generalized, as has already been
said into excess and defect. Indeed this doctrine too (that the One
and excess and defect are the principles of things) would appear to
be of old standing, though in different forms; for the early thinkers
made the two the active and the one the passive principle, whereas
some of the more recent maintain the reverse. 

To suppose then that the elements are three in number would seem,
from these and similar considerations, a plausible view, as I said
before. On the other hand, the view that they are more than three
in number would seem to be untenable. 

For the one substratum is sufficient to be acted on; but if we have
four contraries, there will be two contrarieties, and we shall have
to suppose an intermediate nature for each pair separately. If, on
the other hand, the contrarieties, being two, can generate from each
other, the second contrariety will be superfluous. Moreover, it is
impossible that there should be more than one primary contrariety.
For substance is a single genus of being, so that the principles can
differ only as prior and posterior, not in genus; in a single genus
there is always a single contrariety, all the other contrarieties
in it being held to be reducible to one. 

It is clear then that the number of elements is neither one nor more
than two or three; but whether two or three is, as I said, a question
of considerable difficulty. 

Part 7

We will now give our own account, approaching the question first with
reference to becoming in its widest sense: for we shall be following
the natural order of inquiry if we speak first of common characteristics,
and then investigate the characteristics of special cases.

We say that one thing comes to be from another thing, and one sort
of thing from another sort of thing, both in the case of simple and
of complex things. I mean the following. We can say (1) 'man becomes
musical', (2) what is 'not-musical becomes musical', or (3), the 'not-musical
man becomes a musical man'. Now what becomes in (1) and (2)-'man'
and 'not musical'-I call simple, and what each becomes-'musical'-simple
also. But when (3) we say the 'not-musical man becomes a musical man',
both what becomes and what it becomes are complex. 

As regards one of these simple 'things that become' we say not only
'this becomes so-and-so', but also 'from being this, comes to be so-and-so',
as 'from being not-musical comes to be musical'; as regards the other
we do not say this in all cases, as we do not say (1) 'from being
a man he came to be musical' but only 'the man became musical'.

When a 'simple' thing is said to become something, in one case (1)
it survives through the process, in the other (2) it does not. For
man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas
what is not musical or is unmusical does not continue to exist, either
simply or combined with the subject. 

These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various
cases of becoming in the way we are describing that, as we say, there
must always be an underlying something, namely that which becomes,
and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is
not one. (By that I mean that it can be described in different ways.)
For 'to be man' is not the same as 'to be unmusical'. One part survives,
the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for 'man' survives),
but 'not-musical' or 'unmusical' does not survive, nor does the compound
of the two, namely 'unmusical man'. 

We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming that'
more in the case of what does not survive the change-'becoming musical
from unmusical', not 'from man'-but there are exceptions, as we sometimes
use the latter form of expression even of what survives; we speak
of 'a statue coming to be from bronze', not of the 'bronze becoming
a statue'. The change, however, from an opposite which does not survive
is described indifferently in both ways, 'becoming that from this'
or 'this becoming that'. We say both that 'the unmusical becomes musical',
and that 'from unmusical he becomes musical'. And so both forms are
used of the complex, 'becoming a musical man from an unmusical man',
and unmusical man becoming a musical man'. 

But there are different senses of 'coming to be'. In some cases we
do not use the expression 'come to be', but 'come to be so-and-so'.
Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified sense.

Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must
be some subject, namely, that which becomes. For we know that when
a thing comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation,
time, or place, a subject is always presupposed, since substance alone
is not predicated of another subject, but everything else of substance.

But that substances too, and anything else that can be said 'to be'
without qualification, come to be from some substratum, will appear
on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies
from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals
and plants from seed. 

Generally things which come to be, come to be in different ways: (1)
by change of shape, as a statue; (2) by addition, as things which
grow; (3) by taking away, as the Hermes from the stone; (4) by putting
together, as a house; (5) by alteration, as things which 'turn' in
respect of their material substance. 

It is plain that these are all cases of coming to be from a substratum.

Thus, clearly, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always
complex. There is, on the one hand, (a) something which comes into
existence, and again (b) something which becomes that-the latter (b)
in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the 'opposite'
I mean the 'unmusical', by the 'subject' 'man', and similarly I call
the absence of shape or form or order the 'opposite', and the bronze
or stone or gold the 'subject'. 

Plainly then, if there are conditions and principles which constitute
natural objects and from which they primarily are or have come to
be-have come to be, I mean, what each is said to be in its essential
nature, not what each is in respect of a concomitant attribute-plainly,
I say, everything comes to be from both subject and form. For 'musical
man' is composed (in a way) of 'man' and 'musical': you can analyse
it into the definitions of its elements. It is clear then that what
comes to be will come to be from these elements. 

Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For
it is the man, the gold-the 'matter' generally-that is counted, for
it is more of the nature of a 'this', and what comes to be does not
come from it in virtue of a concomitant attribute; the privation,
on the other hand, and the contrary are incidental in the process.)
And the positive form is one-the order, the acquired art of music,
or any similar predicate. 

There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles
to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the
contraries are the principles-say for example the musical and the
unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned-and a sense
in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to
be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the
fact that the substratum is different from the contraries, for it
is itself not a contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way,
not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two, nor yet
precisely two, since there is a difference of essential nature, but
three. For 'to be man' is different from 'to be unmusical', and 'to
be unformed' from 'to be bronze'. 

We have now stated the number of the principles of natural objects
which are subject to generation, and how the number is reached: and
it is clear that there must be a substratum for the contraries, and
that the contraries must be two. (Yet in another way of putting it
this is not necessary, as one of the contraries will serve to effect
the change by its successive absence and presence.) 

The underlying nature is an object of scientific knowledge, by an
analogy. For as the bronze is to the statue, the wood to the bed,
or the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing
which has form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the
'this' or existent. 

This then is one principle (though not one or existent in the same
sense as the 'this'), and the definition was one as we agreed; then
further there is its contrary, the privation. In what sense these
are two, and in what sense more, has been stated above. Briefly, we
explained first that only the contraries were principles, and later
that a substratum was indispensable, and that the principles were
three; our last statement has elucidated the difference between the
contraries, the mutual relation of the principles, and the nature
of the substratum. Whether the form or the substratum is the essential
nature of a physical object is not yet clear. But that the principles
are three, and in what sense, and the way in which each is a principle,
is clear. 

So much then for the question of the number and the nature of the
principles. 

Part 8

We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early thinkers,
as well as our own, is solved in this way alone. 

The first of those who studied science were misled in their search
for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as
it were thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the
things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because
what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not,
both of which are impossible. For what is cannot come to be (because
it is already), and from what is not nothing could have come to be
(because something must be present as a substratum). So too they exaggerated
the consequence of this, and went so far as to deny even the existence
of a plurality of things, maintaining that only Being itself is. Such
then was their opinion, and such the reason for its adoption.

Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something comes
to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or what is does
something or has something done to it or becomes some particular thing',
are to be taken (in the first way of putting our explanation) in the
same sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him',
'is or becomes something from being a doctor.' These expressions may
be taken in two senses, and so too, clearly, may 'from being', and
'being acts or is acted on'. A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor,
but qua housebuilder, and turns gray, not qua doctor, but qua dark-haired.
On the other hand he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we
are using words most appropriately when we say that a doctor does
something or undergoes something, or becomes something from being
a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then
also 'to come to be so-and-so from not-being' means 'qua not-being'.

It was through failure to make this distinction that those thinkers
gave the matter up, and through this error that they went so much
farther astray as to suppose that nothing else comes to be or exists
apart from Being itself, thus doing away with all becoming.

We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can
be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless
we maintain that a thing may 'come to be from what is not'-that is,
in a qualified sense. For a thing comes to be from the privation,
which in its own nature is not-being,-this not surviving as a constituent
of the result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible
that something should come to be in the way described from what is
not. 

In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from being, and
that being does not come to be except in a qualified sense. In that
way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal,
and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind.
Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a horse. The dog would then,
it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a
certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if
anything is to become an animal, not in a qualified sense, it will
not be from animal: and if being, not from being-nor from not-being
either, for it has been explained that by 'from not being' we mean
from not-being qua not-being. 

Note further that we do not subvert the principle that everything
either is or is not. 

This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists in
pointing out that the same things can be explained in terms of potentiality
and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.
So, as we said, the difficulties which constrain people to deny the
existence of some of the things we mentioned are now solved. For it
was this reason which also caused some of the earlier thinkers to
turn so far aside from the road which leads to coming to be and passing
away and change generally. If they had come in sight of this nature,
all their ignorance would have been dispelled. 

Part 9

Others, indeed, have apprehended the nature in question, but not adequately.

In the first place they allow that a thing may come to be without
qualification from not being, accepting on this point the statement
of Parmenides. Secondly, they think that if the substratum is one
numerically, it must have also only a single potentiality-which is
a very different thing. 

Now we distinguish matter and privation, and hold that one of these,
namely the matter, is not-being only in virtue of an attribute which
it has, while the privation in its own nature is not-being; and that
the matter is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation
in no sense is. They, on the other hand, identify their Great and
Small alike with not being, and that whether they are taken together
as one or separately. Their triad is therefore of quite a different
kind from ours. For they got so far as to see that there must be some
underlying nature, but they make it one-for even if one philosopher
makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great and Small, the effect is
the same, for he overlooked the other nature. For the one which persists
is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes to be-a mother, as
it were. But the negative part of the contrariety may often seem,
if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not to exist
at all. 

For admitting with them that there is something divine, good, and
desirable, we hold that there are two other principles, the one contrary
to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for
it. But the consequence of their view is that the contrary desires
its wtextinction. Yet the form cannot desire itself, for it is not
defective; nor can the contrary desire it, for contraries are mutually
destructive. The truth is that what desires the form is matter, as
the female desires the male and the ugly the beautiful-only the ugly
or the female not per se but per accidens. 

The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in another
it does not. As that which contains the privation, it ceases to be
in its own nature, for what ceases to be-the privation-is contained
within it. But as potentiality it does not cease to be in its own
nature, but is necessarily outside the sphere of becoming and ceasing
to be. For if it came to be, something must have existed as a primary
substratum from which it should come and which should persist in it;
but this is its own special nature, so that it will be before coming
to be. (For my definition of matter is just this-the primary substratum
of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and
which persists in the result.) And if it ceases to be it will pass
into that at the last, so it will have ceased to be before ceasing
to be. 

The accurate determination of the first principle in respect of form,
whether it is one or many and what it is or what they are, is the
province of the primary type of science; so these questions may stand
over till then. But of the natural, i.e. perishable, forms we shall
speak in the expositions which follow. 

The above, then, may be taken as sufficient to establish that there
are principles and what they are and how many there are. Now let us
make a fresh start and proceed. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK II

Part 1 

Of things that exist, some exist by nature, some from other causes.

'By nature' the animals and their parts exist, and the plants and
the simple bodies (earth, fire, air, water)-for we say that these
and the like exist 'by nature'. 

All the things mentioned present a feature in which they differ from
things which are not constituted by nature. Each of them has within
itself a principle of motion and of stationariness (in respect of
place, or of growth and decrease, or by way of alteration). On the
other hand, a bed and a coat and anything else of that sort, qua receiving
these designations i.e. in so far as they are products of art-have
no innate impulse to change. But in so far as they happen to be composed
of stone or of earth or of a mixture of the two, they do have such
an impulse, and just to that extent which seems to indicate that nature
is a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to
which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not in virtue
of a concomitant attribute. 

I say 'not in virtue of a concomitant attribute', because (for instance)
a man who is a doctor might cure himself. Nevertheless it is not in
so far as he is a patient that he possesses the art of medicine: it
merely has happened that the same man is doctor and patient-and that
is why these attributes are not always found together. So it is with
all other artificial products. None of them has in itself the source
of its own production. But while in some cases (for instance houses
and the other products of manual labour) that principle is in something
else external to the thing, in others those which may cause a change
in themselves in virtue of a concomitant attribute-it lies in the
things themselves (but not in virtue of what they are). 

'Nature' then is what has been stated. Things 'have a nature'which
have a principle of this kind. Each of them is a substance; for it
is a subject, and nature always implies a subject in which it inheres.

The term 'according to nature' is applied to all these things and
also to the attributes which belong to them in virtue of what they
are, for instance the property of fire to be carried upwards-which
is not a 'nature' nor 'has a nature' but is 'by nature' or 'according
to nature'. 

What nature is, then, and the meaning of the terms 'by nature' and
'according to nature', has been stated. That nature exists, it would
be absurd to try to prove; for it is obvious that there are many things
of this kind, and to prove what is obvious by what is not is the mark
of a man who is unable to distinguish what is self-evident from what
is not. (This state of mind is clearly possible. A man blind from
birth might reason about colours. Presumably therefore such persons
must be talking about words without any thought to correspond.)

Some identify the nature or substance of a natural object with that
immediate constituent of it which taken by itself is without arrangement,
e.g. the wood is the 'nature' of the bed, and the bronze the 'nature'
of the statue. 

As an indication of this Antiphon points out that if you planted a
bed and the rotting wood acquired the power of sending up a shoot,
it would not be a bed that would come up, but wood-which shows that
the arrangement in accordance with the rules of the art is merely
an incidental attribute, whereas the real nature is the other, which,
further, persists continuously through the process of making.

But if the material of each of these objects has itself the same relation
to something else, say bronze (or gold) to water, bones (or wood)
to earth and so on, that (they say) would be their nature and essence.
Consequently some assert earth, others fire or air or water or some
or all of these, to be the nature of the things that are. For whatever
any one of them supposed to have this character-whether one thing
or more than one thing-this or these he declared to be the whole of
substance, all else being its affections, states, or dispositions.
Every such thing they held to be eternal (for it could not pass into
anything else), but other things to come into being and cease to be
times without number. 

This then is one account of 'nature', namely that it is the immediate
material substratum of things which have in themselves a principle
of motion or change. 

Another account is that 'nature' is the shape or form which is specified
in the definition of the thing. 

For the word 'nature' is applied to what is according to nature and
the natural in the same way as 'art' is applied to what is artistic
or a work of art. We should not say in the latter case that there
is anything artistic about a thing, if it is a bed only potentially,
not yet having the form of a bed; nor should we call it a work of
art. The same is true of natural compounds. What is potentially flesh
or bone has not yet its own 'nature', and does not exist until it
receives the form specified in the definition, which we name in defining
what flesh or bone is. Thus in the second sense of 'nature' it would
be the shape or form (not separable except in statement) of things
which have in themselves a source of motion. (The combination of the
two, e.g. man, is not 'nature' but 'by nature' or 'natural'.)

The form indeed is 'nature' rather than the matter; for a thing is
more properly said to be what it is when it has attained to fulfilment
than when it exists potentially. Again man is born from man, but not
bed from bed. That is why people say that the figure is not the nature
of a bed, but the wood is-if the bed sprouted not a bed but wood would
come up. But even if the figure is art, then on the same principle
the shape of man is his nature. For man is born from man.

We also speak of a thing's nature as being exhibited in the process
of growth by which its nature is attained. The 'nature' in this sense
is not like 'doctoring', which leads not to the art of doctoring but
to health. Doctoring must start from the art, not lead to it. But
it is not in this way that nature (in the one sense) is related to
nature (in the other). What grows qua growing grows from something
into something. Into what then does it grow? Not into that from which
it arose but into that to which it tends. The shape then is nature.

'Shape' and 'nature', it should be added, are in two senses. For the
privation too is in a way form. But whether in unqualified coming
to be there is privation, i.e. a contrary to what comes to be, we
must consider later. 

Part 2

We have distinguished, then, the different ways in which the term
'nature' is used. 

The next point to consider is how the mathematician differs from the
physicist. Obviously physical bodies contain surfaces and volumes,
lines and points, and these are the subject-matter of mathematics.

Further, is astronomy different from physics or a department of it?
It seems absurd that the physicist should be supposed to know the
nature of sun or moon, but not to know any of their essential attributes,
particularly as the writers on physics obviously do discuss their
shape also and whether the earth and the world are spherical or not.

Now the mathematician, though he too treats of these things, nevertheless
does not treat of them as the limits of a physical body; nor does
he consider the attributes indicated as the attributes of such bodies.
That is why he separates them; for in thought they are separable from
motion, and it makes no difference, nor does any falsity result, if
they are separated. The holders of the theory of Forms do the same,
though they are not aware of it; for they separate the objects of
physics, which are less separable than those of mathematics. This
becomes plain if one tries to state in each of the two cases the definitions
of the things and of their attributes. 'Odd' and 'even', 'straight'
and 'curved', and likewise 'number', 'line', and 'figure', do not
involve motion; not so 'flesh' and 'bone' and 'man'-these are defined
like 'snub nose', not like 'curved'. 

Similar evidence is supplied by the more physical of the branches
of mathematics, such as optics, harmonics, and astronomy. These are
in a way the converse of geometry. While geometry investigates physical
lines but not qua physical, optics investigates mathematical lines,
but qua physical, not qua mathematical. 

Since 'nature' has two senses, the form and the matter, we must investigate
its objects as we would the essence of snubness. That is, such things
are neither independent of matter nor can be defined in terms of matter
only. Here too indeed one might raise a difficulty. Since there are
two natures, with which is the physicist concerned? Or should he investigate
the combination of the two? But if the combination of the two, then
also each severally. Does it belong then to the same or to different
sciences to know each severally? 

If we look at the ancients, physics would to be concerned with the
matter. (It was only very slightly that Empedocles and Democritus
touched on the forms and the essence.) 

But if on the other hand art imitates nature, and it is the part of
the same discipline to know the form and the matter up to a point
(e.g. the doctor has a knowledge of health and also of bile and phlegm,
in which health is realized, and the builder both of the form of the
house and of the matter, namely that it is bricks and beams, and so
forth): if this is so, it would be the part of physics also to know
nature in both its senses. 

Again, 'that for the sake of which', or the end, belongs to the same
department of knowledge as the means. But the nature is the end or
'that for the sake of which'. For if a thing undergoes a continuous
change and there is a stage which is last, this stage is the end or
'that for the sake of which'. (That is why the poet was carried away
into making an absurd statement when he said 'he has the end for the
sake of which he was born'. For not every stage that is last claims
to be an end, but only that which is best.) 

For the arts make their material (some simply 'make' it, others make
it serviceable), and we use everything as if it was there for our
sake. (We also are in a sense an end. 'That for the sake of which'
has two senses: the distinction is made in our work On Philosophy.)
The arts, therefore, which govern the matter and have knowledge are
two, namely the art which uses the product and the art which directs
the production of it. That is why the using art also is in a sense
directive; but it differs in that it knows the form, whereas the art
which is directive as being concerned with production knows the matter.
For the helmsman knows and prescribes what sort of form a helm should
have, the other from what wood it should be made and by means of what
operations. In the products of art, however, we make the material
with a view to the function, whereas in the products of nature the
matter is there all along. 

Again, matter is a relative term: to each form there corresponds a
special matter. How far then must the physicist know the form or essence?
Up to a point, perhaps, as the doctor must know sinew or the smith
bronze (i.e. until he understands the purpose of each): and the physicist
is concerned only with things whose forms are separable indeed, but
do not exist apart from matter. Man is begotten by man and by the
sun as well. The mode of existence and essence of the separable it
is the business of the primary type of philosophy to define.

Part 3

Now that we have established these distinctions, we must proceed to
consider causes, their character and number. Knowledge is the object
of our inquiry, and men do not think they know a thing till they have
grasped the 'why' of (which is to grasp its primary cause). So clearly
we too must do this as regards both coming to be and passing away
and every kind of physical change, in order that, knowing their principles,
we may try to refer to these principles each of our problems.

In one sense, then, (1) that out of which a thing comes to be and
which persists, is called 'cause', e.g. the bronze of the statue,
the silver of the bowl, and the genera of which the bronze and the
silver are species. 

In another sense (2) the form or the archetype, i.e. the statement
of the essence, and its genera, are called 'causes' (e.g. of the octave
the relation of 2:1, and generally number), and the parts in the definition.

Again (3) the primary source of the change or coming to rest; e.g.
the man who gave advice is a cause, the father is cause of the child,
and generally what makes of what is made and what causes change of
what is changed. 

Again (4) in the sense of end or 'that for the sake of which' a thing
is done, e.g. health is the cause of walking about. ('Why is he walking
about?' we say. 'To be healthy', and, having said that, we think we
have assigned the cause.) The same is true also of all the intermediate
steps which are brought about through the action of something else
as means towards the end, e.g. reduction of flesh, purging, drugs,
or surgical instruments are means towards health. All these things
are 'for the sake of' the end, though they differ from one another
in that some are activities, others instruments. 

This then perhaps exhausts the number of ways in which the term 'cause'
is used. 

As the word has several senses, it follows that there are several
causes of the same thing not merely in virtue of a concomitant attribute),
e.g. both the art of the sculptor and the bronze are causes of the
statue. These are causes of the statue qua statue, not in virtue of
anything else that it may be-only not in the same way, the one being
the material cause, the other the cause whence the motion comes. Some
things cause each other reciprocally, e.g. hard work causes fitness
and vice versa, but again not in the same way, but the one as end,
the other as the origin of change. Further the same thing is the cause
of contrary results. For that which by its presence brings about one
result is sometimes blamed for bringing about the contrary by its
absence. Thus we ascribe the wreck of a ship to the absence of the
pilot whose presence was the cause of its safety. 

All the causes now mentioned fall into four familiar divisions. The
letters are the causes of syllables, the material of artificial products,
fire, &c., of bodies, the parts of the whole, and the premisses of
the conclusion, in the sense of 'that from which'. Of these pairs
the one set are causes in the sense of substratum, e.g. the parts,
the other set in the sense of essence-the whole and the combination
and the form. But the seed and the doctor and the adviser, and generally
the maker, are all sources whence the change or stationariness originates,
while the others are causes in the sense of the end or the good of
the rest; for 'that for the sake of which' means what is best and
the end of the things that lead up to it. (Whether we say the 'good
itself or the 'apparent good' makes no difference.) 

Such then is the number and nature of the kinds of cause.

Now the modes of causation are many, though when brought under heads
they too can be reduced in number. For 'cause' is used in many senses
and even within the same kind one may be prior to another (e.g. the
doctor and the expert are causes of health, the relation 2:1 and number
of the octave), and always what is inclusive to what is particular.
Another mode of causation is the incidental and its genera, e.g. in
one way 'Polyclitus', in another 'sculptor' is the cause of a statue,
because 'being Polyclitus' and 'sculptor' are incidentally conjoined.
Also the classes in which the incidental attribute is included; thus
'a man' could be said to be the cause of a statue or, generally, 'a
living creature'. An incidental attribute too may be more or less
remote, e.g. suppose that 'a pale man' or 'a musical man' were said
to be the cause of the statue. 

All causes, both proper and incidental, may be spoken of either as
potential or as actual; e.g. the cause of a house being built is either
'house-builder' or 'house-builder building'. 

Similar distinctions can be made in the things of which the causes
are causes, e.g. of 'this statue' or of 'statue' or of 'image' generally,
of 'this bronze' or of 'bronze' or of 'material' generally. So too
with the incidental attributes. Again we may use a complex expression
for either and say, e.g. neither 'Polyclitus' nor 'sculptor' but 'Polyclitus,
sculptor'. 

All these various uses, however, come to six in number, under each
of which again the usage is twofold. Cause means either what is particular
or a genus, or an incidental attribute or a genus of that, and these
either as a complex or each by itself; and all six either as actual
or as potential. The
